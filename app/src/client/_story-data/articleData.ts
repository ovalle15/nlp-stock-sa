                "The latest layoffs at Tesla (TSLA) this week cut close to the bone of the EV pioneer’s big competitive advantage — its ubiquitous Supercharger network.As first reported by EV blog Electrek, Tesla laid off nearly the entire Supercharger organization, which was responsible for the build-out of its best-in-class charging network. Major automakers recently signed up to use its NACS (North American Charging Standard) plug.Nearly 500 workers were let go from the group, including senior director Rebecca Tinucci. CEO Elon Musk made the move last week, according to Bloomberg and other sources, and it comes after Musk spearheaded a headcount reduction that totaled over 10% earlier this month. Tesla’s former head of strategic charging programs confirmed the layoffs on X as well.The growth of Tesla’s Supercharger network, totaling 6,249 Supercharger stations and more than 57,000 connectors, will now reportedly slow and construction at certain locations will cease.Musk addressed the Supercharger news on X, stating that the network will grow at “a slower pace” for new locations.Tesla still plans to grow the Supercharger network, just at a slower pace for new locations and more focus on 100% uptime and expansion of existing locations— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 30, 2024What this means for the future of Tesla’s Supercharger network, and the larger EV build-out across the US, is unknown and throws a lot of planning in doubt.President Joe Biden has put tremendous political capital into the EV transformation of the US fleet of cars on the road, including a $7.5 billion build-out of the nation’s EV charging infrastructure. Through the use of public and private funding, the White House targets 500,000 new chargers by the end of the decade via the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program.Tesla is one of the bigger White House partners in the NEVI initiative.\"Tesla has already been awarded money under the federal government's NEVI program; there's no way Mr. Musk would walk away from effectively free money,” said CEO Andres Pinter of Bullet EV Charging, one of Tesla’s Supercharger contractors, to Reuters. Pinter said Tesla’s decision to pause its Supercharger buildout was a “kick in the pants” to his business, leaving current Tesla projects in limbo.Pinter believes that the administration’s “free money” will likely mean Musk reconstituting the charging business, as opposed to abandoning it. And Tesla’s automaker charging partners hope that is the case.Story continuesUS President Joe Biden speaks at the Detroit Auto Show in Michigan, on Sept. 14, 2022. (MANDEL NGAN/AFP via Getty Images) (MANDEL NGAN via Getty Images)Automakers like GM, Ford, Kia, Polestar, Stellantis, Honda, and others have signed up to access the Supercharger network, and will incorporate Tesla’s NACS plug inlet in their future vehicles, under the promise that the Supercharger network would continue to grow at a steady pace.“We have nothing new to announce regarding our plans to transition to NACS [also known as the SAE J3400 standard],” GM said in a statement to Yahoo Finance concerning Tesla’s latest move. “We are continuing to monitor the situation regarding changes to the Supercharger team and the potential impacts.”Ford, which earlier this year received access to the Supercharger via the use of a Tesla-made adapter, said its “plans for our customers do not change” at the moment. Rivian, which also gained access to the Supercharger network this year, told Yahoo Finance that its “owners continue to have access to the Tesla Supercharger Network, and we have begun shipping NACS DC adapters to our customers.”Most of the automakers who responded to Yahoo Finance echoed one another, with Kia also stating that its plans haven’t changed and it will build toward NACS compatibility.The news clearly blindsided Tesla’s automaker partners, with one source at a major automaker telling Yahoo Finance the move by Tesla was “crazy.”“Laying off the Supercharger team is going to slow access to the network for [original equipment manufacturers] … and slow the pace of infrastructure deployment,” said K.C. Boyce, vice president of mobility and energy practices at market research firm Escalent. “[Supercharger layoffs] are going to put a damper on EV sales growth for Tesla and non-Tesla manufacturers.”A Tesla Supercharger is seen at Willow Festival shopping plaza parking lot Wednesday, Aug. 10, 2022, in Northbrook, Ill. (AP Photo/Nam Y. Huh) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)Escalent’s data shows that availability and awareness of charging infrastructure impact buyers' decision to adopt EVs, and Tesla was the first car company to realize and execute on it.Furthermore, Boyce believes Musk’s push into AI and robotaxis, which has been the main focus for investors since Musk's robotaxi reveal date earlier this month, may be at the expense of its successful charging network.Is the Supercharger network worth the cost?While some analysts believe Tesla’s Supercharging business could be worth billions of dollars, others are not so sure.Peter Ramsay, a former energy analyst at Argus and BP and now editor in chief of the EV inFocus newsletter, believes Musk’s move to limit spending in charging was actually a smart move.Ramsay noted in a post published on Wednesday that in Tesla’s Q1 earnings report, “Services & Other” gross profit tumbled by 40% to $81 million, and the “largest material factors” in the segment had nothing to do with charging, but revolved around used car sales profit and parts sales.Moreover, Ramsay cites BNEF estimates that Tesla only generated $1.74 billion last year in charging revenue, or 1.5% of total revenue. While the charging business was expected to grow in upcoming years, the business is still a “fairly insignificant” part of Tesla’s small services division that barely makes any money, relatively speaking.Elon Musk arrives at an event in Los Angeles, April 13, 2024. (Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP, File) (Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP)“Musk’s decision to reduce costs in a non-core area with ongoing high CapEx requirements and little visibility towards attractive profit margins should be seen as understandable, even if perhaps not communicated in the best way,” Ramsay wrote.BNEF saw Tesla (prior to the move to axe the Supercharger team) pulling in $7.4 billion in revenue globally in its charging business by 2030. Tesla pulled in nearly $100 billion in revenue in 2023 alone.The charging business should be able to stand up on its own, Ramsay believes, and then it may be worth something, eventually.“But our view is that charging evolving from [a] tool to help Tesla growth to something judged much more on its prospects as a business opportunity — which could well progress further to a decision around a potential sell-off of the division to a more natural owner — could be overall positive.”Charging a Ford F-150 Lightning at a Tesla Supercharger location in New Jersey. (Pras Subramanian) (Pras Subramanian)Tesla’s move to curtail the growth of the Supercharger network also opens up pathways for other companies to step in.“EVgo is actively engaged in the development of the J3400 standard as a voting member and we look forward to welcoming more Tesla drivers to our network as we add NACS to our nationwide fast charging network,” said Sara Rafalson, EVgo’s senior vice president of market development and public policy, to Yahoo Finance.While EVgo is one of the bigger players in the industry, others believe a new player could emerge and take on what Tesla started.“This unexpected move by Tesla is not indicative of a broader trend or fundamental issue with the EV charging business model. Instead, it points to an open opportunity in the industry,” said Patrick Sullivan, CEO of commercial charging firm EV Realty.Sullivan believes this is a moment for others to step up and lead “version 2.0” of the charging industry, as it moves toward open standards and interoperability. Those 500 or so laid off from Tesla have valuable expertise, he said.“Tesla alumni are already everywhere, including on our own team, where they have been instrumental in helping us build low-cost, high-utilization EV charging solutions for our fleet customers,” Sullivan said. “I have no doubt that we will see the force multiplier of this talented group of professionals once they find new roles at companies in this space.”Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

                'Elon Musk is no longer over-delivering like he used to, but he is still over-promising, according to a top economist, who pointed to the Tesla CEO\'s recent insistence that his EV company should be valued like an AI company.In a Project Syndicate op-ed published on Wednesday, UC Berkeley economics professor and former Treasury official J. Bradford DeLong gave Musk credit for creating a historically important tech company that\'s the "tip of the spear in the transition away from internal-combustion-engine vehicles."Musk\'s rocket company SpaceX also shows great promise, and he has proven to be an effective coach for engineers working on battery technologies, electric vehicles, and rocket science, DeLong added. "Without him, those technologies would not have been pushed forward as much as they have."In fact, while Musk has frequently over-promised, he over-delivered on those fronts, helping Tesla\'s market cap and Musk\'s personal wealth soar since the 2010s, DeLong said.But more recently, he has shifted his focus from EVs, charger networks, and batteries to social media, artificial intelligence, and robotaxis.Even as Musk vowed last month to accelerate plans to launch a new, lower-cost EV model that Wall Streets views as critical to its future, he also reaffirmed his robotaxi ambitions to develop a fleet of autonomous cars.Meanwhile, Tesla\'s surprise firing of its entire Supercharger team raised worries about the key network as well as the industry\'s future. This also comes amid slower EV demand, weaker sales, broader workforce cuts, a steep stock decline, and an exodus of senior leadership."Yet while the over-promising has continued, the over-delivering has not," DeLong wrote. "The fundraiser, cheerleader, and coach for teams developing real technologies has become a meme-stock carnival barker."He pointed to last month\'s Tesla earnings conference call, where Musk exhorted Wall Street analysts to value his company more like a robotics or AI company instead of an auto company. In particular, Tesla should be viewed "almost entirely in terms of solving autonomy" and being able to apply that to a gigantic fleet of cars, the CEO added.But DeLong noted that more than 80% of Tesla\'s first-quarter sales were from automotive revenues, adding that car manufacturing has nowhere near the marginal costs of an IT company, which can write code once and run it everywhere."For all the current Tesla shareholders planning to offload their holdings in the next couple of years, everything hinges on the company succeeding as a meme stock, and Musk is diligently working toward that goal," DeLong warned. "Since there are virtually no long-term Tesla shareholders, the market does not particularly care that the company lacks a CEO who is trying to build it into an enduring profit-making organization."This story was originally featured on Fortune.comView comments',

                'Dive Brief:Rent the Runway on Wednesday announced that Natalie McGrath has been appointed chief marketing officer, effective March 4.She will oversee all aspects of the customer journey, including brand and growth marketing, creative services, public relations and customer service, and report to Co-Founder, CEO and President Jennifer Hyman.McGrath arrives from Afterpay, where she was a marketing vice president, and has prior experience at apparel companies. She spent 10 months as Bandier’s chief marketing officer and had stints at Coach, Alexander Wang and Net-A-Porter, per her LinkedIn page.Dive Insight:Rent the Runway’s marketing plans have escalated in just a few months, culminating in a spot in the C-suite.In December, Chief Financial Officer Sid Thacker told analysts that the apparel rental company had been thriving despite cuts to its marketing budget, and that little would change in the new year.As the new year dawned, however, Rent the Runway unveiled a restructuring plan that entailed laying off 10% of its corporate workforce and cutting the chief operations officer role, and said it would boost its marketing spend.“The company has worked over the past several years to shore up critical aspects of the customer journey to propel growth in 2024 and beyond, and is now focused on investing more into areas of the business that reignite the growth funnel, including marketing, consumer product, customer experience and more, enabling RTR to capture more of the large and growing rental subscription market,” a spokesperson said in a January email to sister publication Fashion Dive.Those goals now fit into McGrath’s job description, and Hyman said in a statement that McGrath has a proven ability to meet them.“We are focused on supercharging our market share by creating emotional and lasting connections with our core customers — and reaching net-new audiences,” Hyman said.Rent the Runway has struggled in recent years, landing on Retail Dive’s bankruptcy watch list for digital natives. The company said it will soon focus anew on workwear, which it called “one of the core use cases for a Rent the Runway subscription.” The company said it’s planning “product, experiential and influencer work around the category beginning this spring.”This story was originally published on Retail Dive.

                "Datadog (DDOG) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this data analytics and cloud monitoring company have returned +6.6%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.6% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Software industry, which Datadog falls in, has gained 3.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Datadog is expected to post earnings of $0.34 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +21.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.42 points to a change of +7.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.73 indicates a change of +22.3% from what Datadog is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Datadog is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Story continuesThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Datadog, the consensus sales estimate of $590.1 million for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +22.5%. The $2.57 billion and $3.14 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +20.7% and +22.2%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryDatadog reported revenues of $589.65 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +25.6%. EPS of $0.44 for the same period compares with $0.26 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $566.7 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.05%. The EPS surprise was +2.33%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Datadog is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Datadog. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

                'Indonesia Energy Corporation LimitedCompany’s Profit Share Increases by More Than 100%Proved Reserves Also Anticipated to Increase Given Extended Contract TermCompany Also Provides Update on Development Plans for 2023 and 2024JAKARTA, INDONESIA AND DANVILLE, CA, Sept. 07, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Indonesia Energy Corporation (NYSE American: INDO) ("IEC"), an oil and gas exploration and production company focused on Indonesia, today announced that its joint operation contract with Pertamina, the Indonesian state-owned oil and gas company, covering the Kruh Block has been amended to extend the contract term by 5 years from May 2030 to September 2035. Kruh Block covers approximately 63,000 acres and is located onshore on the Island of South Sumatra in Indonesia.The amended joint operation contract has the following key terms:The amended contract increases IEC’s after-tax profit split from the current 15% to 35%, for an increase of more than 100%.In addition, given the 5-year extended term of the contract, the amended contract is expected to increase IEC’s proved reserves at Kruh Block by over 40%.Furthermore, given the increased profit split, IEC’s anticipated net cash flow calculations based on its Kruh Block development plan are expected to increase by over 200% versus IEC’s anticipations under the prior contract.IEC also provided an update on its Kruh Block development plan. As previously announced, in order to maximize the production at Kruh Block, IEC is in the process of conducting a workover of the existing Kruh-21 well which was drilled in 2015. Regarding the Kruh-28 well, as previously announced, IEC unexpectedly found evidence of a potential natural gas bearing reservoir between the 976 and 1,006 feet interval with 30 feet net thickness. This initial evidence was supported by both wireline logging and geologic logging data, and subsequent gas flaring. At present, IEC is in the process of sourcing a suitable rig for the workover of K-21 and K-28 wells which is planned to be conducted in the later part this year. The production from these two wells is anticipated to begin in 2024.Additionally, a 3D seismic program at Kruh Block, including data acquisition, processing and interpretation will be conducted in early 2024. The result of this seismic program is expected to help IEC estimate the size and potential of new oil and gas reservoirs and upgrade some of the unproved reserves to the proved category.IEC believes that this new work at Kruh Block, together with what has been learned from the 2022 oil and gas discoveries, is greatly assisting IEC in ascertaining the best locations to conduct its continuous drilling campaign at Kruh Block that will look to develop not only the one formation currently being targeted, but also look to develop what appears to be at least three additional oil formations that could contain significant commercial quantities of oil and natural gas. After completion and full interpretation of this seismic operations, IEC plans to re-start its continuous drilling campaign at Kruh Block in 2024. IEC still plans on drilling a total of 18 new wells at Kruh Block (4 of which have already been completed), by the end of 2026.Story continuesAt the same time, on IEC’s million-acre Citarum Block, IEC expects to receive the environmental permit for two-dimensional seismic data acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2023, which would allow IEC to begin the data acquisition work in the first quarter of 2024.Mr. Frank Ingriselli, IEC\'s President, commented "We are very excited about our Kruh Block contract extension and the significantly improved terms, where we get a significantly larger piece of all the oil produced which, in turn, drives improved reserves and potential future cash flows. All of this bodes well for our company as we look to recommence drilling at Kruh Block in 2024 with the benefit of information from our 2023 exploration activities. We continue to believe that Kruh Block is a world class asset and, in order to maximize future production capability, the seismic operations planned across the entire Kruh Block should positively leverage what we have learned from our previous discoveries, including our 2022 gas discovery, and determine the best locations to re-start our continuous drilling campaign. Additionally, we have now also moved forward with activities at our potential billion-barrel equivalent natural gas 1,000,000-acre Citarum Block, where the previous operator drilled a few gas discoveries. In short, we’ve never been more excited about IEC’s potential, and we look forward to continuing our efforts as we seek to drive positive shareholder value."About Indonesia Energy Corporation LimitedIndonesia Energy Corporation Limited (NYSE American: INDO) is a publicly traded energy company engaged in the acquisition and development of strategic, high growth energy projects in Indonesia.

                "Indonesia, a country that continues to be heavily dependent on coal, has just announced a major investment in a renewable energy plan, marking an important shift. The funding comes from global lenders and is expected to spur greater investment in Indonesia’s renewable energy sector, as well as support decarbonisation. However, the Asian country will require significantly more funding in the coming decades if it hopes to undergo a meaningful transformation.This month, the Indonesian government announced a new investment plan that will provide $20 billion in funding from global lenders to develop its renewable energy resources. The Comprehensive Investment and Policy Plan (CIPP) is led by the United States and Japan. Indonesia's Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) outlines the aim of cutting grid emissions to 250 million metric tonnes of CO2 by 2030, compared to the previous estimate of over 350 million.Using the funding to support decarbonisation aims, Indonesia now hopes to increase the contribution of renewable energy to the total energy mix to 44 percent by 2030, from just 12 percent in 2022. Erick Thohir, the ad-interim chief minister for investment affairs, stated, “We have to move quickly because 2030 is less than seven years away. The partnership must be enhanced and accelerated to do the priority projects, including to immediately realise the financing commitments.”Indonesia continues to rely heavily on coal, with around 60 percent of the country's electricity coming from the fossil fuel. While much of the world is moving away from coal, in favour of less-polluting natural gas or renewable alternatives, Indonesia is one of several Asian countries that expects to continue to use coal for years to come. Indonesia is the world's largest exporter of coal for electricity, having built more coal plants than it knows what to do with in recent decades due to misguided national energy demand projections.Before discussions of the CIPP commenced, Indonesia’s President Joko Widodo committed to stop constructing new coal plants. However, the CIPP includes an exemption to building new coal plants if they are already in the pipeline or attached to national development projects. This potential loophole could allow Indonesia to continue expanding its coal capacity while claiming to support a green transition.In September, Indonesia’s state utility, Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN), said the country would require around $172 billion in funding by 2040 for renewable energy projects and improvements to the grid to add 60GW of new renewable capacity. This includes a $5 billion investment for developing a smart grid, which would support the delivery of variable green energy such as wind and solar power. PLN is aiming to add 32GW of new capacity as a base load, as well as construct new grids to connect an additional 28 GW of renewable power as a variable load.Story continuesEvy Haryadi, the director of PLN, explained, “There is no transition without transmission. That is the first challenge, how we transmit power from the fairly remote location to the demand.” Meanwhile, the CEO of the company, Darmawan Prasodjo, stated, “With this accelerated renewable energy development, 75 percent of our additional generation capacity will be based on renewables and 25 percent will be gas-based.”While the $20 billion in funding is unlikely to contribute to a complete transformation of Indonesia’s energy sector, it is expected to help the Southeast Asian state get on the road to decarbonisation and attract more funding to the sector. However, some have criticised the CIPP for providing market-rate loans rather than special financing schemes, which will lead to high costs for Indonesia and could deter other countries from accepting similar deals in the future.In October 2022, the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) published its Indonesia Energy Transition Outlook to encourage investors to finance the country’s green transition. It suggested that because Indonesia is the highest energy consumer among the Member States of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) it is key to the global energy transition, particularly as its economy and population are expected to grow significantly over the next few decades.

                'indonesia  a country that continues to be heavily dependent on coal  has just announced a major investment in a renewable energy plan  marking an important shift  the funding comes from global lenders and is expected to spur greater investment in indonesia s renewable energy sector  as well as support decarbonisation  however  the asian country will require significantly more funding in the coming decades if it hopes to undergo a meaningful transformation this month  the indonesian government announced a new investment plan that will provide  20 billion in funding from global lenders to develop its renewable energy resources  the comprehensive investment and policy plan  cipp  is led by the united states and japan  indonesia s just energy transition partnership  jetp  outlines the aim of cutting grid emissions to 250 million metric tonnes of co2 by 2030  compared to the previous estimate of over 350 million using the funding to support decarbonisation aims  indonesia now hopes to increase the contribution of renewable energy to the total energy mix to 44 percent by 2030  from just 12 percent in 2022  erick thohir  the ad interim chief minister for investment affairs  stated   we have to move quickly because 2030 is less than seven years away  the partnership must be enhanced and accelerated to do the priority projects  including to immediately realise the financing commitments  indonesia continues to rely heavily on coal  with around 60 percent of the country s electricity coming from the fossil fuel  while much of the world is moving away from coal  in favour of less polluting natural gas or renewable alternatives  indonesia is one of several asian countries that expects to continue to use coal for years to come  indonesia is the world s largest exporter of coal for electricity  having built more coal plants than it knows what to do with in recent decades due to misguided national energy demand projections before discussions of the cipp commenced  indonesia s president joko widodo committed to stop constructing new coal plants  however  the cipp includes an exemption to building new coal plants if they are already in the pipeline or attached to national development projects  this potential loophole could allow indonesia to continue expanding its coal capacity while claiming to support a green transition in september  indonesia s state utility  perusahaan listrik negara  pln   said the country would require around  172 billion in funding by 2040 for renewable energy projects and improvements to the grid to add 60gw of new renewable capacity  this includes a  5 billion investment for developing a smart grid  which would support the delivery of variable green energy such as wind and solar power  pln is aiming to add 32gw of new capacity as a base load  as well as construct new grids to connect an additional 28 gw of renewable power as a variable load story continuesevy haryadi  the director of pln  explained   there is no transition without transmission  that is the first challenge  how we transmit power from the fairly remote location to the demand   meanwhile  the ceo of the company  darmawan prasodjo  stated   with this accelerated renewable energy development  75 percent of our additional generation capacity will be based on renewables and 25 percent will be gas based  while the  20 billion in funding is unlikely to contribute to a complete transformation of indonesia s energy sector  it is expected to help the southeast asian state get on the road to decarbonisation and attract more funding to the sector  however  some have criticised the cipp for providing market rate loans rather than special financing schemes  which will lead to high costs for indonesia and could deter other countries from accepting similar deals in the future in october 2022  the international renewable energy agency  irena  published its indonesia energy transition outlook to encourage investors to finance the country s green transition  it suggested that because indonesia is the highest energy consumer among the member states of the association of southeast asian nations  asean  it is key to the global energy transition  particularly as its economy and population are expected to grow significantly over the next few decades  indonesia has a wide supply of renewable resources and the opportunity to tap into its green potential so long as it can attract higher levels of funding the cipp is expected to provide indonesia with the initial funding needed to kick start its green transformation  the southeast asian country has an abundant supply of renewable resources and the potential to become a major supplier of clean energy in the region  however  to achieve this  the government must follow through on its pledge to halt the construction of any new coal plants in favour of green alternatives by felicity bradstock for oilprice commore top reads from oilprice com top

A copy of the same can be downloaded here. During the quarter the strategy returned 17.6% net of fees compared to the S&P 500’s 11.7% return. The portfolio\'s outperformance can be attributed to a three-factor model, where interaction, selection, and allocation effects all played a significant role. In addition, you can check the top 5 holdings of the fund to know its best picks in 2023.Patient Capital Management featured stocks such as K Kosmos Energy Ltd. (NYSE:KOS) in the fourth quarter 2023 investor letter. Headquartered in Dallas, Texas, Kosmos Energy Ltd. (NYSE:KOS) explores and produces oil and gas properties along the Atlantic Margins. On January 30, 2024, Kosmos Energy Ltd. (NYSE:KOS) stock closed at $6.36 per share. One-month return of Kosmos Energy Ltd. (NYSE:KOS) was -7.42%, and its shares lost 18.25% of their value over the last 52 weeks. Kosmos Energy Ltd. (NYSE:KOS) has a market capitalization of $2.926 billion.Patient Capital Management stated the following regarding Kosmos Energy Ltd. (NYSE:KOS) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:"Kosmos Energy Ltd. (NYSE:KOS) declined from the high seen at the end of September following energy prices lower. The company was also hit as they marginally increased CAPEX expectations and hinted at the potential for their first gas delivery out of Tortue being delayed to 2Q24 from 1Q. Kosmos is an exploration and production services company with assets in Africa. The company is differentiated in the Exploration & Production space because of its growth profile (+30% YoY in 2024), long reserve life (>20yrs, nearly double the sector average) and focus on liquified natural gas (LNG). While the market is focused on near-term risk of production delays, we believe it is ignoring the long-term value of the underlying assets. As we move into 2024, production should inflect higher, climbing 30% YoY, while CAPEX comes down, declining 20% YoY. Together this leads to attractive growth and free cash flow generating asset providing the company the ability to pay down their debt and to return capital. At these levels, the company will generate more than its current market cap in FCF over the next 5 years at $90 Brent prices. With the combination of gas-heavy reserves and inflecting cash flow generation, we think Kosmos is significantly undervalued and a potential acquisition target."A drilling platform in the middle of the ocean, showing the oil and gas exploration process.Story continuesKosmos Energy Ltd.

                'Industry watchers expect 2024 to be a much stronger year for energy stocks for growth than 2023. Fidelity, for example, expects energy stocks to rebound due to limited supply, healthy demand, and increasing investment In production.2023 was a particularly weak year for energy stocks. By mid-December, the energy sector had fallen by 6.7% while the overall markets increased by nearly 20%.However, the energy sector showed some signs of vitality to end the year improving to an overall 1.3% decline in 2023. Granted, that wasn’t great, but far better than it was. Encouragingly, that uptick left investors searching for energy stocks for growth with the potential to double.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsVAALCO Energy (EGY)EGY StockVAALCO Energy (NYSE:EGY) Is a smaller exploration and production firm in the oil sector with an attractive stock. Shares trade for less than $4.50 and are rated a buy, with an average consensus target of $8.30. Thus, VAALCO Energy can double investor capital.EGY also yields 5.88% at the moment and is developing crude oil assets located In the West African nations of Gabon and Equatorial Guinea. From an operational standpoint, VAALCO Energy is doing well. 2023 production volumes reached between 18,700 and 18,800 barrels of oil equivalent per day. That was near the high end of the range from 18,300 to 18,900.Additionally, the company grew its cash equivalents to $120 million while returning $12.5 million to investors in the form of dividends and buybacks.Kosmos Energy (KOS)Large tanker ship carrying natural gas at dusk in harborSource: shutterstock.com/Wojciech WrzesienKosmos Energy (NYSE:KOS) Is another low-priced exploration and production firm in the oil sector. Like VAALCO Energy, it is a stock with assets in West Africa. The company engages in offshore production primarily in Ghana and Equatorial Guinea as well as in the Gulf of Mexico.Analysts expect KOS shares to rise by roughly 70% at the top end. It trades for $6.25 though so it isn’t out of the realm of possibility that it doubles.In addition, during the third quarter, the company produced 68,200 barrels of oil per day while selling 73,100. Production increased by 17% during the quarter with further increases expected at the time.Meanwhile, the company increased its working interest in the Yaakar Teranga gas discoveries off the coast of Senegal upon BP’s (NYSE:BP) exit.

The commitment is a set of goals that aspires to eliminate All occupational injuries and illnesses while removing environmental harm from its footprint.  While that’s very hard to measure, it remains a worthwhile goal.The company itself provides drilling services and the fact that it is expected to double is a reflection of demand therefore. Demand is going to drive share prices most in 2024 but it isn’t the only thing to understand about Precision Drilling.The company continues to reduce its debt as an overarching organizational goal. In 2023, the company reduced total debt by $152 million. That has served to reduce its net debt to EBITDA ratio to 1.5.

It’s very well established and currently has a price of around $155 per share.The high analyst target price of $240 suggests that FANG shares will have a difficult time doubling. However, Diamondback Energy does pay a fixed plus variable dividend that offers a lot of upside in the best of times. If share prices rise toward $240, the company will be doing well. That implies that the company will also be increasing its variable dividend at that time. Thus, a doubling of share prices is not out of the realm of possibility by any means.There’s other good news about the company aside from potential price upside. In the third quarter, oil and total production were both at the high end of guidance ranges. The company expects both of those metrics to increase in the fourth quarter with earnings due in early February.Halliburton (HAL)In the field, the oil pump in the evening, the evening silhouette of the pumping unit, the silhouette of the oil pump.

                "Datadog (NASDAQ: DDOG) attracted a stampede of bulls when it went public. The cloud-based software provider priced its initial public offering (IPO) at $27 on Sept. 19, 2019, and its stock opened at $40.35 before rallying to a record high of $196.56 on Nov. 9, 2021.At its peak, Datadog's market cap hit $61.3 billion -- or 36 times the revenue it would generate in 2022. But today, it trades at about $126 with a market cap of $41.8 billion -- which is just 16 times the revenue it's expected to generate in 2024.Image source: Getty Images.The bulls retreated as Datadog's growth cooled off and rising rates compressed its valuations, but it's still more than quadrupled from its IPO price. Could this niche cloud player eventually become a cloud titan like Microsoft?What does Datadog do?Datadog's platform monitors diagnostic data from an organization's cloud servers, databases, and applications in real time. It aggregates all of that information onto unified dashboards to help IT professionals to spot potential problems.From 2019 to 2022, Datadog's annual revenue had a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 67%. Its number of large customers, which generate over $100,000 in annual recurring revenue (ARR), more than tripled during those three years.But in 2023, Datadog's revenue only rose 27% to $2.13 billion as its number of large customers grew 15% to 2,780. For 2024, it expects its revenue to rise 20% to 21%. Analysts expect its revenue to grow at a CAGR of 25% from 2023 to 2026.Datadog blamed its recent slowdown on the macro headwinds, which drove many companies to scrutinize their spending on cloud-based applications. However, it still kept its net revenue retention rate around 115% over the past 12 months.As its revenue growth cooled off, it reined in its spending to stabilize its margins. From 2019 to 2023, its adjusted operating margin improved from negative 1.5% to positive 23%. It turned profitable on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis in 2023, and analysts expect its GAAP net income to grow at a CAGR of 58% from 2023 to 2026.Datadog is still growing, but its market is maturing. The global observability tools and platform market could only expand at a CAGR of 11.7% from 2023 to 2028, according to Markets and Markets, and it's already saturated with similar services like Cisco Systems' AppDynamics and Splunk, Dynatrace, New Relic, LogicMonitor, Microsoft's Azure Monitor, and IBM's Instana.Could Datadog become the next Microsoft?Today's Datadog is comparable to Microsoft back in fiscal 1992 (which ended in June 1992), when the future tech giant only generated $2.8 billion in revenue. From fiscal 1992 to fiscal 2023, its revenue grew at a CAGR of 15% to $211.9 billion.Story continuesTo maintain a CAGR of 15% for more than three decades, Microsoft dominated the PC operating system and productivity software markets, transformed its desktop software into mobile and cloud-based apps, expanded its own cloud infrastructure platform, grew its Xbox gaming business through acquisitions, and made some big investments in the AI market.The saturation of the observability market could make it tough for Datadog to generate comparable revenue growth over the next three decades. Datadog has expanded its ecosystem with a few acquisitions, but it doesn't seem interested in evolving into a consumer-facing cloud, mobile, artificial intelligence (AI), gaming, and hardware company like Microsoft.Instead, Datadog should continue to operate behind the scenes and help companies closely monitor their cloud-based applications. That niche focus suggests it's far more likely to be acquired -- just as AppDynamics, Splunk, and NewRelic were in recent years -- instead of staying independent and evolving into a tech titan like Microsoft.Should you invest $1,000 in Datadog right now?Before you buy stock in Datadog, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Datadog wasn’t one of them.

Older millennials – and even younger ones – should be quite familiar with the gaming console brand. Indeed, the company before the Covid-19 pandemic changed everything has been banking on the magic of nostalgia marketing.It sounds silly today with downloaded games and the burgeoning ecosystem of esports. However, back during Nintendo’s heyday, people were very much tethered to the physical realm. When games didn’t work quite right, you would have to take the gaming cartridge out and blow on it to remove the dust. Again, it sounds ridiculous but that’s how kids rolled during that era.Still, that “tactile” memory may have further evoked nostalgic emotions, making NTDOY a surprisingly solid idea for toy stocks. Analysts rate shares a consensus moderate buy although they’re hesitant to list a price target.

MAT stock.Source: Ken Wolter / ShutterstockOne of the top toy manufacturers in the world, Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT) has a new client base: fully grown adults. You see, Mattel owns the popular Hot Wheels brand of toy cars. At some point, practically every kid owned one of the pint-sized vehicles. However, most of us were not fortunate enough to be born to super-rich or super-indulgent parents. So, we made do with what we had.Several years down the line, however, the current adults still harken back to their childhood days. Not only that, many of them have become avid collectors of rate Hot Wheels. Some sets are worth the price of exotic road cars (as in, the real kind). With the nostalgia market running sky high these days, MAT could be an intriguing idea for toy stocks.Story continuesEven better, shares appear to be undervalued, trading at only 13.64X forward earnings.

                "Veteran player in the video game arena Nintendo (OTC: NTDOY) scored a few points on the stock exchange Monday. The Japan-based company saw its U.S.-listed shares rise by 2% following an analyst's reiteration of his buy recommendation on the stock.That bump was more than good enough to top the performance of the weakening S&P 500 index, which decreased by 0.4% on the day.Nintendo stock is a buy, insists Bernstein analystBefore the U.S. stock markets opened, Bernstein's Robin Zhu once again tagged Nintendo as an outperform (buy, in other words) at a price target of 9,500 yen ($63.11) per share. The video game company's most recent closing share price on its native exchange was 8,549 ($56.79), for a potential 11% upside.The reasons for Zhu's reiteration weren't immediately clear. Perhaps it's not coincidental that it came the same day that Nikkei Asia's website reported that Nintendo aims to delay the rollout of a new version of its durably popular Switch handheld console. According to the financial news outlet, the company will launch it in March 2025 at the earliest.Many pundits had expected Nintendo to begin shipping the device this year. According to Nikkei Asia's reporting, however, the company has elected to give more time for developers to create new games for it.Nintendo has not yet officially commented on the article.Slow and steady wins the raceThe history of global business is littered with stories of impatient companies that rushed promising goods or services to market, and got burned for doing so. Nintendo's hardware releases have generally been well-received and ultimately successful, especially in the case of the storied Switch, so we can have every confidence its reasons for the apparent delay are sound.Should you invest $1,000 in Nintendo right now?Before you buy stock in Nintendo, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nintendo wasn’t one of them.
