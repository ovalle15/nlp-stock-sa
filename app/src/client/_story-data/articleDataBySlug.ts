Older millennials – and even younger ones – should be quite familiar with the gaming console brand. Indeed, the company before the Covid-19 pandemic changed everything has been banking on the magic of nostalgia marketing.It sounds silly today with downloaded games and the burgeoning ecosystem of esports. However, back during Nintendo’s heyday, people were very much tethered to the physical realm. When games didn’t work quite right, you would have to take the gaming cartridge out and blow on it to remove the dust. Again, it sounds ridiculous but that’s how kids rolled during that era.Still, that “tactile” memory may have further evoked nostalgic emotions, making NTDOY a surprisingly solid idea for toy stocks.

MAT stock.Source: Ken Wolter / ShutterstockOne of the top toy manufacturers in the world, Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT) has a new client base: fully grown adults. You see, Mattel owns the popular Hot Wheels brand of toy cars. At some point, practically every kid owned one of the pint-sized vehicles. However, most of us were not fortunate enough to be born to super-rich or super-indulgent parents. So, we made do with what we had.Several years down the line, however, the current adults still harken back to their childhood days. Not only that, many of them have become avid collectors of rate Hot Wheels. Some sets are worth the price of exotic road cars (as in, the real kind). With the nostalgia market running sky high these days, MAT could be an intriguing idea for toy stocks.Story continuesEven better, shares appear to be undervalued, trading at only 13.64X forward earnings. That’s lower than the sector median 16X.

At first, the concept of fully grown human beings buying toys for themselves struck me as bizarre. But then, I remembered the Star Wars franchise and the fandom tied to it.Who makes Star Wars toys?

                    "Veteran player in the video game arena Nintendo (OTC: NTDOY) scored a few points on the stock exchange Monday. The Japan-based company saw its U.S.-listed shares rise by 2% following an analyst's reiteration of his buy recommendation on the stock.That bump was more than good enough to top the performance of the weakening S&P 500 index, which decreased by 0.4% on the day.Nintendo stock is a buy, insists Bernstein analystBefore the U.S. stock markets opened, Bernstein's Robin Zhu once again tagged Nintendo as an outperform (buy, in other words) at a price target of 9,500 yen ($63.11) per share. The video game company's most recent closing share price on its native exchange was 8,549 ($56.79), for a potential 11% upside.The reasons for Zhu's reiteration weren't immediately clear. Perhaps it's not coincidental that it came the same day that Nikkei Asia's website reported that Nintendo aims to delay the rollout of a new version of its durably popular Switch handheld console. According to the financial news outlet, the company will launch it in March 2025 at the earliest.Many pundits had expected Nintendo to begin shipping the device this year. According to Nikkei Asia's reporting, however, the company has elected to give more time for developers to create new games for it.Nintendo has not yet officially commented on the article.Slow and steady wins the raceThe history of global business is littered with stories of impatient companies that rushed promising goods or services to market, and got burned for doing so. Nintendo's hardware releases have generally been well-received and ultimately successful, especially in the case of the storied Switch, so we can have every confidence its reasons for the apparent delay are sound.Should you invest $1,000 in Nintendo right now?Before you buy stock in Nintendo, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nintendo wasn’t one of them.

The announcement drove shares of DeNA, which had slumped to a three-and-a-half-year low, up a record 24.4% on Wednesday.The smartphone game was one of a flurry of announcements on the 28th anniversary of the first Pokémon game release. Pokémon’s international arm separately posted a two-minute teaser of its next title for Nintendo Co.’s Switch console, Pokémon Legends: Z-A.The trailer, which features a computer-generated Pikachu running through Lumiose City, snagged 9.6 million views within hours of being posted. The game is slated for release worldwide in 2025, the trailer said.Nintendo previously told its game-publishing partners the company was pushing back the launch of its Switch successor to the beginning of next year, from a widely-expected launch this year.
