                        "One simple way to benefit from the stock market is to buy an index fund. But if you pick the right individual stocks, you could make more than that. Just take a look at Kosmos Energy Ltd. (NYSE:KOS), which is up 82%, over three years, soundly beating the market return of 15% (not including dividends).While the stock has fallen 7.5% this week, it's worth focusing on the longer term and seeing if the stocks historical returns have been driven by the underlying fundamentals. See our latest analysis for Kosmos Energy In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Kosmos Energy became profitable within the last three years. That would generally be considered a positive, so we'd expect the share price to be up.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Kosmos Energy has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? You can see how its balance sheet has strengthened (or weakened) over time in this free interactive graphic.A Different PerspectiveInvestors in Kosmos Energy had a tough year, with a total loss of 8.2%, against a market gain of about 28%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 0.5% per year over five years. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Even so, be aware that  Kosmos Energy is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis , you should know about...Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question and answer session will follow the formal presentation. If anyone should require operator assistance during the conference, please press star and zero on your telephone keypad. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Jamie Buckland, VP, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.Jamie BucklandThank you, operator, and thanks to everyone for joining us today this morning, we issued our first quarter 2024 earnings release. This release and the slide presentation to accompany today's call are available on the Investors page of our website. Joining me on the call today. To go through the materials are Andy Inglis, Chairman and CEO, and Neal Shah, CFO. During today's presentation, we will make forward-looking statements that refer to our estimates, plans and expectations. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially due to factors we note in the presentation and in our UK and SEC filings, please refer to our annual report, stock exchange announcement and SEC filings for more details. These documents are available on our website. And at this time, I'll turn the call over to Andy.Andrew InglisThanks, Jamie, and good morning and afternoon. To everyone. Thank you for joining us today for our first quarter results call. It's been an active start to the year for Cosmos, and I'll start today's presentation. Looking at the operational and financial momentum we've built in the first few months of the year. Neil will then walk you through this quarter's financial results before I look ahead to the catalysts for the remainder of the year. We'll then open up the call for Q&A. Starting on Slide 3, with the delivery of our major projects, COSMOS had a strong first quarter with significant progress towards our goal of growing production by around 50% from the second half of 2022 to the end of 2024. In Ghana, all the planned 2020 for Jubilee production wells are online with one water injection well expected online later this quarter. Following completion of this well, the planned drilling campaign will conclude approximately six months ahead of schedule as a result of efficiencies in the drilling operations in the Gulf of Mexico. Oil production of Windsor 12 is expected to begin shortly from the initial two wells. Our third well is due to come online later this year, increasing our expected gross production to around 20,000 barrels of oil per day in Mauritania and Senegal. The Tortue project continues to move towards first gas with several key milestones achieved already this year. I'll talk more about our progress on these projects later in the presentation. Looking further ahead, we continue to advance our next phase of growth projects. Long lead items are being secured for time, various to optimize the development time line and project costs. We have also secured a two year license extension for Yakaar Teranga, while we see continued growth as an important part of the Company's future, as I said last quarter, it will be selective and more measured in the coming years, consistent with sustained annual CapEx of around $550 million per year. That is targeted from 2025 onwards. On the financial side of the business we enhanced the Company's financial resilience with the convertible bond issuance and the RBL refinancing. Neil will talk about these in more detail shortly. The transactions improved liquidity and extended our near-term maturities. The free cash flow inflection point we've been anticipating of around $100 million to $150 million per quarter once our development projects come online is now only a few months away. I'll now talk through the operational progress across our different business units, starting in Ghana on Slide 4. Jubilee production in the first quarter was around 93,000 barrels of oil per day growth, almost 30% higher than the first quarter last year. This reflects the progress made from both the startup of the Jubilee Southeast project and the ongoing infill drilling program. Jubilee FPSO reliability continues to remain high at approximately 99% uptime for the first quarter. Moody's replacement was also strong in the quarter, around 110% as a result of high levels of water and gas injection gross Jubilee gas sales for the quarter was around 16,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Recently, the partnership agreed an 18 month extension to the Jubilee gas sales agreement for approximately $3 per MMBTU. in the second quarter. There is some planned maintenance of the onshore plant, which receives the Jubilee gas. And this is reflected in the 2Q 2Q guidance on 10 gross production at 18,600 barrels of oil per day was in line with expectations with high FPSO uptime of around 99%, similar to Jubilee. Turning to Slide 5. Production in the Gulf of Mexico for the quarter was approximately 14,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day net in line with guidance at Windsor file, where Kosmos has a 25% working interest. First oil from the two initial wells is expected shortly with another well expected online in the second half of the year. Gross production when all three wells were online is expected to be around 20,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We estimate total gross resource across greater wind fell about 200 million barrels of oil equivalent, providing significant future follow-on potential to enhance existing production. We continue to invest selectively in high return projects like the old job, subsea pump and Kodiak workover both expected to finish around the middle of the year. The combined uplift from both of these projects is expected to contribute around 5,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Net Cosmos is year end exit rate. The tornado field is expected to be offline for most of the second quarter for scheduled routine maintenance of the HP. one floating production unit, which has been factored into our guidance for the quarter on type areas where Cosmos is, operator, we acquired part of Ecuador's interest during the first quarter to maintain an aligned partnership. We now hold a 50% interest in the project, which is already included in our 2024 capital guidance. This phased developments as subsea tieback to Oxy's nearby Lucius platform is progressing. Project sanction expected later in the year. Certain long-lead items have been secured to optimize the development time line and project costs around the time of project sanction. Cosmos plans to farm down to optimize our working interest to fit within our targeted capital program for 2025 and beyond. Please turn to Slide 6. Production in Equatorial Guinea averaged approximately 24,400 barrels of oil per day gross and 8,400 net in the first quarter. Cosmos lifted one cargo from actual Guinea during the quarter, in line with guidance in early February. As previously communicated, the operator pause, the Sabra and the two main drilling campaign as a result of safety issues with the previous rig, the partnership has now secured the Noble venture to resume the drilling campaign with a rig expected on-location midyear. The rig is scheduled to drill and complete two infill wells in Block G before moving to drill the King deep ILX prospects in block hours new infill wells are expected to add around 3,000 barrels of oil per day net to Kosmos at year end exit rate. The result of the King deep well, which is targeting gross resource of around 180 million barrels is expected around the end of the year. Turning to slide 7, the Greater Tortue acumen project continues to move towards first gas with significant progress across all work streams so far this year with first gas expected in the third quarter and first LNG expected in the fourth quarter. Floating LNG vessel arrived in the first quarter as being more to the hub terminal. The partnership is now working with the vessel operator to accelerate commissioning. The subsea work is progressing in line with expectations with a flowline installation complete and final connection work. Ongoing inspection and repair of the FDSO. fairly is now complete and the vessel has left Tenerife and his own route to the project site. Good morning work to commence thereafter. Hookup and commissioning of the FPSO remains on the critical path. First gas, which is expected in the first quarter I'll now turn it over to Neil to take you through the financials.Story continuesNealesh ShahThanks, Andy. Turning to Slide 8, which looks at the first quarter production in the quarter of approximately 66,700 barrels of oil equivalent per day net was an increase of around 13% compared to the same quarter last year. Costs for the quarter were within or slightly better than guidance leading to the earnings beat against consensus. Capex for the first quarter was $286 million, which was in line with guidance and is largely made up of the Ghana drilling campaign and the progress made on both winter fell and on Tortue. As previously communicated, we expect the majority of this year's CapEx be in the first half of this year with the free cash flow inflection that Andy talked about in his opening slide expected as the development projects complete and production ramps up throughout the end of the year. Turning to Slide 9, which looks at our debt maturities, we took two important steps this year to further enhance the financial resilience of the company. First was the convertible bond issuance in March, which proactively replaces the liquidity from the $250 million undrawn RCF is due to expire at the end of this year. The convertible also lowered our overall interest expense as we paid down a portion of our RBL with the available proceeds, which is our highest cost debt. We've also seen the yields on our high-yield bonds tightened, which should help pricing when we come to think about potentially refinancing those in the future to limit future equity dilution. We purchased a capped call, which means there will be no dilution until the shares get to almost $11 per share. We also took the option to cash settle the principal amount raised, which also reduces any future dilution second important step was the refinancing of our reserve-based lending facility with in terms of broadly in line with the previous facility. The overall facility size increased to $1.35 billion from $1.25 billion with current commitments of around $1.2 billion through the refinancing, we have extended the final maturity by approximately three years at the same time, we have had some of our banks transfer their commitment to the RBL from the RCF, which, as I mentioned, expires at the end of this year. I'd like to thank our banks for their continued support as we continue to grow the Company. The chart on the right shows the impact of both the convertible bond issuance and the RBL refinancing on the maturity schedule. We now have no near term debt and the staggered maturity schedule from 2026 onwards as we reach the expected free cash flow inflection point plan to continue to prioritize paying down the RBL, reducing the amounts in the dark blue. On the chart on the right, we continue to target leverage below 1.5 times at mid-cycle oil prices with deleveraging expected minutes once revenues from Ford to start up later in the year. With that, I'll hand it back to Andy to conclude today's presentation.Andrew InglisTurning now to Slide 10. As I said in my opening remarks, it was a busy first quarter and we have achieved a lot in just three months. The operational financial momentum we built has rolled into the second quarter with several milestones already achieved and more to come in the near future. The graphic on this slide shows a rich portfolio of catalysts throughout the year across all our business units, they contribute towards our goal for year-end exit rate of 90,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Net free cash flow inflection points combined, we believe these will create significant value for our shareholders. Thank you, and I'd now like to turn the call over to the operator to open the session questions.Question and Answer SessionOperatorThank you, ladies and gentlemen, we will now be conducting a question and answer session. If you'd like to ask a question, please press star and one on your telephone keypad. A confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. You may press star and two if you'd like to remove your question from the queue For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys. Ladies and gentlemen, we will wait for a moment while poll for questions. Our first question is from the line of David Round with Stifel. Please go ahead.David RoundThanks. Thanks for the presentation, guys. Just two questions from me, please. Firstly, can I just ask about Senegal, please? And whether the following the recent elections that you've seen any impact at all to business activities in country, and there's been quite a lot in the press, so I'd appreciate any comments there, please. Secondly, just some on Equatorial Guinea. Obviously good to see activity there again, that's obviously been a great asset from memory. That was quite a big in-place number there with a relatively modest recovery factor so far. I'm just wondering, could that become a bigger, an area of activity going forward once you see CapEx elsewhere? Drop off?Andrew InglisYes, David, yes, thanks to both of those are picked them up? I think, you know, turning to Senegal first, I think the starting point is really is that elections in our host countries and our new for Cosmos and our ethos is to align with the countries and their needs irrespective of changes of government. I think in Senegal, our approach is no different where we're enabling the development of low cost gas to sustainably grow the Senegalese economy and drive social progress for the country. So there's a high degree of alignment between what we're doing and the new government's objectives which are clear, they want to lower the cost of living for its population and improve the improve economic environment. I think it's early days for the new administration. There are many officials still to be appointed. But my team in Santiago have have met with the new energy and mining minister. And I'm pleased to say it was a very constructive dialogue. You know that the conversation centered around actually how can we accelerate the development of the gas resources to accelerate the the benefits to the country. So, you know, in terms of the day-to-day. I know our business center goes unchanged. We're working to bring Phase one online later this year. It moved forward with a capital efficient Phase two, the expansion of Phase one that will enhance the revenues to the states and the partners and then move forward with a domestic gas LNG export scheme and YT., all of which will bring economic and social benefits for the country. So I do think is a real basis for a win-win. And I'm pleased to say that we're actually in a constructive dialogue as to how we shape that shape that agenda. And on Equatorial Guinea, I think you're correct to say that there's actually a lot of undeveloped resource. And when we initially took over the asset, it was it was about enhancing the production from essentially sort of workover activities. If you remember, I think it was, you know, we talked about it being gas-lift constrained. So we actually move to ESPs, and we've seen the benefit of that activity. We're now moving, I think, into a different phase, which is about infill drilling, which is this the current campaign as you rightly say we're targeting an infill well in cyber and one in the queue May and then actually we're following it up with the King deal, which is a test a deeper test of the Albian. And clearly, if it if that comes in, we've got a significant amount of knowledge in the room in the facilities to bring that on and very short tieback distances. So I think we've got sort of, you know, two avenues and what we would see for per se. But it to me is a and an intermittent at the infill drilling campaign, we know two or three wells every sort of 18 months, something like that where I think you can certainly sustain the production profile. All of that CapEx is is in the forward forecast of maintenance of the base. And then, you know, with a king, do you think you've got the ability to actually grow the profile? So I think we've got a clear plan about sustaining the profile in actual G&A through that infill drilling with, I think still some some sort of workover type activities growth coming. If you had success I Kingdee. So I think you know, it's been a really good acquisition. I think we worked really well too on now go through a very programmatic program to target the video, the quick wins, which were really around so the workover activities. And now we're moving into a more phased approach with the with infill. But there's plenty to go out here and clearly having the capacity in the facilities, it enables us to move it forward quickly.David RoundThanks, Andy.Andrew InglisThanks, David.OperatorThank you. Our next question is from the line of Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.Charles MeadeI'm sure you're probably more excited than we are to see that, that FPSO underway. And so congratulations for that. But wondering if you can take us through just the highlights or what the next pieces or pieces of the puzzle or milestones are to get to first gas. I imagine that that's some pieces. It would be getting the getting the FPSO more broken up the risers, introducing the gas the FLG. and then go into the whole FLNG cool down, but maybe you can elaborate that or add pieces to it that we should be on the lookout for?Andrew InglisI love questions whether you've already answered the question, Joe, sorry about that. And I think you've got it. I think, Jim, clearly, I think we've had a lot of progress in the in this sort of first four months of the year. We've got the FLNG vessel now at the hub terminal. It's more than the and the connection work is ongoing. The last piece of equipment arrived to the FPSO, which you said it will be on location in the matter of few days. The next step then is the is morning and while some borrowings, then we start to work on the top signs in terms of the commissioning work and the hookup of the rise is clearly the step that enables a gas to be introduced. And then it's a question of the gas. As you say, coming into the FLNG vessel, you start to cool down process and then you start to make FLNG first cargo, et cetera. So I think the as you look through that process, you described an arena really well, where are we with the subsea equipment, all the major pieces of that are now doing the final tie-ins and that work is proceeding as we envisage. So we're pleased with the progress there. The FPSO work, the hookup and commissioning of the FPSO remains on the critical path, but clearly, getting the vessel on location has enabled us to start to liquidate that activity. So I think, you know, you were well on track to do what we said we were going to do and the milestones have been achieved so far this year. So getting the FPSO on location is clearly an important step. And then we'll update you next quarter as we now get that work behind us and hopefully, you know, with the completion of the riser hookup and then the I which will then allow us to start flowing gas.Charles MeadeGot it. And then the follow-up, I wonder if you could you could add some some detail and context around the rollout exploration. I'm wondering if this is kind of along the lines of how Yakaar Teranga played out in that BP., maybe it didn't want to be involved, but you guys are still you guys still have some some plans and you just tell us what's going on and a good.Andrew InglisYes, good question, Charles. I think that you're going to be sort of step back. It was sort of some, you know, repeating the both YT. Ambarella will scale discovered gas resources, you know, sort of in-place numbers. I think a YG. 25 Tcf per outlet probably around 30 Tcf and we believe it is advantaged gas. It has negligible CO2 and it's close to your home. So with BP no longer on either license, we can now work independently with the NOCs of both countries on innovative cost efficient schemes that BP didn't propose, but we believe will lead to attractive returns for both the project partners and the government we've secured the license on YT. We've secured the extension to allow us to proceed with that work. And then we're in discussions with the with the Mauritanian government around how we can help them progress the development brand that they're keen to move it forward. And we believe we have both the subsurface knowledge and the concept that will enable it to be an attractive project. So I think that's where we are. And there's been a lot of third-party interest in the assets as well. So we believe that actually working both with Patterson on YT. and SMH. umbrella. We're trying to create an equal partnership where they're properly represented, which we believe is actually a good thing. Clearly for both government and we're working with them to find ways to bring in a partner that will enable the development to move forward. So I think you characterized it correctly, and we're energized to work on that agenda.Charles MeadeGreat. Thanks for the detail.Andrew InglisGreat. Thanks, Charles.OperatorAnd thank you. Our next question is from the line of Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research. Please go ahead.Bob BrackettGood morning, Charles de stole most of my thunder, so let me tried to it a lot. The Tortue FPSO, so that vessel's been expected by the operator by you all passed muster and so it is ready to go.Andrew InglisYes, you know, as with all things, Bob, you know, as it were because of having to do the work on the fairly it is a blessing that it does allow us to what we had additional sort of three months and generated close to three months in January to further progress the topsides work. So I think we understand the scope very well. And I think you're right to sort of push the question around FPSOs has sailed in the past with a lot of work to come to execute. So I think we've got a good understanding of what the work scope is clearly and therefore, clear plans on how to execute that work scope. So yes, I feel good about that and nothing's done until it's done. But clearly, we do have, I think, the advantages of having extra time to work on the on the topsides as a result of the time on the on the fairly it's very clear.Bob BrackettThe follow-up. Good comes back to bear. All of the PSC had been extended for two years view and the government and BP had been working in good faith to kind of push that project along the clock ran out. How do we think about whether you are the natural owner of a partnership that brings that asset to market or does it go to a competitive bid where you're in line with one of many and I'm intrigued by what you think the concept could be for fast track development there?Andrew InglisYes. No, yes. Interesting, Bob. I think that, you know, the government is actually trying to find a way of moving the project forward in a constructive way. And what do I mean by that? Actually they could go out to the market with bids, et cetera. Would you have clearly the the negative of that is that it creates an uncertain partnership. You know, you're on bringing potentially somebody new that doesn't have the subsurface knowledge that we have. We believe there is a genuine desire to trial and work with existing partners who have the knowledge and, you know, we've probably, you know, we bring the knowledge of and two wells in Barilla one, I'm assume one on Orca, we bring the knowledge of all the appraisal wells on GCA and the development wells on GTA and then the calibration of the seismic against against that dataset. So there's significant knowledge, I believe that we bring in terms of the development concept, it's really about how do you get cost efficient in terms of the subsea layout. And ultimately, that's where we've seen the big cost increases in the industry is in the is in the subsea. So minimizing that architecture. You minimize that actually by putting the FLNG vessel directly out of the field that has the additional benefit of lowering the pressure drops, which gives you enhanced recovery. So those, you know, without going into engineering in too much detail, but those are the those are the ways in which you can change the cost basis of the development. And those are the concepts are working on and why TI and those are the concepts we're bringing to bear to bear our very clear. Thank you.Bob BrackettGreat. Thank you.Nealesh ShahThanks, Bob.OperatorThank you. Our next question is from Matthew Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead.Matthew SmithHey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions and a couple, please. And the first one was just And apologies if I missed some of the commentary around this at the start of the call. But any additional color you could give us on the performance of <unk> in Ghana, I guess at Jubilee, in particular in the quarter, just how that's fared versus your own expectations, what confidence that gives you in the full year outlook? Because you had an additional oil producer online in April? If you could sort of talk to that at all and sort of exit rates, what you've seen post the quarter, just to sort of frame how Ghana started the year off and the confidence that gives you for the rest of the year that that would be interesting to hear them yet. But perhaps I'll try and come back to the second.Andrew InglisOkay. Yes, thanks, Emma. I think sort of updating you sort of if you look across March and April, I think we averaged around 95,000 barrels of oil per day. So as you say, we brought on the recently just brought on the the final producer, and we're optimizing its setup in the subsea to maximize the benefits from that. And then finally, we've got the final water injection, which is currently being drilled and actually we're going to start the completion of that shortly. So I think the I think it's early days, you say as you look forward to the performance of the field over the remaining part of the year. I think those are the three fundamental things we're focusing on. You know, the first is the contribution of the recently added wells to the ramp up in rate on the second is we had really good reliability in the in the first quarter and that you're close to 99% on the Jubilee FPSO. Clearly we need to maintain that high level of reliability going forward. And then I think the third one is really the most important point is around maintaining the high levels of bodies replacement on that was that was a challenge last year where we had downtime and didn't get to 100% now. We sort of were pretty good in the first quarter and we need to sort of maintain that going forward. We have had a GTG. down, I think, for a couple of weeks. So we probably have been slightly under 100 temps and in the last month. But that is you know that that's a critical factor. So I think it's, you know, if those are the things where we're focusing on and therefore, those are the things that are going to influence the outcome across the rest of the year. All that said, the drilling has actually gone well. You know, we've firm. We've really drilled in other the operators and the great job on the drilling performance and the wells and the timing of the wells has absolutely met. You know, our our expectations. And you know, when the final water injection is done, I think over this program we probably created probably close to six months a reduction in the overall program, which is pretty impressive. And so that's sort of where we stand today, Matt, and that pivot.Matthew SmithThanks, Andy. That's really helpful. And perhaps the second one and perhaps would be for Neil. I imagine just coming back to the free cash flow sort of indication that you've given us $100 million to $150 million per quarter. And once the growth projects through our online. I think if I if I remember rightly, you talk to that sort of being underpinned broadly speaking by a $70 WTI, $75 Brent, are there please correct me if I ever mistaken there. But I just wondered if you could speak to sort of sensitivities and upside to those free cash flow numbers if we're in an $80 or $85 Brent world.Nealesh ShahYes, sure, Matt. And yes, that's about right. In terms of the $150 million of cash flow free cash per quarter post getting winter fell and toward to online at a quarterly pace in that sort of $75 Brent, 70 TI. sort of realm on. And yes, I think in terms of the price sensitivity you generally and it will stay roughly the same as about $100 million of free cash flow for the quarter for the year for every $5 change in the oil price and so $25 million plus or minus a quarter. If you move to $80 Brent and then $200 million for the year of $50 of $50 million a quarter $85, Brent said it is yes. And we currently have sort of full access to the upside, so we can fully payments.Matthew SmithIt was very clear thanks for your time and happy to pass it on.Andrew InglisGreat. Thanks, Matt.OperatorI hear our next question is from the line of Mark Wilson with Jefferies. Please go ahead.Mark WilsonThank you. For that and gotten. And gentlemen, my questions regarding the main drivers of production increase into the second half. Would you reiterate your Group guidance 71, 72, and we know that Tortue comes on first LNG in the fourth quarter. Can I just check if that is how you then start to report the gas from Tortue? Or is it in the third quarter as it comes across the FPSO that, that would be my first question.Nealesh ShahSo market will record on an entitlement basis, similar to how we report. But on for just the quarterly production. But in terms of sales, it will be done similar to how we do in Ghana and EG, where it's driven by cargoes. And so overall, entitlement production will be driven by it basically LNG that goes into the FLNG vessel and condensate that goes into the FPSO as a sort of entitlement volumes. But for sales, volumes will ultimately be tied to cargoes the same way we are doing cargoes in Ghana in EG.Mark WilsonGot it. Okay. Understand that. Okay. So FPSO for in 3Q and then entitlement in 4Q and my second question, I guess, and big driver for production would be Jubilee and you just spoke to it there and Andy, to some degree. So taking all those various points into account you still expect that field can average 100 for the rest of the year or even higher?Andrew InglisAgain, as I said, you know, Mark, we're doing what we said. We would do, which is to deliver that outcome, we need to see the incremental benefit of the infill wells for the final two to finish and then optimize the system for the new well configuration and that's ongoing. So that's the first sort of variable that we need to get right. Second is clearly, you know, maintaining the reliability and a good start to the year and we need to continue it. And then I think the fundamental part then is really around bodies replacement and the distribution of that water, again, because we're changing the patterns of offtake because of the new wells coming in the optimization of that patent of the new sort of reservoir offtake partners is critical. So I think there's a lot to work on mark to deliver that outcome? Yes. The first half is in all of that is to get the wells drilled and online, and we've got sort of one more to go so you know this it's you know, there's work to do clearly and then we'll keep you up to date on progress as we go through the quarter.Mark WilsonOkay. Thank you for that question for me. As my understanding on the Yakaar, Teranga is working towards getting the pre-feed out of the way and then that's when you'll be looking it to see what the where the market is that for farm-outs? Is that a fair representation?Andrew InglisYes, it is absolutely, Mark. So, you know, we sort of talk about the future, though, which is really what your question was about. I think that we've got a piece of work now where we're doing the we're completing the pre-FEED. Wondering the pre-FEED done by the middle of the year. And with the pre-FEED, we've got the technical validation of concept and then we've got a cost base to then discuss with the with the new administration. And clearly, this is about creating a new partnership for the actor, Ranga. Our objective is for the present them in a line partner around a third ourselves, a third new partner, the third. So we have to work with the new government to bring that partner in and they're clearly going to have to say in that. And we need to have a fiscal arrangement which enables us to create the economics that support a low-cost gas and LNG export scheme. Now with those two pieces in place, you can then work on the financing. The intent is to have the FLNG vessel, a finance. So there's a series of steps here that this technical work done to be done, which is sort of the milestone in pre-FEED work to be done on alignment with the new administration around fiscals and new partner, and then there's work to be done there for on financing. You bring all those four together, then you can start work on the real world, which is on feed, but we won't be starting feed until we've got those those things done. So again, I think we've made a lot of progress so far on the pre-FEED and post the election. We can now start working on those next items.Mark WilsonAnd that's really appreciate. Then it did occur to me in that answer that maybe the differences between Yakaar Teranga and Verallia and the respective governments would be interested. Interesting to comment on it did look like Marella was moving faster towards the development concept arguably when you last extended PSC and then Yakaar Teranga now has moved to this the set that you have now. So the respective differences, I would be interested to hear your comment on?Andrew InglisYes. Look, I don't think there's a difference. You know, both governments are anxious to enable the development of that gas resources to benefit the country. I think you know, I think the Mauritanian government has been equally clear about its objective to move forward with Perella post the exit of BP. So I don't think there's any fundamental differences there. Mark and therefore, it's about how can we participate to help them on those agendas and come up with compelling investment opportunities.Mark WilsonOkay. Thank you very much and have a great, thanks.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs Asset Management. Please go ahead and Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs Equity Research.Neil MehtaToday, there are a couple of questions I have here. The first is just your your perspective on deleveraging as you get into that free cash flow inflection that Neil referred to, and those are really big numbers now, how do you think about reducing debt on the balance sheet? What are the priorities and now and how what's the target level and how quickly can you?Andrew InglisYes. Thanks, there. One, I'll let the other Neil can answer that anyhow.Nealesh ShahYes, I think, yes, our objective on leveraging hasn't hasn't changed. You would want to get to less than 1.5 times on a sustainable basis through the cycle. And so you the free cash flow that we generate once the projects are online are going to be allocated towards that. And probably initially preferentially towards the RBL, just given it's a floating rate and sort of our highest cost interest piece at the moment. And so yes, we've got some work to do on debt reduction. And that's been a clear priority for the free cash flow. And the and again, I think from our perspective, you'd see sort of the front end of that free cash flow clearly directed towards the RBL. And once we get to less than that 1.5 times in a normalized oil price environment and it comes around sort of the competing priorities in terms of and there's some allocation towards debt repayment versus capital returns and so on that, that's a discussion we have in the future. But yes, as today, we'll continue to focus on just getting to that less than 1.5 times the normalized price first, that makes sense.Neil MehtaNow when giving opportunity to talk about the the convertible bond issuance issuances that create a lot of volatility around the stock. I think a lot of it was just to manage near-term interest expense around floating rate debt. So just your perspective and why that why you thought that was the most cost effective approach to financing? How should we think about that over overall?Nealesh ShahAnd so again, we've had a number of discussions around the convertible on both debt and equity holders over the last couple of months since we executed that back in March. And again, I think for us is around where our current bonds are trading and how do we optimize access to the debt capital markets for that at a sort of? Yes, the lowest cost available and the issue that we've had for the past 18 months when you look back into 22 and 23 is really where Ghana has traded and therefore the impact to our secondary levels on the bonds and therefore, a new issuance in the regular bond market would have been quite expensive just from a regular new-issue native new-issue market and therefore trying to get ahead of the liquidity and maturity wall on something that we've always tried to be proactive about. And so I thought that was the best instrument at the time to you to manage the maturity schedule. And as you can see in the presentation with that and the RBL, we've really cleared the runway for the next couple of years for us to execute and continue to pay down debt. And so it's really around taking the balance sheet off the agenda, focusing on the organic delivery of the business plan and using that sort of the most efficient tool at the time and tried to execute that. So yes, that was really the background.OperatorOur next question is from the line of Subash Chandra with The Benchmark Company. Please go ahead.Subash ChandraThank you, guys. Following up, I guess on Neil, couple of quick couple of other questions. With regards to free cash flow is sort of the organizing principle you know, beyond the next year to sort of be in that five, 600 mill maintenance CapEx number and then everything beyond that, obviously pay the RBL off and then payouts et cetera? Or are there some appetites that you might have deferred pending getting to TA on some either organic or acquisition oriented that might get us to a different spend level? Down the road?Andrew InglisYes, I think, Sebastian, we just take that. You know, I think when we talked about the five 50, we've talked about it from two dimensions. We've talked about a sort of base maintenance capital of 300 to 3 50, which so that covers the the infill drilling program in Ghana, the continuing development of Jubilee, it covers the infill program in Equatorial Guinea that I talked about earlier. And then you know what sort of post the startup of wind fell and then tie various looking longer-term, the additional wells that so I think we probably are allocating capital to that. And clearly, those are very high-return projects. And then we've talked on top of that about sort of 200 to 50 of spend that would be in growth included to the two projects that we're focused on today are Iberia's and and the extra Ranga with an expansion project at Tortue. And that capital on that 200 to 50 incorporates the spend on those projects sort of post financing bank financing of the i., the FPSO on online. So Yakaar Teranga. So I think we're what we're clear about the forward projection of the Company where we believe we can not only can we can grow. It'll be more modest right than we have. We have done over the last two years. There is growth in high quality projects and it will be a mix of sort of a low-cost low-carbon oil, you know, EG. type, various low-cost, low-carbon gas, EG. and expansion of Phase one, you know, Yakaar Teranga, so you know, and it's sort of mid single digits, middle single digits sort of growth rates, but at the same time with our capital level of five 50. Now we believe we can and we have significant free cash flow, which as Neil says, we can direct to the paydown of debt. And then subsequently, when we get to the right leverage levels, we can look at shareholder distribution. And I think that yes, that's ultimately what differentiates Cosmos as a company. It has an organic on activity set, which you can sustain really, you know, through decade and beyond. We are we have an RP of over 20 on a 2P basis so the ability to it creates something now which can not only continue to grow but can actually return cash and with we think a really competitive free cash flow yield is something that's quite unique. So that's our objective now. So we're clear about the frame. And I think that's a point that I absolutely want to emphasize on the call. The five 50 in that sense is clear and where we're clear about the capital frame and therefore how it's going to be allocated.Subash ChandraGot it. Okay. So I hear you loud and clear so no real interest in external opportunities. I mean, given what seems like a greater churn in sort of the assets, whether they're stranded gas or the Gulf of Mexico, et cetera, you're going to stick with the with the footprint you have?Andrew InglisYes, I think what don't we know what we've been clear about ships, C-BASS is that on any inorganic has to be accretive from a cash flow basis that actually that accelerates that journey. Yes. And I think that that's having set that out as the organic path of the Company to improve upon it, you have to accelerate it through an organic and inorganic. That actually is cash significantly cash flow accretive, which it has been the case for the three acquisitions that we've actually done as we've grown the Company equally well, there may be opportunity, you know, and particularly on the gas side to lighten the portfolio, which again accelerates that to that objective so I think we were absolutely clear about the company we're building. And therefore, as it were how an inorganic opportunity would fit, what we don't have to do clearly is buying things to mitigate the decline. We do not have declined. And I think that's again what differentiates us from a from a from others. So if something is accretive from a cash flow perspective, inorganically accelerates that quality assets. Then clearly those are the things we look for equally well, the reverse if we can accelerate the delivery of free cash flow for our shareholders and by lightening, let's turn on the gas assets, then we would do that.Subash ChandraThank you for that.Andrew InglisGreat. All right. Thank you.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, since there are no further questions at this time. I would like to bring the call to a close. Thanks to everyone joining today. You may now disconnect your lines, and thank you for your participation.",

reminder  this conference is being recorded  it is now my pleasure to introduce your host  jamie buckland  vp  investor relations  please go ahead jamie bucklandthank you  operator  and thanks to everyone for joining us today this morning  we issued our first quarter 2024 earnings release  this release and the slide presentation to accompany today s call are available on the investors page of our website  joining me on the call today  to go through the materials are andy inglis  chairman and ceo  and neal shah  cfo  during today s presentation  we will make forward looking statements that refer to our estimates  plans and expectations  actual results and outcomes could differ materially due to factors we note in the presentation and in our uk and sec filings  please refer to our annual report  stock exchange announcement and sec filings for more details  these documents are available on our website  and at this time  i ll turn the call over to andy andrew inglisthanks  jamie  and good morning and afternoon  to everyone  thank you for joining us today for our first quarter results call  it s been an active start to the year for cosmos  and i ll start today s presentation  looking at the operational and financial momentum we ve built in the first few months of the year  neil will then walk you through this quarter s financial results before i look ahead to the catalysts for the remainder of the year  we ll then open up the call for q a  starting on slide 3  with the delivery of our major projects  cosmos had a strong first quarter with significant progress towards our goal of growing production by around 50  from the second half of 2022 to the end of 2024  in ghana  all the planned 2020 for jubilee production wells are online with one water injection well expected online later this quarter  following completion of this well  the planned drilling campaign will conclude approximately six months ahead of schedule as a result of efficiencies in the drilling operations in the gulf of mexico  oil production of windsor 12 is expected to begin shortly from the initial two wells  our third well is due to come online later this year  increasing our expected gross production to around 20 000 barrels of oil per day in mauritania and senegal  the tortue project continues to move towards first gas with several key milestones achieved already this year  i ll talk more about our progress on these projects later in the presentation  looking further ahead  we continue to advance our next phase of growth projects  long lead items are being secured for time  various to optimize the development time line and project costs  we have also secured a two year license extension for yakaar teranga  while we see continued growth as an important part of the company s future  as i said last quarter  it will be selective and more measured in the coming years  consistent with sustained annual capex of around  550 million per year  that is targeted from 2025 onwards  on the financial side of the business we enhanced the company s financial resilience with the convertible bond issuance and the rbl refinancing  neil will talk about these in more detail shortly  the transactions improved liquidity and extended our near term maturities  the free cash flow inflection point we ve been anticipating of around  100 million to  150 million per quarter once our development projects come online is now only a few months away  i ll now talk through the operational progress across our different business units  starting in ghana on slide 4  jubilee production in the first quarter was around 93 000 barrels of oil per day growth  almost 30  higher than the first quarter last year  this reflects the progress made from both the startup of the jubilee southeast project and the ongoing infill drilling program  jubilee fpso reliability continues to remain high at approximately 99  uptime for the first quarter  moody s replacement was also strong in the quarter  around 110  as a result of high levels of water and gas injection gross jubilee gas sales for the quarter was around 16 500 barrels of oil equivalent per day  recently  the partnership agreed an 18 month extension to the jubilee gas sales agreement for approximately  3 per mmbtu  in the second quarter  there is some planned maintenance of the onshore plant  which receives the jubilee gas  and this is reflected in the 2q 2q guidance on 10 gross production at 18 600 barrels of oil per day was in line with expectations with high fpso uptime of around 99   similar to jubilee  turning to slide 5  production in the gulf of mexico for the quarter was approximately 14 500 barrels of oil equivalent per day net in line with guidance at windsor file  where kosmos has a 25  working interest  first oil from the two initial wells is expected shortly with another well expected online in the second half of the year  gross production when all three wells were online is expected to be around 20 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day  we estimate total gross resource across greater wind fell about 200 million barrels of oil equivalent  providing significant future follow on potential to enhance existing production  we continue to invest selectively in high return projects like the old job  subsea pump and kodiak workover both expected to finish around the middle of the year  the combined uplift from both of these projects is expected to contribute around 5 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day  net cosmos is year end exit rate  the tornado field is expected to be offline for most of the second quarter for scheduled routine maintenance of the hp  one floating production unit  which has been factored into our guidance for the quarter on type areas where cosmos is  operator  we acquired part of ecuador s interest during the first quarter to maintain an aligned partnership  we now hold a 50  interest in the project  which is already included in our 2024 capital guidance  this phased developments as subsea tieback to oxy s nearby lucius platform is progressing  project sanction expected later in the year  certain long lead items have been secured to optimize the development time line and project costs around the time of project sanction  cosmos plans to farm down to optimize our working interest to fit within our targeted capital program for 2025 and beyond  please turn to slide 6  production in equatorial guinea averaged approximately 24 400 barrels of oil per day gross and 8 400 net in the first quarter  cosmos lifted one cargo from actual guinea during the quarter  in line with guidance in early february  as previously communicated  the operator pause  the sabra and the two main drilling campaign as a result of safety issues with the previous rig  the partnership has now secured the noble venture to resume the drilling campaign with a rig expected on location midyear  the rig is scheduled to drill and complete two infill wells in block g before moving to drill the king deep ilx prospects in block hours new infill wells are expected to add around 3 000 barrels of oil per day net to kosmos at year end exit rate  the result of the king deep well  which is targeting gross resource of around 180 million barrels is expected around the end of the year  turning to slide 7  the greater tortue acumen project continues to move towards first gas with significant progress across all work streams so far this year with first gas expected in the third quarter and first lng expected in the fourth quarter  floating lng vessel arrived in the first quarter as being more to the hub terminal  the partnership is now working with the vessel operator to accelerate commissioning  the subsea work is progressing in line with expectations with a flowline installation complete and final connection work  ongoing inspection and repair of the fdso  fairly is now complete and the vessel has left tenerife and his own route to the project site  good morning work to commence thereafter  hookup and commissioning of the fpso remains on the critical path  first gas  which is expected in the first quarter i ll now turn it over to neil to take you through the financials story continuesnealesh shahthanks  andy  turning to slide 8  which looks at the first quarter production in the quarter of approximately 66 700 barrels of oil equivalent per day net was an increase of around 13  compared to the same quarter last year  costs for the quarter were within or slightly better than guidance leading to the earnings beat against consensus  capex for the first quarter was  286 million  which was in line with guidance and is largely made up of the ghana drilling campaign and the progress made on both winter fell and on tortue  as previously communicated  we expect the majority of this year s capex be in the first half of this year with the free cash flow inflection that andy talked about in his opening slide expected as the development projects complete and production ramps up throughout the end of the year  turning to slide 9  which looks at our debt maturities  we took two important steps this year to further enhance the financial resilience of the company  first was the convertible bond issuance in march  which proactively replaces the liquidity from the  250 million undrawn rcf is due to expire at the end of this year  the convertible also lowered our overall interest expense as we paid down a portion of our rbl with the available proceeds  which is our highest cost debt  we ve also seen the yields on our high yield bonds tightened  which should help pricing when we come to think about potentially refinancing those in the future to limit future equity dilution  we purchased a capped call  which means there will be no dilution until the shares get to almost  11 per share  we also took the option to cash settle the principal amount raised  which also reduces any future dilution second important step was the refinancing of our reserve based lending facility with in terms of broadly in line with the previous facility  the overall facility size increased to  1 35 billion from  1 25 billion with current commitments of around  1 2 billion through the refinancing  we have extended the final maturity by approximately three years at the same time  we have had some of our banks transfer their commitment to the rbl from the rcf  which  as i mentioned  expires at the end of this year  i d like to thank our banks for their continued support as we continue to grow the company  the chart on the right shows the impact of both the convertible bond issuance and the rbl refinancing on the maturity schedule  we now have no near term debt and the staggered maturity schedule from 2026 onwards as we reach the expected free cash flow inflection point plan to continue to prioritize paying down the rbl  reducing the amounts in the dark blue  on the chart on the right  we continue to target leverage below 1 5 times at mid cycle oil prices with deleveraging expected minutes once revenues from ford to start up later in the year  with that  i ll hand it back to andy to conclude today s presentation andrew inglisturning now to slide 10  as i said in my opening remarks  it was a busy first quarter and we have achieved a lot in just three months  the operational financial momentum we built has rolled into the second quarter with several milestones already achieved and more to come in the near future  the graphic on this slide shows a rich portfolio of catalysts throughout the year across all our business units  they contribute towards our goal for year end exit rate of 90 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day  net free cash flow inflection points combined  we believe these will create significant value for our shareholders  thank you  and i d now like to turn the call over to the operator to open the session questions question and answer sessionoperatorthank you  ladies and gentlemen  we will now be conducting a question and answer session  if you d like to ask a question  please press star and one on your telephone keypad  a confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue  you may press star and two if you d like to remove your question from the queue for participants using speaker equipment  it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys  ladies and gentlemen  we will wait for a moment while poll for questions  our first question is from the line of david round with stifel  please go ahead david roundthanks  thanks for the presentation  guys  just two questions from me  please  firstly  can i just ask about senegal  please  and whether the following the recent elections that you ve seen any impact at all to business activities in country  and there s been quite a lot in the press  so i d appreciate any comments there  please  secondly  just some on equatorial guinea  obviously good to see activity there again  that s obviously been a great asset from memory  that was quite a big in place number there with a relatively modest recovery factor so far  i m just wondering  could that become a bigger  an area of activity going forward once you see capex elsewhere  drop off andrew inglisyes  david  yes  thanks to both of those are picked them up  i think  you know  turning to senegal first  i think the starting point is really is that elections in our host countries and our new for cosmos and our ethos is to align with the countries and their needs irrespective of changes of government  i think in senegal  our approach is no different where we re enabling the development of low cost gas to sustainably grow the senegalese economy and drive social progress for the country  so there s a high degree of alignment between what we re doing and the new government s objectives which are clear  they want to lower the cost of living for its population and improve the improve economic environment  i think it s early days for the new administration  there are many officials still to be appointed  but my team in santiago have have met with the new energy and mining minister  and i m pleased to say it was a very constructive dialogue  you know that the conversation centered around actually how can we accelerate the development of the gas resources to accelerate the the benefits to the country  so  you know  in terms of the day to day  i know our business center goes unchanged  we re working to bring phase one online later this year  it moved forward with a capital efficient phase two  the expansion of phase one that will enhance the revenues to the states and the partners and then move forward with a domestic gas lng export scheme and yt   all of which will bring economic and social benefits for the country  so i do think is a real basis for a win win  and i m pleased to say that we re actually in a constructive dialogue as to how we shape that shape that agenda  and on equatorial guinea  i think you re correct to say that there s actually a lot of undeveloped resource  and when we initially took over the asset  it was it was about enhancing the production from essentially sort of workover activities  if you remember  i think it was  you know  we talked about it being gas lift constrained  so we actually move to esps  and we ve seen the benefit of that activity  we re now moving  i think  into a different phase  which is about infill drilling  which is this the current campaign as you rightly say we re targeting an infill well in cyber and one in the queue may and then actually we re following it up with the king deal  which is a test a deeper test of the albian  and clearly  if it if that comes in  we ve got a significant amount of knowledge in the room in the facilities to bring that on and very short tieback distances  so i think we ve got sort of  you know  two avenues and what we would see for per se  but it to me is a and an intermittent at the infill drilling campaign  we know two or three wells every sort of 18 months  something like that where i think you can certainly sustain the production profile  all of that capex is is in the forward forecast of maintenance of the base  and then  you know  with a king  do you think you ve got the ability to actually grow the profile  so i think we ve got a clear plan about sustaining the profile in actual g a through that infill drilling with  i think still some some sort of workover type activities growth coming  if you had success i kingdee  so i think you know  it s been a really good acquisition  i think we worked really well too on now go through a very programmatic program to target the video  the quick wins  which were really around so the workover activities  and now we re moving into a more phased approach with the with infill  but there s plenty to go out here and clearly having the capacity in the facilities  it enables us to move it forward quickly david roundthanks  andy andrew inglisthanks  david operatorthank you  our next question is from the line of charles meade with johnson rice charles meadei m sure you re probably more excited than we are to see that  that fpso underway  and so congratulations for that  but wondering if you can take us through just the highlights or what the next pieces or pieces of the puzzle or milestones are to get to first gas  i imagine that that s some pieces  it would be getting the getting the fpso more broken up the risers  introducing the gas the flg  and then go into the whole flng cool down  but maybe you can elaborate that or add pieces to it that we should be on the lookout for andrew inglisi love questions whether you ve already answered the question  joe  sorry about that  and i think you ve got it  i think  jim  clearly  i think we ve had a lot of progress in the in this sort of first four months of the year  we ve got the flng vessel now at the hub terminal  it s more than the and the connection work is ongoing  the last piece of equipment arrived to the fpso  which you said it will be on location in the matter of few days  the next step then is the is morning and while some borrowings  then we start to work on the top signs in terms of the commissioning work and the hookup of the rise is clearly the step that enables a gas to be introduced  and then it s a question of the gas  as you say  coming into the flng vessel  you start to cool down process and then you start to make flng first cargo  et cetera  so i think the as you look through that process  you described an arena really well  where are we with the subsea equipment  all the major pieces of that are now doing the final tie ins and that work is proceeding as we envisage  so we re pleased with the progress there  the fpso work  the hookup and commissioning of the fpso remains on the critical path  but clearly  getting the vessel on location has enabled us to start to liquidate that activity  so i think  you know  you were well on track to do what we said we were going to do and the milestones have been achieved so far this year  so getting the fpso on location is clearly an important step  and then we ll update you next quarter as we now get that work behind us and hopefully  you know  with the completion of the riser hookup and then the i which will then allow us to start flowing gas charles meadegot it  and then the follow up  i wonder if you could you could add some some detail and context around the rollout exploration  i m wondering if this is kind of along the lines of how yakaar teranga played out in that bp   maybe it didn t want to be involved  but you guys are still you guys still have some some plans and you just tell us what s going on and a good andrew inglisyes  good question  charles  i think that you re going to be sort of step back  it was sort of some  you know  repeating the both yt  ambarella will scale discovered gas resources  you know  sort of in place numbers  i think a yg  25 tcf per outlet probably around 30 tcf and we believe it is advantaged gas  it has negligible co2 and it s close to your home  so with bp no longer on either license  we can now work independently with the nocs of both countries on innovative cost efficient schemes that bp didn t propose  but we believe will lead to attractive returns for both the project partners and the government we ve secured the license on yt  we ve secured the extension to allow us to proceed with that work  and then we re in discussions with the with the mauritanian government around how we can help them progress the development brand that they re keen to move it forward  and we believe we have both the subsurface knowledge and the concept that will enable it to be an attractive project  so i think that s where we are  and there s been a lot of third party interest in the assets as well  so we believe that actually working both with patterson on yt  and smh  umbrella  we re trying to create an equal partnership where they re properly represented  which we believe is actually a good thing  clearly for both government and we re working with them to find ways to bring in a partner that will enable the development to move forward  so i think you characterized it correctly  and we re energized to work on that agenda charles meadegreat  thanks for the detail andrew inglisgreat  thanks  charles operatorand thank you  our next question is from the line of bob brackett with bernstein research  please go ahead bob brackettgood morning  charles de stole most of my thunder  so let me tried to it a lot  the tortue fpso  so that vessel s been expected by the operator by you all passed muster and so it is ready to go andrew inglisyes  you know  as with all things  bob  you know  as it were because of having to do the work on the fairly it is a blessing that it does allow us to what we had additional sort of three months and generated close to three months in january to further progress the topsides work  so i think we understand the scope very well  and i think you re right to sort of push the question around fpsos has sailed in the past with a lot of work to come to execute  so i think we ve got a good understanding of what the work scope is clearly and therefore  clear plans on how to execute that work scope  so yes  i feel good about that and nothing s done until it s done  but clearly  we do have  i think  the advantages of having extra time to work on the on the topsides as a result of the time on the on the fairly it s very clear bob brackettthe follow up  good comes back to bear  all of the psc had been extended for two years view and the government and bp had been working in good faith to kind of push that project along the clock ran out  how do we think about whether you are the natural owner of a partnership that brings that asset to market or does it go to a competitive bid where you re in line with one of many and i m intrigued by what you think the concept could be for fast track development there andrew inglisyes  no  yes  interesting  bob  i think that  you know  the government is actually trying to find a way of moving the project forward in a constructive way  and what do i mean by that  actually they could go out to the market with bids  et cetera  would you have clearly the the negative of that is that it creates an uncertain partnership  you know  you re on bringing potentially somebody new that doesn t have the subsurface knowledge that we have  we believe there is a genuine desire to trial and work with existing partners who have the knowledge and  you know  we ve probably  you know  we bring the knowledge of and two wells in barilla one  i m assume one on orca  we bring the knowledge of all the appraisal wells on gca and the development wells on gta and then the calibration of the seismic against against that dataset  so there s significant knowledge  i believe that we bring in terms of the development concept  it s really about how do you get cost efficient in terms of the subsea layout  and ultimately  that s where we ve seen the big cost increases in the industry is in the is in the subsea  so minimizing that architecture  you minimize that actually by putting the flng vessel directly out of the field that has the additional benefit of lowering the pressure drops  which gives you enhanced recovery  so those  you know  without going into engineering in too much detail  but those are the those are the ways in which you can change the cost basis of the development  and those are the concepts are working on and why ti and those are the concepts we re bringing to bear to bear our very clear  thank you bob brackettgreat  thank you nealesh shahthanks  bob operatorthank you  our next question is from matthew smith with bank of america  please go ahead matthew smithhey  good morning  guys  thanks for taking my questions and a couple  please  and the first one was just and apologies if i missed some of the commentary around this at the start of the call  but any additional color you could give us on the performance of  unk  in ghana  i guess at jubilee  in particular in the quarter  just how that s fared versus your own expectations  what confidence that gives you in the full year outlook  because you had an additional oil producer online in april  if you could sort of talk to that at all and sort of exit rates  what you ve seen post the quarter  just to sort of frame how ghana started the year off and the confidence that gives you for the rest of the year that that would be interesting to hear them yet  but perhaps i ll try and come back to the second andrew inglisokay  yes  thanks  emma  i think sort of updating you sort of if you look across march and april  i think we averaged around 95 000 barrels of oil per day  so as you say  we brought on the recently just brought on the the final producer  and we re optimizing its setup in the subsea to maximize the benefits from that  and then finally  we ve got the final water injection  which is currently being drilled and actually we re going to start the completion of that shortly  so i think the i think it s early days  you say as you look forward to the performance of the field over the remaining part of the year  i think those are the three fundamental things we re focusing on  you know  the first is the contribution of the recently added wells to the ramp up in rate on the second is we had really good reliability in the in the first quarter and that you re close to 99  on the jubilee fpso  clearly we need to maintain that high level of reliability going forward  and then i think the third one is really the most important point is around maintaining the high levels of bodies replacement on that was that was a challenge last year where we had downtime and didn t get to 100  now  we sort of were pretty good in the first quarter and we need to sort of maintain that going forward  we have had a gtg  down  i think  for a couple of weeks  so we probably have been slightly under 100 temps and in the last month  but that is you know that that s a critical factor  so i think it s  you know  if those are the things where we re focusing on and therefore  those are the things that are going to influence the outcome across the rest of the year  all that said  the drilling has actually gone well  you know  we ve firm  we ve really drilled in other the operators and the great job on the drilling performance and the wells and the timing of the wells has absolutely met  you know  our our expectations  and you know  when the final water injection is done  i think over this program we probably created probably close to six months a reduction in the overall program  which is pretty impressive  and so that s sort of where we stand today  matt  and that pivot matthew smiththanks  andy  that s really helpful  and perhaps the second one and perhaps would be for neil  i imagine just coming back to the free cash flow sort of indication that you ve given us  100 million to  150 million per quarter  and once the growth projects through our online  i think if i if i remember rightly  you talk to that sort of being underpinned broadly speaking by a  70 wti   75 brent  are there please correct me if i ever mistaken there  but i just wondered if you could speak to sort of sensitivities and upside to those free cash flow numbers if we re in an  80 or  85 brent world nealesh shahyes  sure  matt  and yes  that s about right  in terms of the  150 million of cash flow free cash per quarter post getting winter fell and toward to online at a quarterly pace in that sort of  75 brent  70 ti  sort of realm on  and yes  i think in terms of the price sensitivity you generally and it will stay roughly the same as about  100 million of free cash flow for the quarter for the year for every  5 change in the oil price and so  25 million plus or minus a quarter  if you move to  80 brent and then  200 million for the year of  50 of  50 million a quarter  85  brent said it is yes  and we currently have sort of full access to the upside  so we can fully payments matthew smithit was very clear thanks for your time and happy to pass it on andrew inglisgreat  thanks  matt operatori hear our next question is from the line of mark wilson with jefferies  please go ahead mark wilsonthank you  for that and gotten  and gentlemen  my questions regarding the main drivers of production increase into the second half  would you reiterate your group guidance 71  72  and we know that tortue comes on first lng in the fourth quarter  can i just check if that is how you then start to report the gas from tortue  or is it in the third quarter as it comes across the fpso that  that would be my first question nealesh shahso market will record on an entitlement basis  similar to how we report  but on for just the quarterly production  but in terms of sales  it will be done similar to how we do in ghana and eg  where it s driven by cargoes  and so overall  entitlement production will be driven by it basically lng that goes into the flng vessel and condensate that goes into the fpso as a sort of entitlement volumes  but for sales  volumes will ultimately be tied to cargoes the same way we are doing cargoes in ghana in eg mark wilsongot it  okay  understand that  okay  so fpso for in 3q and then entitlement in 4q and my second question  i guess  and big driver for production would be jubilee and you just spoke to it there and andy  to some degree  so taking all those various points into account you still expect that field can average 100 for the rest of the year or even higher andrew inglisagain  as i said  you know  mark  we re doing what we said  we would do  which is to deliver that outcome  we need to see the incremental benefit of the infill wells for the final two to finish and then optimize the system for the new well configuration and that s ongoing  so that s the first sort of variable that we need to get right  second is clearly  you know  maintaining the reliability and a good start to the year and we need to continue it  and then i think the fundamental part then is really around bodies replacement and the distribution of that water  again  because we re changing the patterns of offtake because of the new wells coming in the optimization of that patent of the new sort of reservoir offtake partners is critical  so i think there s a lot to work on mark to deliver that outcome  yes  the first half is in all of that is to get the wells drilled and online  and we ve got sort of one more to go so you know this it s you know  there s work to do clearly and then we ll keep you up to date on progress as we go through the quarter mark wilsonokay  thank you for that question for me  as my understanding on the yakaar  teranga is working towards getting the pre feed out of the way and then that s when you ll be looking it to see what the where the market is that for farm outs  is that a fair representation andrew inglisyes  it is absolutely  mark  so  you know  we sort of talk about the future  though  which is really what your question was about  i think that we ve got a piece of work now where we re doing the we re completing the pre feed  wondering the pre feed done by the middle of the year  and with the pre feed  we ve got the technical validation of concept and then we ve got a cost base to then discuss with the with the new administration  and clearly  this is about creating a new partnership for the actor  ranga  our objective is for the present them in a line partner around a third ourselves  a third new partner  the third  so we have to work with the new government to bring that partner in and they re clearly going to have to say in that  and we need to have a fiscal arrangement which enables us to create the economics that support a low cost gas and lng export scheme  now with those two pieces in place  you can then work on the financing  the intent is to have the flng vessel  a finance  so there s a series of steps here that this technical work done to be done  which is sort of the milestone in pre feed work to be done on alignment with the new administration around fiscals and new partner  and then there s work to be done there for on financing  you bring all those four together  then you can start work on the real world  which is on feed  but we won t be starting feed until we ve got those those things done  so again  i think we ve made a lot of progress so far on the pre feed and post the election  we can now start working on those next items mark wilsonand that s really appreciate  then it did occur to me in that answer that maybe the differences between yakaar teranga and verallia and the respective governments would be interested  interesting to comment on it did look like marella was moving faster towards the development concept arguably when you last extended psc and then yakaar teranga now has moved to this the set that you have now  so the respective differences  i would be interested to hear your comment on andrew inglisyes  look  i don t think there s a difference  you know  both governments are anxious to enable the development of that gas resources to benefit the country  i think you know  i think the mauritanian government has been equally clear about its objective to move forward with perella post the exit of bp  so i don t think there s any fundamental differences there  mark and therefore  it s about how can we participate to help them on those agendas and come up with compelling investment opportunities mark wilsonokay  thank you very much and have a great  thanks operatorthank you  our next question comes from the line of neil mehta with goldman sachs asset management  please go ahead and neil mehta with goldman sachs equity research neil mehtatoday  there are a couple of questions i have here  the first is just your your perspective on deleveraging as you get into that free cash flow inflection that neil referred to  and those are really big numbers now  how do you think about reducing debt on the balance sheet  what are the priorities and now and how what s the target level and how quickly can you andrew inglisyes  thanks  there  one  i ll let the other neil can answer that anyhow nealesh shahyes  i think  yes  our objective on leveraging hasn t hasn t changed  you would want to get to less than 1 5 times on a sustainable basis through the cycle  and so you the free cash flow that we generate once the projects are online are going to be allocated towards that  and probably initially preferentially towards the rbl  just given it s a floating rate and sort of our highest cost interest piece at the moment  and so yes  we ve got some work to do on debt reduction  and that s been a clear priority for the free cash flow  and the and again  i think from our perspective  you d see sort of the front end of that free cash flow clearly directed towards the rbl  and once we get to less than that 1 5 times in a normalized oil price environment and it comes around sort of the competing priorities in terms of and there s some allocation towards debt repayment versus capital returns and so on that  that s a discussion we have in the future  but yes  as today  we ll continue to focus on just getting to that less than 1 5 times the normalized price first  that makes sense neil mehtanow when giving opportunity to talk about the the convertible bond issuance issuances that create a lot of volatility around the stock  i think a lot of it was just to manage near term interest expense around floating rate debt  so just your perspective and why that why you thought that was the most cost effective approach to financing  how should we think about that over overall nealesh shahand so again  we ve had a number of discussions around the convertible on both debt and equity holders over the last couple of months since we executed that back in march  and again  i think for us is around where our current bonds are trading and how do we optimize access to the debt capital markets for that at a sort of  yes  the lowest cost available and the issue that we ve had for the past 18 months when you look back into 22 and 23 is really where ghana has traded and therefore the impact to our secondary levels on the bonds and therefore  a new issuance in the regular bond market would have been quite expensive just from a regular new issue native new issue market and therefore trying to get ahead of the liquidity and maturity wall on something that we ve always tried to be proactive about  and so i thought that was the best instrument at the time to you to manage the maturity schedule  and as you can see in the presentation with that and the rbl  we ve really cleared the runway for the next couple of years for us to execute and continue to pay down debt  and so it s really around taking the balance sheet off the agenda  focusing on the organic delivery of the business plan and using that sort of the most efficient tool at the time and tried to execute that  so yes  that was really the background operatorour next question is from the line of subash chandra with the benchmark company  please go ahead subash chandrathank you  guys  following up  i guess on neil  couple of quick couple of other questions  with regards to free cash flow is sort of the organizing principle you know  beyond the next year to sort of be in that five  600 mill maintenance capex number and then everything beyond that  obviously pay the rbl off and then payouts et cetera  or are there some appetites that you might have deferred pending getting to ta on some either organic or acquisition oriented that might get us to a different spend level  down the road andrew inglisyes  i think  sebastian  we just take that  you know  i think when we talked about the five 50  we ve talked about it from two dimensions  we ve talked about a sort of base maintenance capital of 300 to 3 50  which so that covers the the infill drilling program in ghana  the continuing development of jubilee  it covers the infill program in equatorial guinea that i talked about earlier  and then you know what sort of post the startup of wind fell and then tie various looking longer term  the additional wells that so i think we probably are allocating capital to that  and clearly  those are very high return projects  and then we ve talked on top of that about sort of 200 to 50 of spend that would be in growth included to the two projects that we re focused on today are iberia s and and the extra ranga with an expansion project at tortue  and that capital on that 200 to 50 incorporates the spend on those projects sort of post financing bank financing of the i   the fpso on online  so yakaar teranga  so i think we re what we re clear about the forward projection of the company where we believe we can not only can we can grow  it ll be more modest right than we have  we have done over the last two years  there is growth in high quality projects and it will be a mix of sort of a low cost low carbon oil  you know  eg  type  various low cost  low carbon gas  eg  and expansion of phase one  you know  yakaar teranga  so you know  and it s sort of mid single digits  middle single digits sort of growth rates  but at the same time with our capital level of five 50  now we believe we can and we have significant free cash flow  which as neil says  we can direct to the paydown of debt  and then subsequently  when we get to the right leverage levels  we can look at shareholder distribution  and i think that yes  that s ultimately what differentiates cosmos as a company  it has an organic on activity set  which you can sustain really  you know  through decade and beyond  we are we have an rp of over 20 on a 2p basis so the ability to it creates something now which can not only continue to grow but can actually return cash and with we think a really competitive free cash flow yield is something that s quite unique  so that s our objective now  so we re clear about the frame  and i think that s a point that i absolutely want to emphasize on the call  the five 50 in that sense is clear and where we re clear about the capital frame and therefore how it s going to be allocated subash chandragot it  okay  so i hear you loud and clear so no real interest in external opportunities  i mean  given what seems like a greater churn in sort of the assets  whether they re stranded gas or the gulf of mexico  et cetera  you re going to stick with the with the footprint you have andrew inglisyes  i think what don t we know what we ve been clear about ships  c bass is that on any inorganic has to be accretive from a cash flow basis that actually that accelerates that journey  yes  and i think that that s having set that out as the organic path of the company to improve upon it  you have to accelerate it through an organic and inorganic  that actually is cash significantly cash flow accretive  which it has been the case for the three acquisitions that we ve actually done as we ve grown the company equally well  there may be opportunity  you know  and particularly on the gas side to lighten the portfolio  which again accelerates that to that objective so i think we were absolutely clear about the company we re building  and therefore  as it were how an inorganic opportunity would fit  what we don t have to do clearly is buying things to mitigate the decline  we do not have declined  and i think that s again what differentiates us from a from a from others  so if something is accretive from a cash flow perspective  inorganically accelerates that quality assets  then clearly those are the things we look for equally well  the reverse if we can accelerate the delivery of free cash flow for our shareholders and by lightening  let s turn on the gas assets  then we would do that subash chandrathank you for that andrew inglisgreat  all right  thank you operatorladies and gentlemen  since there are no further questions at this time  i would like to bring the call to a close  thanks to everyone joining today  you may now disconnect your lines  and thank you for your participation ',

                        'DALLAS, May 07, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Kosmos Energy Ltd. ("Kosmos" or the "Company") (NYSE/LSE: KOS) announced today its financial and operating results for the first quarter of 2024. For the quarter, the Company generated a net income of $92 million, or $0.19 per diluted share. When adjusted for certain items that impact the comparability of results, the Company generated an adjusted net income(1) of $99 million, or $0.21 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2024.FIRST QUARTER 2024 HIGHLIGHTSNet Production(2): ~66,700 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd), representing ~13% growth year over year, with sales of ~62,600 boepdRevenues: $419 million, or $73.52 per boe (excluding the impact of derivative cash settlements)Production expense: $94 million, or $16.42 per boeCapital expenditures: $286 millionSuccessfully completed convertible bond issuance, enhancing liquidity and paying down higher interest floating rate debtPost quarter end, successfully refinanced the Company\'s reserve-based lending (RBL) facility, extending maturity to year-end 2029Post quarter end, contracted a drilling rig for the Equatorial Guinea 2024 infill and infrastructure-led exploration (ILX) campaignCommenting on the Company’s first quarter 2024 performance, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Andrew G. Inglis said: "Kosmos has had an active start to the year, continuing the operational and financial momentum we saw in 2023. Operationally, we\'ve brought four new wells online at Jubilee and first oil at Winterfell is expected shortly, both important milestones for the Company as we target 50% production growth from the second half of 2022 to year-end 2024. We\'ve also seen significant progress at Tortue with the FLNG arriving on location, completion of the deepwater pipelay and the FPSO en route to the project site. In Equatorial Guinea, we\'re pleased to have secured a high quality rig for the infill and ILX campaign later this year. We are also advancing our next set of growth projects, securing long lead items for Tiberius and a two-year license extension granted for Yakaar-Teranga.Financially, we enhanced the resilience of the Company with a successful convertible bond offering and the re-financing of the RBL. Both transactions were important steps to proactively increase liquidity and extend our near-term debt maturities.Our strategy remains on track with a busy year of catalysts ahead across all of our business units in Ghana, Equatorial Guinea, the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Mauritania and Senegal."Story continuesFINANCIAL UPDATENet capital expenditure for the first quarter of 2024 was $286 million, in line with guidance. Full-year capital expenditures are expected to be weighted to the first half of the year as the Ghana drilling program concludes and the Winterfell and Tortue Phase 1 projects progress to start-up.Kosmos exited the first quarter of 2024 with approximately $2.7 billion of total long-term debt and approximately $2.4 billion of net debt(1) and available liquidity of approximately $954 million. Post quarter-end, the Company successfully refinanced the RBL facility, which now matures at the end of 2029. The facility size increased to $1.35 billion (from $1.25 billion) with current commitments as of April 26, 2024 of approximately $1.2 billion. The RBL facility is secured against the Company’s production assets in Ghana and Equatorial Guinea. The Company\'s assets in the US Gulf of Mexico and Mauritania and Senegal remain unencumbered.The Company generated net cash provided by operating activities of approximately $273 million and free cash flow(1) of approximately $(42) million in the first quarter.OPERATIONAL UPDATEProductionTotal net production(2) in the first quarter of 2024 averaged approximately 66,700 boepd, in line with guidance, representing a ~13% increase compared to the first quarter of 2023. This growth largely reflects higher production in Ghana arising from the start-up of the Jubilee South East project and the ongoing infill drilling campaign. The Company exited the quarter in a net underlift position of approximately 0.2 million barrels.GhanaProduction in Ghana averaged approximately 43,800 boepd net in the first quarter of 2024. Kosmos lifted three cargos from Ghana during the quarter, in line with guidance.At Jubilee (38.6% working interest), oil production in the first quarter averaged approximately 92,900 bopd gross with one water injector well brought on in January and two producer wells brought online in February. In the second quarter, one new producer well was brought online in April with one additional water injector well expected online by quarter end.Following the completion of the additional water injector well, the planned drilling campaign will conclude approximately six months ahead of schedule as a result of efficiencies in the drilling operations.Jubilee FPSO reliability continues to remain high at approximately 99% uptime for the first quarter. Voidage replacement for the first quarter was ~110% as a result of the elevated levels of water and gas injection.In the first quarter, Jubilee gas production net to Kosmos was approximately 6,100 boepd. The interim gas sales agreement that is currently in place for Jubilee associated gas was extended for 18 months at a price of ~$3/mmbtu. In the second quarter, the onshore gas plant that receives Jubilee gas is expected to be offline for approximately two weeks for planned routine maintenance, with the impact included in second quarter guidance.At TEN (20.4% working interest), production averaged approximately 18,600 bopd gross for the first quarter, in line with expectations. TEN FPSO reliability was consistent with Jubilee at approximately 99% uptime for the first quarter.U.S. Gulf of MexicoProduction in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico averaged approximately 14,500 boepd net (~81% oil) during the first quarter, in line with guidance.The first two wells at the Winterfell project (25% working interest) are expected online shortly. A third well is expected online in the second half of 2024. Gross production from the first phase of the Winterfell project is expected to be around 20,000 boepd when the initial three wells are online. Total gross resource at Greater Winterfell is estimated to be up to 200 million boe.The Company’s production enhancement activities for 2024 continue to make good progress with the Odd Job subsea pump project, which is planned to sustain long-term production from the field, expected online in mid-2024. At Kodiak, workover plans for the Kodiak 3 well have progressed with operations expected to commence in mid-2024. Year-end 2024 exit production from these enhancement activities is expected to be around 5,000 boepd net. The Tornado field is expected to be offline for most of the second quarter for the scheduled routine maintenance of the HP-1 floating production unit with the impact included in second quarter guidance.The Tiberius ILX project, (50% working interest and operator) continues to progress as a phased development, with project sanction expected later this year. Certain long lead items are being secured to optimize the development timeline and project costs. During the first quarter, Kosmos acquired part of Equinor\'s stake in the project to maintain an aligned partnership and now holds 50%, which is already included in the 2024 capital guidance. Around the time of project sanction, Kosmos plans to farm down to optimize its working interest to fit within the targeted 2025+ capital program. Estimated gross resource at Tiberius is approximately 100 million boe.Equatorial GuineaProduction in Equatorial Guinea averaged approximately 24,400 bopd gross and 8,400 bopd net in the first quarter. Kosmos lifted one cargo from Equatorial Guinea during the quarter, in line with guidance.The Ceiba Field and Okume Complex workover and infill drilling campaign commenced in the fourth quarter of 2023, completing one production well workover. However, as a result of previously communicated safety issues with the drilling rig, the operator terminated the rig contract in early February 2024.The partnership has now secured the Noble Venturer rig to resume the drilling campaign following the conclusion of its previous program in Ghana. The rig is expected on location around mid-year 2024 to drill and complete two infill wells in Block G and the Akeng Deep ILX prospect in Block S. Year-end 2024 exit production from the new infill wells is expected to be around 3,000 bopd net. The Akeng Deep well result is expected around the end of the year.Mauritania & SenegalThe Greater Tortue Ahmeyim liquefied natural gas (LNG) project continues to make good progress. The following milestones have been achieved:Drilling: The operator has successfully drilled and completed all four wells with expected production capacity significantly higher than what is required for first gas.Hub Terminal: Construction work is complete and Hub Terminal handed over to operations.FLNG: The vessel arrived on location offshore Mauritania/Senegal during the first quarter of 2024 and is now moored to the Hub Terminal. The partnership is continuing to work with the vessel operator to accelerate commissioning work.Subsea: The subsea workscope is progressing in line with expectations with the flowline installation now complete and final connection work ongoing.FPSO: Inspection and repair of the vessel’s fairleads is complete with the vessel now en route to the project site with mooring work to commence thereafter. Hookup and commissioning of the FPSO remain on the critical path to first gas, expected in the third quarter of 2024 with first LNG expected in the fourth quarter of 2024.The Greater Tortue Ahmeyim cargo optimization arbitration ruling is expected mid 2024.In Senegal, on Yakaar-Teranga, Kosmos continues to work closely with Senegal\'s national oil company (PETROSEN) on pre-FEED work that prioritizes cost-competitive gas for the rapidly growing economy, combined with an offshore LNG facility targeting exports into international LNG markets. Kosmos plans to farm down its working interest to approximately 25% - 33% while retaining operatorship of the project.In Mauritania, the BirAllah license expired at the end of April 2024. Kosmos continues to work closely with Mauritania\'s national oil company (SMH) and the Government of Mauritania to advance attractive gas opportunities in the country.(1) A Non-GAAP measure, see attached reconciliation of non-GAAP measure.(2) Production means net entitlement volumes. In Ghana and Equatorial Guinea, this means those volumes net to Kosmos\' working interest or participating interest and net of royalty or production sharing contract effect. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, this means those volumes net to Kosmos\' working interest and net of royalty.Conference Call and Webcast InformationKosmos will host a conference call and webcast to discuss first quarter 2024 financial and operating results today, May 7, 2024, at 10:00 a.m. Central time (11:00 a.m. Eastern time).

The Company defines EBITDAX as Net income (loss) plus (i) exploration expense, (ii) depletion, depreciation and amortization expense, (iii) equity based compensation expense, (iv) unrealized (gain) loss on commodity derivatives (realized losses are deducted and realized gains are added back), (v) (gain) loss on sale of oil and gas properties, (vi) interest (income) expense, (vii) income taxes, (viii) loss on extinguishment of debt, (ix) doubtful accounts expense and (x) similar other material items which management believes affect the comparability of operating results. The Company defines Adjusted net income (loss) as Net income (loss) adjusted for certain items that impact the comparability of results. The Company defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less Oil and gas assets, Other property, and certain other items that may affect the comparability of results and excludes non-recurring activity such as acquisitions, divestitures and National Oil Company ("NOC") financing. NOC financing refers to the amounts funded by Kosmos under the Carry Advance Agreements that the Company has in place with the national oil companies of each of Mauritania and Senegal related to the financing of the respective national oil companies’ share of certain development costs at Greater Tortue Ahmeyim. The Company defines net debt as total long-term debt less cash and cash equivalents and total restricted cash.We believe that EBITDAX, Adjusted net income (loss), Adjusted net income (loss) per share, free cash flow, Net debt and other similar measures are useful to investors because they are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in the oil and gas sector and will provide investors with a useful tool for assessing the comparability between periods, among securities analysts, as well as company by company. EBITDAX, Adjusted net income (loss), Adjusted net income (loss) per share, free cash flow, and net debt as presented by us may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.This release also contains certain forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures, including free cash flow. Due to the forward-looking nature of the aforementioned non-GAAP financial measures, management cannot reliably or reasonably predict certain of the necessary components of the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP measures, such as future impairments and future changes in working capital. Accordingly, we are unable to present a quantitative reconciliation of such forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measures. Amounts excluded from these non-GAAP measures in future periods could be significant.Forward-Looking StatementsThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

                        'With the geopolitical winds churning, the concept of cheap energy stocks has become even more critical. Basically, the window of opportunity may be fading.One major problem of course is the situation in the Middle East. While tensions have cooled relative to Iran and Israel launching missiles against each other, there’s always a chance of a miscalculation. Not too far away, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine shows no sign of abatement. With Russia also owning vast energy resources, a global supply chain disruption could easily skyrocket prices.It’s a mess. And that’s why these cheap energy stocks cynically present an upside opportunity for speculators.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsPermian Resources (PR)Rise in gasoline prices concept with double exposure of digital screen with financial chart graphs and oil pumps on a field. Oil prices and oil price predictionsSource: Golden Dayz / Shutterstock.comBased in Midland, Texas, Permian Resources (NYSE:PR) is an independent oil and natural gas company. It focuses on the development of crude oil and related liquids-rich natural gas reserves in the U.S. Its assets are primarily focused on the Delaware Basin, which is a sub-basin of the Permian Basin.Operationally, the company is perhaps best known for its massive top-line expansion. Its three-year revenue growth rate clocks in at 56.5%, above 93.98% of its peers. Also, its reasonably consistent in terms of profitability, with a robust operating margin of 47.07%.For the current fiscal year, covering experts anticipate earnings per share to reach $1.61, a sizable improvement over last year’s print of $1.24. For fiscal 2025, they’re modeling for EPS of $1.80. On the top line, revenue might reach $5.01 billion. If so, we’re talking about a growth rate of 60.4% from 2023’s haul of $3.12 billion.Lastly, the company provides a forward annual dividend yield of 3.54%. For less than $17 per share, PR is one of the cheap energy stocks to buy.Black Stone Minerals (BSM)3D rendered two black oil barrels on digital financial chart screen with yellow numbers and rising, green, falling, red arrows on black background. Oil stocksSource: stockwars / Shutterstock.comHailing from Houston, Texas, Black Stone Minerals (NYSE:BSM) owns and manages oil and natural gas mineral interests. Per its public profile, Black Stone owns mineral interests in approximately 16.8 million gross acres, nonparticipating royalty interests in 1.8 million gross acres, and overriding royalty interests in 1.6 million gross acres located in 41 states.While it may be one of the lesser-known cheap energy stocks, investors need to put BSM on their radar. For one thing, the company carries no debt on its books, affording it financial flexibility. In addition, its been profitable eight years out of the last decade. Its net margin over the past year has come out to 84.32%.Story continuesFor fiscal 2024, experts are modeling EPS to land at $1.43. To be fair, that’s disappointing relative to last year’s print of $1.88. In addition, the top line is projected to reach only $492.24 million, down almost 17% from last year. Still, it’s poised to make a recovery in fiscal 2025, with a high-side sales target of $559 million.What’s really drawing attention is the forward annual dividend yield of 9.15%. If you like speculating, BSM may be one of the cheap energy stocks to consider.Talos Energy (TALO)In the field, the oil pump in the evening, the evening silhouette of the pumping unit, the silhouette of the oil pump. Oil stocks and energy stocksSource: zhengzaishuru / Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Houston, Texas, Talos Energy (NYSE:TALO) engages in the exploration and production of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids in the U.S. and Mexico. It’s also involved in the development of carbon capture and sequestration. It’s been a slow mover this year, losing about 8% of equity value since the beginning of January.Nevertheless, despite the slow start, TALO could be an intriguing choice for cheap energy stocks. At the moment, Talos features a three-year revenue growth rate of 12.4%, below the sector median of 16.7%. That’s not great. As well, shares trade for 1.09X trailing-year revenue, which is about average.Here’s the thing. Analysts are modeling for fiscal 2024 sales to reach $1.97 billion. If so, that would represent a 35.4% increase from last year’s tally of $1.46 billion. Not only that, the high-side sales target calls for $2.06 billion.In the following year, the blue-sky sales target stands at $2.37 billion. Therefore, TALO could be surprisingly discounted relative to its anticipated top-line performance. It’s one of the cheap energy stocks to put on your watch list.Crescent Energy (CRGY)Image of an oil wells with an orange-red sky at dusk. oil stocks to buy with safe dividendsSource: ShutterstockAlso based in Houston, Crescent Energy (NYSE:CRGY) acquires, develops, and produces crude oil, natural gas and NGL reserves. Its portfolio of assets comprises mid-cycle unconventional and conventional assets in the Eagle Ford and Uinta Basins. Priced at a bit under $11 per share, CRGY ranks among the cheap energy stocks to consider.It’s not just about the low market price. On the financials, CRGY trades for only 0.57X tangible book value. In many ways, Crescent is priced lower than the sum of its parts. That seems rather odd given the rising relevance of the hydrocarbon sector. After all, geopolitical tensions are worsening, not improving.For fiscal 2024, analysts are projecting EPS to reach $1.23. That’s a decent improvement over last year’s result of $1.02. Further, fiscal 2025 could see the bottom-line print rise to $1.67. On the top line, sales could land at $2.43 billion, a modest 2.2% improvement from last year. By the following year, revenue could reach $2.51 billion.To note, the company provides a forward yield of 4.54%. Also, analysts peg shares as a moderate buy with a $16 price target, implying over 51% upside potential.GeoPark (GPRK)Image of an oil wells with a dark blue skySource: ShutterstockSpecializing in the oil and gas exploration and production (upstream) component of the hydrocarbon value chain, GeoPark (NYSE:GPRK) operates primarily in Chile, Colombia, Brazil, Argentina, Ecuador and other Latin American countries. While it’s not the most well-known idea among cheap energy stocks, it appears to be a hidden gem.Financially, the company sports a three-year revenue growth rate of 26.8%, above 68.17% of its peers. On the bottom line, GeoPark carries an operating margin of 41.47%, beating out nearly 89% of the competition. Further, GPRK trades at only 0.7X trailing-year revenue.For fiscal 2024, analysts are anticipating EPS to land at $3.15. On the top line, they’re modeling for sales of $805.65 million. Further, the blue-sky target calls for $829 million. Last year, the company posted sales of $756.6 million.Moving forward, speculators may appreciate the value that they’re getting. Beyond the revenue multiple, shares trade for only 2.82X forward earnings. Further, the company’s forward dividend yield comes in at 5.8%. With a share price of under $10, GPRK is an attractive idea for cheap energy stocks.VAALCO Energy (EGY)Illustration of oil pump jacks on sunset sky background to represent oil and gas stocksSource: ShutterstockAnother upstream specialist, VAALCO Energy (NYSE:EGY) is an independent energy company, that engages in the acquisition, exploration, development, and production of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs. Its operations are in Gabon, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea and Canada. With the geopolitical front providing a cynical catalyst, upstream players could see their demand profile rise dramatically.As circumstances currently stand, VAALCO enjoys a three-year revenue growth rate of 47%, beating out over 90% of its rivals. Also, the company’s operating margin stands at 30.92%, above 81.9% of the competition. However, it’s the forward movement that counts.Here, the situation is much tricker. Experts are anticipating EPS of 78 cents, which is above the prior year’s result of 62 cents. So far, so good. However, revenue may only reach $404.7 million. If so, that would be an 11.1% discount to last year’s haul of $455.07 million.Still, with circumstances the way they are geopolitically, VAALCO’s projections may be understated. Either way, analysts peg shares a unanimous strong buy with an $8.58 price target, implying almost 37% upside potential.Kosmos Energy (KOS)miniature oil barrel and oil well figures on top of stack of moneySource: ShutterstockHeadquartered in Dallas, Texas, Kosmos Energy (NYSE:KOS) engages in the exploration, development and production of oil and gas along the Atlantic Margins in the U.S. Per its corporate profile, Kosmos’ primary assets include production projects located in offshore Ghana, Equatorial Guinea, and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, as well as gas projects located in offshore Mauritania and Senegal.Financially, Kosmos could use some improvements. However, what may attract speculators is the value proposition. Right now, shares trade at a price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 0.47X. That’s lower than the sector median 0.91X. In addition, shares trade at only 5.61X forward earnings, below the sector median 10.17X.For fiscal 2024, analysts anticipate EPS to hit 98 cents, a decent improvement over last year’s print of 79 cents. Further fiscal 2025 could see EPS rise to $1.06. On the top line, revenue could land at $2.01 billion, up 18.1% from 2023’s tally of $1.7 billion. Further, fiscal 2025 sales could reach $2.17 billion, with a blue-sky target of $2.55 billion.Finally, analysts rate shares a consensus strong buy with a $7.69 price target, implying over 32% upside potential.

states while it may be one of the lesser known cheap energy stocks  investors need to put bsm on their radar  for one thing  the company carries no debt on its books  affording it financial flexibility  in addition  its been profitable eight years out of the last decade  its net margin over the past year has come out to 84 32  story continuesfor fiscal 2024  experts are modeling eps to land at  1 43  to be fair  that s disappointing relative to last year s print of  1 88  in addition  the top line is projected to reach only  492 24 million  down almost 17  from last year  still  it s poised to make a recovery in fiscal 2025  with a high side sales target of  559 million what s really drawing attention is the forward annual dividend yield of 9 15   if you like speculating  bsm

in the u s  and mexico  it s also involved in the development of carbon capture and sequestration  it s been a slow mover this year  losing about 8  of equity value since the beginning of january nevertheless  despite the slow start  talo could be an intriguing choice for cheap energy stocks  at the moment  talos features a three year revenue growth rate of 12 4   below the sector median of 16 7   that s not great  as well  shares trade for 1 09x trailing year revenue  which is about average here s the thing  analysts are modeling for fiscal 2024 sales to reach  1 97 billion  if so  that would represent a 35 4  increase from last year s tally of  1 46 billion  not only that  the high side sales target calls for  2 06 billion in the following year  the blue sky sales target stands at  2 37 billion  therefore  talo could be surprisingly discounted relative to its anticipated top line performance  it s one of the cheap energy stocks to put on your watch list crescent energy  crgy

ranks among the cheap energy stocks to consider it s not just about the low market price  on the financials  crgy trades for only 0 57x tangible book value  in many ways  crescent is priced lower than the sum of its parts  that seems rather odd given the rising relevance of the hydrocarbon sector  after all  geopolitical tensions are worsening  not improving for fiscal 2024  analysts are projecting eps to reach  1 23  that s a decent improvement over last year s result of  1 02  further  fiscal 2025 could see the bottom line print rise to  1 67  on the top line  sales could land at  2 43 billion  a modest 2 2  improvement from last year  by the following year  revenue could reach  2 51 billion to note  the company provides a forward yield of 4 54   also  analysts peg shares as a moderate buy

as circumstances currently stand  vaalco enjoys a three year revenue growth rate of 47   beating out over 90  of its rivals  also  the company s operating margin stands at 30 92   above 81 9  of the competition  however  it s the forward movement that counts here  the situation is much tricker  experts are anticipating eps of 78 cents  which is above the prior year s result of 62 cents  so far  so good  however  revenue may only reach  404 7 million  if so  that would be an 11 1  discount to last year s haul of  455 07 million still  with circumstances the way they are geopolitically  vaalco

                        "In this article, we discuss the 10 best affordable stocks under $10. To skip the detailed analysis of current economic conditions and experts’ outlook around them, go directly to the 5 Best Affordable Stocks Under $10.On March 20, the Federal Reserve Chairman, Jerome Powell, highlighted that the economy remains strong with substantial easing of inflation along with a robust labor market. However, he said that inflation remains relatively high compared to the Fed’s longer-run goal of 2 percent and that future inflation trends could remain uncertain. The Fed chair highlighted that the unemployment rate has been relatively low at 3.9%, and job gains have averaged around 265,000 over the last three months.Moreover, the Fed shed light on the US GDP growth and its outlook, stating that the GDP growth reached 3.2% in the fourth quarter of 2023 and predicted a slowdown in the near future. The committee is expecting a median projection of 2.1% GDP growth for 2024 and 2% for the following two years. The Fed maintained the overnight federal funds rate at the current range of 5.25% to 5.5%, and the committee still projects three rate cuts this year. Nevertheless, Jerome Powell said that it will still depend upon incoming data.Market Outlook According to ExpertsIn an interview with Yahoo Finance, chief economist of Annex Wealth Management, Brian Jacobsen, said their committee has been in discussion about “where the market narrative might shift towards,” and pointed toward the small-cap space. Jacobsen’s team also has a bullish view of the industrials, materials, and utilities sectors. He highlighted that these three sectors have underperformed and that the utilities sector could benefit a lot in case of interest rate stability or cuts. Brian Jacobsen said that the materials and industrials sectors are more “cyclically oriented”, and if manufacturing gets out of the “long hibernation” it has experienced, both sectors could even outperform for three years.Despite the underperformance of the materials and industrial sectors compared to the broader market in 2023, both of them are competing fairly well in 2024. Materials Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLB) has been up 8.5% year-to-date, compared to the S&P 500 10.08% gain as of March 27. On the other hand, the Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLI) has outperformed the S&P 500 with an 11.61% year-to-date gain.Jeremy Siegel, Wharton School finance professor, told CNBC on March 27 that he is still optimistic about the US economy, and it isn’t showing any signs of weakness. He said that he wouldn’t be surprised about a little correction in the market, but the current bull market is strong and has “ways to go”. Professor Siegel also commented on Morgan Stanley’s executive chairman James Morgan's statement about not being shocked if the Fed doesn’t cut rates for the whole year. He said it is possible, but he thinks it is unlikely and “against the odds.”Story continuesOn the other hand, Elizabeth Evans, Managing Partner of Evans May Wealth, said in a CNBC interview on March 27 that the market is due for a pullback, and her company is suggesting the clients take a time-out and make some adjustments.

                        "In this piece, we will take a look at the 13 oil stocks with the biggest upside. If you want to skip our overview of the oil sector and some recent news, then you can skip ahead to the 5 Oil Stocks with Biggest Upside. When we talk about investing in major sectors of the stock market, such as oil stocks, the number of equities that are available for trading on major indexes runs into the hundreds. This means that selecting the right stocks to invest in becomes a tedious process that requires an investor to patiently work through copious amounts of financial data to see whether a share price is justified by a firm's underlying models.Naturally, this is why the finance industry exists, with the sell side sector hiring teams to analyze stocks and write recommendations. Some such firms include banks such as JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), and The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS). These banks issue hundreds of stock notes each year, and often formulate lists of top firms in sectors such as oil to narrow down potential star stock performers.Oil stocks in particular have been at the center of news coverage for the past couple of years, and despite significant demand up and downswings in the sector, their long term returns still resemble those that are characteristic of stable sectors. For instance, when we look at the five year performance of the S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production Select Industry Index, the index is up by 16%, a growth that discounts the effects of dividends in providing investors a larger bang for their buck.In fact for the oil industry, even though 2023 was a boon in terms of revenue and high profits due to elevated gas prices stemming from the Russian invasion of Ukraine, it saw a sector that was still reeling from the effects of post pandemic global shutdowns and travel restrictions. These had ensured that the demand for oil was cut down significantly, and as the implications became clear, the same S&P oil index that is up by 16% over the past five years dropped by more than 30% over the course of a single summer month.Just before this turmoil hit, i.e. in June 2022, Goldman Sachs had started to share its favored oil stocks which the bank's analyst Neil Mehta outlined had the potential for the greatest share price upside. The list was accompanied by a note that identified companies slated to benefit from a boom in global commodity demand and prices right when the global energy industry was undergoing a significant re shift on the supply side and fuels such as liquefied natural gas (LNG) boomed as an alternative to cheap Russian gas.Story continuesMehta explained that the list of companies his teams had identified carried the potential of generating strong cash flows and potentially experiencing significant upside revisions down the road. He added that in case of long term crude oil prices hovering around $90, the top oil stocks could provide attractive valuations and end up being important components of a beta barbell investing strategy that allows an investor to focus on high and low risk stocks to strike an adequate balance between hedging a portfolio and seeking return.Since then, Goldman Sachs has mostly stuck with its oil price forecast, which is important since the high cash flow companies that the analyst identified are said to be capable of using stable prices to generate high cash flow. Cash flow is the actual money that is available to a firm for its operations and investor returns, and the bank's latest oil price forecast sits at $87 after a $2 raise in February 2024.With the outlook of oil still rosy despite a slow Chinese recovery, we decided to look at the top oil stocks with the biggest upside. Some notable picks are Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), Hess Corporation (NYSE:HES), and Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD).13 Oil Stocks with Biggest UpsideAn oil derrick in the North Sea, revealing the scope of the company's drilling operations.Our MethodologyTo make our list of the oil stocks with the highest upside, we ranked Goldman Sachs's top oil stock picks in 2022 and 2024 by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in 2023's December quarter.

For the oil stocks from 2022, the share price performance from March 2022 is shared.For these oil stocks with the largest upside, we used we used hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).

It also sets the stage for penny oil stocks to rise dramatically as Middle East tensions ratchet higher.The energy sector has been a particularly strong performer this year. According to Charles Schwab, it is expected to continue to outperform the market overall. Oil prices are surging as I write this article. Israel has launched missile strikes against Iran. The result was that per barrel oil prices spiked by $3 on the day. It also sets the stage for further escalation that promises to raise prices higher yet again.That combination of factors makes penny oil stocks particularly attractive. Penny stocks in general have high potential to produce outsized gains — those in the oil sector look particularly strong at the moment.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBaytex Energy (BTE)Crude oil tanker and LPG Loading in port at sea view from above.

The company explores, develops and acquires oil and natural gas properties in Canada and the United States.Baytex Energy develops oil and natural gas properties  primarily in Texas and Alberta. This stock makes particular sense given that the company increased production by 16% in 2023. that production was overwhelmingly crude oil based. The company’s daily production was 85% crude oil and 15% natural gas.In other words, Baytex Energy is well positioned to take advantage of rising oil prices at the moment. The company’s strong production metrics were also above guidance. It is yet another piece of evidence suggestive of the investment worthiness of a BTE shares overall.Otherwise, the company also invests 50% of a free cash flows into shareholder returns. Overall, Baytex Energy strikes me as a well-run firm that is particularly well positioned as oil prices spike.The consensus opinion is that BTE shares should more than double over the next year.Kosmos Energy (KOS)Production operator communicate between central control room by using radio to operate ball valve at offshore oil and gas processing platform for control gases and liquid crude oil process. Energy Stocks. Bargain energy stocks for JuneSource: Oil and Gas Photographer / Shutterstock.comKosmos Energy (NYSE:KOS) won’t release its Q1 results until early May, but I expect they’ll be strong. There are currently multiple reasons to consider investing in the oil penny stock.First of all, institutional interest in Kosmos Energy is currently strong. Several prominent institutional investors have recently increased their stake in KOS shares substantially. That suggests that those firms see a potential price bump upcoming in early May. Institutional investment activity is a strong indicator of price direction. Such firms have substantial resources with which to influence the market. Those recent moves should increase investor confidence in KOS shares as bullishness increases in the energy sector overall.Story continuesAnother positive factor to note is that Kosmos Energy is becoming more efficient. The company has recently been able to increase the return on capital employed. Those higher capital returns should trickle down and manifest as higher share prices. It is another relatively inexpensive oil stock with the potential to rise by 50% or more.Amplify Energy (AMPY)photo of large oil well infrastructure in a field at sunsetSource: ShutterstockAmplify Energy (NYSE:AMPY) released earnings in March showing strong performance. That is a primary reason to consider investing in the inexpensive oil stock.The company reported revenues of $78.99 million whereas Wall Street had expected $76.22 million. Although the 3.6% beat was impressive, it was in earnings that the company truly shined. Analysts had expected Amplify Energy to provide earnings per share of 18 cents. Instead, the company provided an EPS of $1.07 in the period.Consider investing in Amplify Energy as it leans into stronger prices moving forward. The company managed to derive $43.6 million of net income at per barrel oil prices near $78 during Q4. Prices have since increased suggesting that Amplify Energy’s upcoming earnings will potentially move higher again.The forecast price range for AMPY stock is tightly bound, ranging from $9 at the low end to $9.50 at the high end. That’s fairly reassuring given that shares currently trade for $6.75. It implies that there is very little volatility moving forward within the expectation of strong returns.On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

                        'DALLAS, April 29, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Kosmos Energy (NYSE/LSE: KOS) ("Kosmos" or the "Company") announced today that it has successfully re-financed its reserve-based lending ("RBL") facility extending the maturity by approximately three years, with the RBL facility’s final maturity now in December 2029.In conjunction with the spring re-determination, the total RBL facility size has been increased to $1.35 billion (from $1.25 billion) with current commitments of approximately $1.2 billion. Discussions with additional potential lenders are ongoing and are expected to increase commitments later this year towards the RBL facility size. $800 million is currently drawn against the RBL facility with the first amortization payment scheduled for April 1, 2027.The RBL facility is secured against the Company’s production assets in Ghana and Equatorial Guinea with the Company’s assets in the US Gulf of Mexico and Mauritania & Senegal remaining unencumbered. The resulting borrowing base following the spring re-determination significantly exceeds the RBL facility size. The interest margin payable on the RBL increased slightly compared to the previous facility, reflecting the current banking market environment, with the new interest margin on the RBL facility commencing at 400 basis points above the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") for the first two years.As part of the RBL facility re-financing, the Company has downsized its revolving credit facility ("RCF") from $250 million to approximately $165 million with some banks transferring their commitments from the RCF to the RBL in anticipation of the RCF maturing at the end of 2024.Neal Shah, Chief Financial Officer, said "Re-financing the RBL facility is another important step to optimize Kosmos’ capital structure and proactively address our debt maturities. With the re-financing of the RBL and the recent convertible bond issuance, we have no maturities until 2026 and lower interest expense going forward. We thank our bank group for their continued support as we grow the company."About Kosmos EnergyKosmos is a full-cycle, deepwater, independent oil and gas exploration and production company focused along the offshore Atlantic Margins.

                        'DALLAS, March 04, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Kosmos Energy Ltd. (NYSE/LSE: KOS) ("Kosmos" or the "Company") announced today that it intends to offer, subject to market and other conditions, $300 million aggregate principal amount of its convertible senior notes due 2030 (the "notes") in a private placement. The Company also expects to grant the initial purchasers an option to purchase up to an additional $45 million aggregate principal amount of notes, for settlement within a 13-day period beginning on, and including, the date on which the notes are first issued. The notes will be senior, unsecured obligations of the Company. The notes will rank pari passu with the Company’s existing senior notes and the Company’s revolving credit facility. The notes will be guaranteed (i) on a senior, unsecured basis by certain of the Company’s existing subsidiaries that guarantee on a senior basis the Company’s revolving credit facility and the Company’s existing senior notes, and (ii) on a subordinated, unsecured basis by certain of the Company’s existing subsidiaries that borrow under or guarantee the Company’s commercial debt facility and guarantee on a subordinated basis the Company’s revolving credit facility and the Company’s existing senior notes. Upon conversions of the notes, the Company will satisfy its conversion obligation by paying cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the notes to be converted, and paying or delivering, as the case may be, cash, shares of the Company’s common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Company’s common stock, at the Company’s election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of its conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the notes to be converted. The interest rate, conversion rate and other terms of the notes are to be determined upon pricing of the offering.The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the sale of the notes to (i) repay a portion of outstanding indebtedness under the Company’s commercial debt facility; (ii) pay the cost of the capped call transactions described below; and (iii) pay fees and expenses related to the offering.In connection with the pricing of the notes, the Company expects to enter into privately negotiated capped call transactions with one or more of the initial purchasers of the notes or their respective affiliates and/or other financial institutions (the "option counterparties"). The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce potential dilution to the Company’s common stock upon any conversion of the notes and/or offset any cash payments the Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap. If the initial purchasers of the notes exercise their option to purchase additional notes, the Company expects to enter into additional capped call transactions with the option counterparties, and expects to use a portion of the net proceeds from the additional notes to pay the cost of such additional capped call transactions.In connection with establishing their initial hedges of the capped call transactions, the Company expects the option counterparties or their respective affiliates to enter into various derivative transactions with respect to the Company’s common stock concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the notes, and may unwind these various derivative transactions and purchase the Company’s common stock in open market transactions shortly after the pricing of the notes. This activity could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of the Company’s common stock or the notes at that time.In addition, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to the Company’s common stock and/or purchasing or selling the Company’s common stock or other securities of the Company in secondary market transactions following the pricing of the notes and prior to the maturity of the notes (and are likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of notes). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of the Company’s common stock or the notes, which could affect the ability of noteholders to convert the notes and, to the extent the activity occurs during any observation period related to a conversion of the notes, it could affect the number of shares and value of the consideration that noteholders will receive upon conversion of the notes.The offering is being made to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). The offer and sale of the notes, the guarantees and any shares of the Company\'s common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act, or under any state securities laws, and the notes and such shares may not be offered or sold in the United States except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws.This announcement does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy the notes in the offering, nor shall there be any sale of such notes in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction.Forward-Looking StatementsThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

A: Andrew Inglis, CEO, stated that Kosmos Energy aligns with host countries' needs regardless of government changes. In Senegal, discussions with the new government have been constructive, focusing on accelerating gas resource development to benefit the Senegalese economy. Day-to-day operations remain unchanged, and the company is working on bringing Phase 1 online later this year.Q: What are the prospects for increased activity in Equatorial Guinea given the significant undeveloped resources there? A: Andrew Inglis, CEO, mentioned that Equatorial Guinea has a lot of undeveloped resources. The current focus is on infill drilling, which is expected to sustain production levels. Additionally, the King Deep well could potentially provide significant growth if successful.Q: What are the next steps or milestones for the FPSO to achieve first gas? A: Andrew Inglis, CEO, explained that the FPSO is on track with significant progress made. The next steps include mooring, commissioning work, hookup of risers, and introducing gas to the FLNG vessel, followed by the cooldown process and starting LNG production.Q: Can you provide an update on the performance of the Jubilee field in Ghana, especially in light of recent well completions? A: Andrew Inglis, CEO, reported that the Jubilee field's production was strong, with recent well completions contributing positively.

A: Nealesh Shah, CFO, explained that the convertible bond issuance was strategic to manage the maturity schedule effectively and optimize access to capital at a lower cost. This step helps clear the runway for the next couple of years, allowing the company to focus on executing its business plan without balance sheet concerns.Q: What is the strategy for deleveraging, especially with the anticipated free cash flow inflection? A: Nealesh Shah, CFO, stated that Kosmos aims to reduce leverage to below 1.5 times in a normalized oil price environment. The initial focus will be on paying down the reserve-based lending (RBL) facility, which is the highest cost debt. This is a priority for the allocation of the anticipated free cash flow.For the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

                        "If we want to find a potential multi-bagger, often there are underlying trends that can provide clues. In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. Speaking of which, we noticed some great changes in Kosmos Energy's (NYSE:KOS) returns on capital, so let's have a look.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Kosmos Energy:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.11 = US$468m ÷ (US$4.9b - US$555m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).Therefore, Kosmos Energy has an ROCE of 11%. In isolation, that's a pretty standard return but against the Oil and Gas industry average of 15%, it's not as good. See our latest analysis for Kosmos Energy roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Kosmos Energy compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Kosmos Energy  for free.What Does the ROCE Trend For Kosmos Energy Tell Us?Kosmos Energy has broken into the black (profitability) and we're sure it's a sight for sore eyes. While the business was unprofitable in the past, it's now turned things around and is earning 11% on its capital. While returns have increased, the amount of capital employed by Kosmos Energy has remained flat over the period. With no noticeable increase in capital employed, it's worth knowing what the company plans on doing going forward in regards to reinvesting and growing the business. So if you're looking for high growth, you'll want to see a business's capital employed also increasing.The Key TakeawayIn summary, we're delighted to see that Kosmos Energy has been able to increase efficiencies and earn higher rates of return on the same amount of capital. And given the stock has remained rather flat over the last five years, there might be an opportunity here if other metrics are strong. That being the case, research into the company's current valuation metrics and future prospects seems fitting.Story continuesLike most companies, Kosmos Energy does come with some risks, and we've found 3 warning signs  that you should be aware of.While Kosmos Energy isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

                        'Budget conscious investors and people with not a lot of capital need not worry. There are plenty of low priced stocks available to buy that have the potential for exponential growth. A lot of analysts give their highest ratings to under-$10 stocks. Many penny stocks, which are securities trading for under $5 a share, also have top marks from analysts despite their low price.Finding cheaply priced and attractively valued stocks of well-run companies can be the key to an investor’s long-term success. Often times, it is these stocks that have the most growth potential and earn the biggest returns over the long run. The analysts ratings placed on these stocks can help investors determine if they are worth an allocation of capital and the right price at which to take a position.Here is Wall Street favorites: Three under-$10 stocks with strong buy ratings for May 2024.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsUnder-$10 Stocks: TeraWulf (WULF)Dinosaur figurine holding a Bitcoin (BTC) concept coin between its teethSource: shutterstock.com/Maestro-0111TeraWulf (NASDAQ:WULF) might be familiar to cryptocurrency bulls. The company is an environmentally friendly Bitcoin (BTC-USD) miner that says its aim is to accelerate “the transition to a zero-carbon future.” Currently, TeraWulf trades right around $2 per share, making it a penny stock. Over the last 12 months, WULF stock has risen 24%. However, the share price today is 74% lower than where it traded five years ago.Despite its penny stock status and uneven performance, six Wall Street analysts rate WULF stock a strong buy. The median price target on the shares is $3.62, implying nearly 80% upside from current levels. Clearly, analysts like that TeraWulf is focused on responsible Bitcoin mining and making the process better for the environment. One of the biggest knocks on crypto miners is that they consume an excessive amounts of power.Kinross Gold Corp. (KGC)Cellphone with business logo of Canadian mining company Kinross Gold Corp. on screen in front of webpage.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comKinross Gold Corp. (NYSE:KGC) is another stock under $10 that analysts rate highly. Currently trading at just under $8 per share, Kinross has been riding the bull rally in gold’s price to new heights. KGC stock has increased nearly 50% in the past 12 months, including a 32% gain this year. Analysts see more growth ahead for the Canadian gold miner, especially as the price of bullion marches higher.A total of 10 Wall Street analysts rate KGC stock a strong buy with a median price target that is 6% above current levels. That’s impressive coming after a big rally in the stock price. Kinross has been doing its best to make hay while the sun shines, and as the price of gold hit an all-time high of $2,431.55 an ounce in April of this year. While gold’s price has pulled back a bit in recent weeks, its price is still trading close to the $2,400.00 mark.Story continuesKosmos Energy (KOS)A Koss Porta Pro headset in a box.Source: SiljeAO / Shutterstock.comKosmos Energy (NYSE:KOS) is an upstream oil company based in Dallas, Texas. Among oil concerns, Kosmos is pretty small. KOS stock currently trades at less than $6 a share, giving the company a market capitalization of less than $3 billion. The stock hasn’t been setting the world on fire lately. Year to date, the share price is down 13%. Over five years, the stock is down 9%. Yet analysts remain bullish on this oil producer.Currently, six Wall Street analysts rate KOS stock a strong buy and have a median price target of $8.12, which is 38% above where the shares are changing hands at present. Analysts seems to like the opportunity Kosmos Energy has with the development of several mine sites around the world, including in Ghana, Equatorial Guinea, and the Gulf of Mexico. In time, the share price should catch-up to the company’s growth plans.

                        "Kosmos Energy Ltd. (NYSE:KOS) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript May 7, 2024Kosmos Energy Ltd. beats earnings expectations. Reported EPS is $0.1902, expectations were $0.15. Kosmos Energy Ltd. isn’t one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here).Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, good morning, and welcome to the Kosmos Energy First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Jamie Buckland, VP Investor Relations. Please go ahead.Jamie Buckland: Thank you, operator, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. This morning we issued our first quarter 2024 earnings release. This release and the slide presentation to accompany today's call are available on the Investors page of our website. Joining me on the call today, to go through the material, are Andy Inglis, Chairman and CEO; and Neal Shah, CFO. During today's presentation, we will make forward-looking statements that refer to our estimates, plans and expectations. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially, due to factors that we note in this presentation and in our UK and SEC filings. Please refer to our annual report, stock exchange announcement and SEC filings for more details. These documents are available on our website. And at this time, I'll turn the call over to Andy.Andy Inglis: Thanks, Jamie, and good morning and afternoon to everyone. Thank you for joining us today for our first quarter results call. It's been an active start to the year for Kosmos, and I'll start today's presentation looking at the operational and financial momentum we've built in the first few months of the year. Neal will then walk you through this quarter's financial results before I look ahead to the catalysts for the remainder of the year. We'll then open up the call for Q&A. Starting on slide 3 with the delivery of our major projects. Kosmos had a strong first quarter with significant progress towards our goal of growing production by around 50% from the second half of 2022 to the end of 2024. In Ghana, all the planned 2024 Jubilee production wells are online with one water injection well expected online later this quarter.Following completion of this well, the planned drilling campaign will conclude approximately six months ahead of schedule as a result of efficiencies in the drilling operations. In the Gulf of Mexico, oil production of Winterfell is expected to begin shortly from the initial two wells. Our third well is due to come online later this year increasing expected gross production to around 20,000 barrels of oil per day. In Mauritania and Senegal, the Tortue project continues to move towards first gas with several key milestones achieved already this year. I'll talk more about our progress on these projects later in the presentation. Looking further ahead, we continue to advance our next phase of growth projects. Long lead items are being secured for time various to optimize the development time line and project costs.Story continuesWe have also secured a two year license extension for Yakaar Teranga. While we see continued growth as an important part of the Company's future, as I said last quarter, it will be selective and more measured in the coming years, consistent with sustained annual CapEx of around $550 million per year. That is targeted from 2025 onwards. On the financial side of the business, we enhanced the Company's financial resilience with the convertible bond issuance and the RBL refinancing. Neal will talk about these in more detail shortly. The transactions improved liquidity and extended our near-term maturities. The free cash flow inflection point we've been anticipating of around $100 million to $150 million per quarter once our development projects come online is now only a few months away.I'll now talk through the operational progress across our different business units starting in Ghana on slide 4. Jubilee production in the first quarter was around 93,000 barrels of oil per day growth, almost 30% higher than the first quarter last year. This reflects the progress made from both the startup of the Jubilee Southeast project and the ongoing infill drilling program. Jubilee FPSO reliability, continues to remain high at approximately 99% uptime for the first quarter. Moody's replacement was also strong in the quarter, around 110% as a result of high levels of water and gas injection. Gross Jubilee gas sales for the quarter was around 16,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Recently, the partnership agreed an 18 month extension to the Jubilee gas sales agreement for approximately $3 per MMBtu.In the second quarter, there is some planned maintenance of the onshore plant, which receives the Jubilee gas. And this is reflected in the 2Q guidance. On TEN, gross production at 18,600 barrels of oil per day was in line with expectations, with high FPSO uptime of around 99% similar to Jubilee. Turning to Slide 5. Production in the Gulf of Mexico for the quarter, was approximately 14,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day net, in line with guidance. At Winterfell where Kosmos has a 25% working interest, first oil from the two initial wells is expected shortly with another well expected online, in the second half of the year. Gross production when all three wells were online is expected to be around 20,000 barrels of oil equivalent, per day.We estimate total gross resource across greater Winterfell about 200 million barrels of oil equivalent, providing significant future follow-on potential. To enhance existing production, we continue to invest selectively in high return projects like the Odd Job subsea pump and Kodiak workover, both expected to finish around the middle of the year. The combined uplift from both of these projects is expected to contribute around 5,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day net Kosmos’s year end exit rate. The tornado field is expected to be offline for most of the second quarter, for scheduled routine maintenance of the HP-1 floating production unit, which has been factored into our guidance for the quarter. On Tiberius, where Kosmos is operator we acquired part of Equinor’s interest during the first quarter to maintain an aligned partnership.A drilling platform in the middle of the ocean, showing the oil and gas exploration process.We now hold a 50% interest in the project, which is already included in our 2024 capital guidance. This phased developments as subsea tieback to Oxy-operated Lucius platform is progressing. The project sanction expected later in the year. Certain long-lead items have been secured to optimize the development time line and project costs. Around the time of project sanction, Kosmos plans to farm down to optimize our working interest to fit within our targeted capital program for 2025 and beyond. Please turn to Slide 6. Production in Equatorial Guinea averaged approximately 24,400 barrels of oil per day gross and 8,400 net in the first quarter. Kosmos lifted one cargo from Equatorial Guinea during the quarter in line with guidance. In early February, as previously communicated, the operator pause the Ceiba and Okume drilling campaign as a result of safety issues, with the previous rig.The partnership has now secured the Noble Venturer to resume the drilling campaign with a rig expected on-location midyear. The rig is scheduled to drill and complete two infill wells in Block G, before moving to drill the Akeng Deep ILX prospects in Block S. The new infill wells are expected to add around 3,000 barrels of oil per day net to Kosmos at year end exit rate. The result of the Akeng Deep well which is targeting gross resource of around 180 million barrels is expected around the end of the year. Turning to Slide 7. The Greater Tortue Ahmeyim Project continues to move towards first gas with significant progress across all work streams so far this year, with first gas expected in the third quarter and first LNG expected in the fourth quarter.The floating LNG vessel arrived in the first quarter as being moored to hub terminal.. The partnership is now working with the vessel operator to accelerate commissioning. The subsea work is progressing in line with expectations with a flowline installation complete and final connection work ongoing. Inspection and repair of the FPSO fairly is now complete and the vessel has left Tenerife and his own route to the project site more in work to commence thereafter. Hookup and commissioning of the FPSO remains on the critical path, first gas which is expected in the first quarter. I'll now turn it over to Neil to take you through the financials.Neal Shah: Thanks, Andy. Turning to slide 8, which looks at the first quarter. Production in the quarter of approximately 66,700 barrels of oil equivalent per day, net was an increase of around 13% compared to the same quarter last year. Costs for the quarter were within or slightly better than guidance leading to the earnings beat against consensus. CapEx for the first quarter was $286 million which was in line with guidance and is largely made up of the Ghana drilling campaign and the progress made on both Winterfell and on Tortue. As previously communicated, we expect the majority of this year's CapEx be in the first half of this year with the free cash flow inflection that Andy talked about in his opening slide expected as the development projects complete and production ramps up throughout the end of the year.Turning to slide 9, which looks at our debt maturities. We took two important steps this year to further enhance the financial resilience of the company. First, was the convertible bond issuance in March which proactively replaces the liquidity from the $250 million undrawn RCF is due to expire at the end of this year. The convertible also lowered our overall interest expense as we paid down a portion of our RBL with the available proceeds which is our highest cost debt. We've also seen the yields on our high-yield bonds tightened which should help pricing when we come to think about potentially refinancing those in the future. To limit future equity dilution, we purchased a capped call which means there will be no dilution until the shares get to almost $11 per share.We also took the option to cash settle the principal amount raised which also reduces any future dilution. The second important step was the refinancing of our reserve-based lending facility with in terms of broadly in line with the previous facility. The overall facility size increased to $1.35 billion from $1.25 billion with current commitments of around $1.2 billion. Through the refinancing we have extended the final maturity by approximately three years. At the same time, we have had some of our banks transfer their commitment to the RBL from the RCF, which as I mentioned expires at the end of this year. I'd like to thank our banks for their continued support as we continue to grow the company. The chart on the right shows the impact of both the convertible bond issuance and the RBL refinancing on the maturity schedule.We now have no near-term debt and the staggered maturity schedule from 2026 onwards. As we reach the expected free cash flow inflection point plan to continue to prioritize paying down the RBL, reducing the amounts in the dark blue on the chart on the right. We continue to target leverage below 1.5 times at mid-cycle oil prices with deleveraging expected commence once revenues from 4Q to start up later in the year. With that I'll hand it back to Andy to conclude today's presentation.Andy Inglis: Thank you. Turning now to slide 10. As I said in my opening remarks, it was a busy first quarter and we have achieved a lot in just three months. The operational financial momentum we built has rolled into the same quarter with several milestones already achieved and more to come in the near future. The graphic on this slide shows a rich portfolio of catalysts throughout the year across all our business units. They contribute towards our goal for year end exit rate of 90,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and free cash flow inflection points combined we believe these will create significant value for our shareholders. Thank you and I'd now like to turn the call over to the operator to open the session questions.See also11 Best Delivery Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds and16 Best US Stocks To Invest In Under $10.To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.",

                        'DALLAS, March 06, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Kosmos Energy Ltd. (NYSE/LSE: KOS) ("Kosmos" or the "Company"), announced today that it has priced a private offering of $350 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.125% convertible senior notes due 2030 (the "notes"), which represents a $50 million increase in principal amount from the previously announced offering size. The Company also granted the initial purchasers an option to purchase up to an additional $50 million aggregate principal amount of notes, for settlement within a 13-day period beginning on, and including, the date on which the notes are first issued. The offering is expected to close on March 8, 2024, subject to customary closing conditions.The notes will be senior, unsecured obligations of the Company. The notes will rank pari passu with the Company’s existing senior notes and the Company’s revolving credit facility. The notes will be guaranteed (i) on a senior, unsecured basis by certain of the Company’s existing subsidiaries that guarantee on a senior basis the Company’s revolving credit facility and the Company’s existing senior notes, and (ii) on a subordinated, unsecured basis by certain of the Company’s existing subsidiaries that borrow under or guarantee the Company’s commercial debt facility and guarantee on a subordinated basis the Company’s revolving credit facility and the Company’s existing senior notes. Upon conversions of the notes, the Company will satisfy its conversion obligation by paying cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the notes to be converted, and paying or delivering, as the case may be, cash, shares of the Company’s common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Company’s common stock, at the Company’s election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of its conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the notes to be converted. The notes will have an initial conversion rate of 142.4501 shares of the Company’s common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes (which is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances). This is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $7.02 per share. The initial conversion price represents a premium of approximately 30.0% to the $5.40 per share closing price of the Company’s common stock on The New York Stock Exchange on March 5, 2024.The notes will accrue interest at an annual rate of 3.125%, payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on September 15, 2024. The notes will mature on March 15, 2030, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. Prior to December 15, 2029, the notes will be convertible at the option of the holders only upon the occurrence of specified events, and thereafter until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, the notes will be convertible at any time. In the event of certain tax law changes, the Company may redeem the notes in whole, but not in part. In addition, the Company may redeem for cash all or any portion of the notes (subject to a partial redemption limitation), at the Company’s option, on or after March 22, 2027 and prior to the 41st scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, if the last reported sale price per share of the Company\'s common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price for a specified period of time. The redemption price will be equal to the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date.Story continuesThe Company estimates that the net proceeds from this offering will be approximately $340.4 million (or approximately $389.0 million if the initial purchasers exercise in full their option to purchase additional notes), after deducting discounts payable to the initial purchasers. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the sale of the notes to (i) repay a portion of outstanding indebtedness under the Company’s commercial debt facility; (ii) pay the cost of the capped call transactions described below, using net proceeds of approximately $43.6 million; and (iii) pay fees and expenses related to the offering.In connection with the pricing of the notes, the Company entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions with certain of the initial purchasers of the notes or their respective affiliates and certain other financial institutions (the "option counterparties"). The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce potential dilution to the Company’s common stock upon any conversion of the notes and/or offset any cash payments the Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap. The cap price of the capped call transactions will initially be $10.80, which represents a premium of 100.0% above the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock on The New York Stock Exchange on March 5, 2024, and is subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. If the initial purchasers of the notes exercise their option to purchase additional notes, the Company expects to enter into additional capped call transactions with the option counterparties and use a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of the additional notes to pay the cost of such additional capped call transactions.In connection with establishing their initial hedges of the capped call transactions, the Company expects the option counterparties or their respective affiliates to enter into various derivative transactions with respect to the Company’s common stock concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the notes, and may unwind these various derivative transactions and purchase the Company’s common stock in open market transactions shortly after the pricing of the notes. This activity could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of the Company’s common stock or the notes at that time.In addition, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to the Company’s common stock and/or purchasing or selling the Company’s common stock or other securities of the Company in secondary market transactions following the pricing of the notes and prior to the maturity of the notes (and are likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of notes). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of the Company’s common stock or the notes, which could affect the ability of noteholders to convert the notes and, to the extent the activity occurs during any observation period related to a conversion of the notes, it could affect the number of shares and value of the consideration that noteholders will receive upon conversion of the notes.The offering is being made to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). The offer and sale of the notes, the guarantees and any shares of the Company\'s common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act, or under any state securities laws, and the notes and such shares may not be offered or sold in the United States except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws.This announcement does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy the notes in the offering, nor shall there be any sale of such notes in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction.Forward-Looking StatementsThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
