                        "Shopify (SHOP) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this cloud-based commerce company have returned +15.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.7% change. The Zacks Internet - Services industry, to which Shopify belongs, has gained 3.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Shopify is expected to post earnings of $0.20 per share, indicating a change of +42.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.9% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $0.94 points to a change of +27% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -3.8%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.28 indicates a change of +36.1% from what Shopify is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.1%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Shopify is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Story continuesThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for SHOP _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Shopify, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $2 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +18.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $8.51 billion and $10.14 billion estimates indicate +20.5% and +19.2% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryShopify reported revenues of $1.86 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +23.4%. EPS of $0.20 for the same period compares with $0.01 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.84 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.36%. The EPS surprise was +25%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Shopify is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Shopify. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

                        "On today's episode of Market Domination, Yahoo Finance's Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton break down the trading week's biggest stories from Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk's pay package to tumbling cruise line stocks.The major indexes (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) are mixed after June's consumer sentiment data hit its lowest level since November. CFRA Research chief investment strategist Sam Stovall is concerned that markets may have \"to endure another decline\" before the following year sees substantial market gains.Tesla shareholders approved CEO Elon Musk's controversial $56 billion compensation package at Thursday's shareholder meeting. Financial analyst and YouTuber \"Meet Kevin\" Kevin Paffrath was in favor of Musk's pay package, explaining, \"the deal was made in 2018 and it was very public... Frankly, if that same deal was made today at those prices then, everybody would look at that as a shareholder and go — well, at least 70% like we had then — 'Of course, we're going to support if you can move the market capitalization of this stock essentially exponentially. Of course, we're going to support paying for you.' So receiving that and then being frustrated about Elon in the short term, I don't think is fair. I think it hits on an element of justice.\"As the summer travel season heats up, top cruise line stocks (CCL, RCL, NCLH, VIK) dipped in Friday's session after Bank of America analysts found cruise prices to be \"modestly softer\" in June.On the airline side, issues with Boeing (BA) are preventing companies from accessing new planes, stunting growth amid high demand. Peter McNally, Third Bridge Global's Head of Industrials, Materials, and Energy Sector, explains, \"companies like United (UAL) who've got very ambitious targets out to 2026 that they've had to temper that a bit... It doesn't seem like Boeing's problems are going to be sorted anytime soon, and it's not like Airbus (AIR.PA) can go any faster than they already are.\"Shares of Shopify (SHOP) rose after Evercore ISI's Mark Mahaney upgraded the e-commerce company to Outperform from In Line, citing an attractive entry point for investors following a slight decline in the share price. Tempus AI (TEM) shares also popped after making its trading debut on the Nasdaq via an IPO.This post was written by Melanie RiehlVideo TranscriptHello and welcome to market domination.I'm Julie High and that's Josh Lift in live from our New York City headquarters.We are giving you the ultimate investing play book to help tune out the noise and make the right moves for your money.And here's your headline blitz getting you up to speed one hour before the closing bell rings on wall.Story continuesWhen you look at the Tester story, autonomous FSD, I can argue.It's one of the best A I plays in the market.When you look at next 234 years, this is just the start of the next chapter of the next book.Is, it must call it in the t of Grosser.I think it is one of the best disruptive names in the world.It doesn't appear that the technology in this A I story is approaching uh uh uh a level where it's going to solve.It looks like it's still morphing into other things.The only thing sustaining current economic growth is a wealth effect from the bull market and consumer spending.The asymmetries of risk are that the economy can do much worse than consensus far more easily than it can do much better than consensus one hour to go until the market close.So let's take a look at the major averages right now.We are losing a little bit of steam today after the rally that we've been seeing in recent days right now, the dow off by nearly 100 points, it off by about a quarter of 1%.The S and P 500 after four consecutive record closes is not on track to repeat that feat today down about 1/10 of 1% or so, NASDAQ though, maybe we've got right now.It's very little change.So we'll see where it trends in the last hour of trading.And by the way, the NASDAQ return over the past five days looking like here better than 3% looking over at some of the components of the NASDAQ.You know, it's been so interesting.We keep talking about this broadening of the market.Uh We talked to our Josh Schafer yesterday that a lot of Wall Street stra just are calling for that broadening in the second half of the year.But we have seen really some of the large cap tech continue to lead some of the gains that we have been watching.Here's the Weekly.Look, here, you look at an NVIDIA of 9.2% Apple of nearly 8% Microsoft gaining and you see what's been going on there.Another name I wanted to call out here is Netflix up about two and three quarters percent today.And trading at a, uh, looks like maybe on track for a record close in today's session.We're gonna keep an eye on that to see if it makes it there the year to date return for Netflix some 38%.We also continue to watch the sort of market cap race if you will here, uh, for many of these companies, um not seeing the market cap here come up on this one, see if it will, if we switch it around a little bit.No, it's not coming up.But anyway, you see what these guys have been doing on a daily basis here.There's the market cap.So we've got a Microsoft back in the top position, Apple now in number two, NVIDIA and number three, but we continue to have that sort of neck and neck race uh for market cap between those tech giants, Josh.All right, Julie stocks are fighting for gains today as consumer sentiment tumbling in June.This comes as the S and P 500 NASDAQ have each nailed record closes this week for more on the latest market moves.Let's welcome in Sam Stonewall CFR, a research Chief Investment strategist, Sam.It is always good to have you on the show.So as Julie was pointing out, maybe we're taking a, a bit of a pause here, Sam, of course, we've got a, a strong run.What do you make of this market, Sam, just where we are and where you think we're headed?Hey, Josh, good to talk to you again.Um, yeah, I think at least in the near term we're probably headed a little bit higher.Uh, but I am getting increasingly concerned that we, uh have to endure another decline of 5% or more before the year is out.Uh I point to history for making that statement.This was the, uh, the 11th best first quarter return since World war two.Uh And of the top 1514 of them had declines of 5% or more.And then if that decline was actually less than 10% we had a repeat.Uh And the average decline was about 12.5%.The good news, the silver lining is that each one of these 15 years posted full year gains with the average being above 20%.So that seems to bode well, Sam, but in the meantime, when you talk about the possibility of that pullback, what are your main contenders for?What could trigger it?Well, I, I guess the, the real problem is that, uh, the market tends to get tripped up by unanticipated events and unanticipated events are hard to anticipate.But I would tend to say that if we end up just moving too quickly.Right now, the S and P 500 is trading one standard deviation above the average difference between its 200 day moving average and the index itself.So I just feel that if we get too far above, we're time to have some sort of resetting of the dials digestion.If we start to see other economic indicators, that point to an economic slowdown that causes investors to worry that maybe we are headed for a recession rather than and simply a soft landing.Let's face it.Today's consumer confidence was something that was not anticipated.Uh But at the same time, I still feel that these kind of resetting of the dial are healthy for the market also, Sam, you know, so you, you're talking some technicals there are also interested though Sam just to get your take on valuation here for the market at these levels.How's it looking?Uh looking pretty pricey?The S and P 500 is trading at a 30% premium to its 20 year average pe uh we're also looking at tech that's trading at about a uh multiple of 30 which is looking sort of like a very firm ceiling uh for that group.Uh Also trading at a hefty premium to its uh longer term relative pe those groups that are actually attractively valued from a relative pe discount perspective, not surprisingly mid caps, small caps energy stocks uh as well as utilities.Um and let's talk about the other side of that coin, right?And big uh big cap tech as I talked about earlier, they continue to be dominating returns here.Uh, when you look at the major averages, accounting for a lot of the gains we've been seeing.Where do we go from here on that front?I mean, these guys are still setting records.Oh, they sure are.Uh, technology was the best performing group on a year to date basis.Also, just in the past week, technology was up almost 6% while the S and P was up less than uh 2%.Uh And technology was the only outperforming sector.So I guess another worry could be uh how long can this Jumbo Jet fly on only one engine?Uh But my, my feeling is that um historically in election years, when you do have the uh top three performing sectors midway through that year, they tend on average to be out performers for the second half as well.And Sam just one other sector I wanna kind of dig deeper with you on is utilities.Uh because we said we've had some, some smart tragedies come on the show and really pound the table on that one saying, you know, it's a smart way for investors to kind of play offense and defense at the same time, but you're actually underweight that sector.How come Sam?Well, because what we look at is not just the momentum of the group but also uh the percentage of stocks in the category that have buy and strong buy recommendations.Uh And our analysts basically are pointing to the fact that only three of the uh 31 companies in the S and P 500 utilities sector index are really A I related and are posting above average returns, take out those stocks and the sector would be underperform.Uh So I think you do have to be fairly selective.Yes, there will be increased power needs for uh the data centers, et cetera.Um But I think you have to be very selective as to what stocks to go for.Sam, one of the things that we've noticed as of late um among some of the law cap tech, but just more broadly, our our new stock splits being announced and I don't think the numbers necessarily absolute on an absolute basis are going up, but we've got a lot of high profile companies, you know, we had uh NVIDIA, we had Broadcom announcing them.Does that say anything about the sort of general vibe of the market at all?I think it does.I think it indicates that uh company management is feeling more optimistic about the future.And so they are willing in a sense to make their share prices more accessible uh to a greater number of investors, institutional investors focus more on the dollar value.Uh But retail investors uh look to the price of the underlying stock.Uh Remember, you know, I go back a long way uh and it used to be that a stock wanted to have uh split if it got between 40 $80 a share to make it more appealing and affordable for investors.Because back in the sixties, seventies, et cetera, uh uh prior to commission free trading, it was a lot less expensive to buy a round lot or multiple of 100 than it was an odd lot.Uh Also now today, however, with commission free trading with uh the shares, uh basically, it's not much of a concern but it is more of a psychological tailwind for that company.Sam Shifting gears a bit here.I'm, I'm also interested to get your take on politics and just sort of the kind of political uncertainty we're now seeing really kinda on both side, the Atlantic Sam, you know, of course in Europe, um you saw what happened there, things to be, seem to be on the move, maybe a real shift to the right there.Of course, here we have the election coming up.How is a market strategist, Sam?Are you trying to think through all that?Well, that's a good point.I mean, we do have our Washington analysis arm, uh which monitors all of the uh the bills going through Congress, but also monitors uh the polls to see which candidates are ahead.Uh And right now the uh the thought is that if the election were today, Trump would be the Victor and the US would too also be shifting more toward the right.What it reminds me of our years, like 68 9, like 1980 like 1948 when you actually had third party candidates involved.Uh, and, you know, basically, uh, with Robert Kennedy Junior now in the race, along with Trump Biden where they are split evenly right now.Um, I, in many ways it's anyone's guess historically, it used to be that, uh, the markets return from July 31 through October 31 was a very good indicator.An upward move pointed to a re-election, a downward move pointed to a replacement.Um But with asterisks, usually the third parties can be disruptors.That is really interesting.Sam, we will keep an eye on that return with the asterisk in mind.Good to see you.Thanks so much and have a great weekend.Thanks, you too.Well, let's check in on one of the top trending tickers on the Yahoo Finance home page.Now it's another ticker being fueled by A I.We're talking about Adobe shares have been soaring today.David Wadhwani, the president of the company's digital media business says we're excited about the accelerating pace of innovation across the digital media business and pleased with the adoption of A I functionality that has something that propelled the numbers higher in the quarter and also propelled the forecast and Josh as we discussed yesterday a little bit, it is not something that investors had taken for granted.Yeah, I mean, this is, it was such an interesting earnings point because there had been these real worries about, um, and really two big ones, one of those was the macro and just the choppiness we're seeing in other software names.But the guidance they offered seemed to put that worry to rest, at least for now and then there, obviously there have been these concerns about gen A I comp competition too.But I think people looked at this print and thought, you know what it looks like, at least based on this report, they're finding real traction with, with their A I features here.Yeah.And the stock gain, by the way, that is on a single basis, the biggest gain in four years.So really um the stock jumping here, although it has been down this year, it was up big last year than has fallen this year because of these, some of these concerns around some of the issues that we're talking about.Um and really what the company emphasized in its call and the forecast is that it expects things to accelerate um with that annual revenue in digital media through the course of the year.Yeah, the team at Jeffries led by the Great Brent till telling the clients today there was little to poke at in these results that Adobe appears to be finally reaping the fruits of investing in A I and digital content creation and marketing tools just when content demand is exploding, seems like at least A few people agree with them today.Yeah, it definitely looks that way.All we're just getting started here on market domination.Coming up.Elon Musk has won the shareholder battle to keep his record breaking pay.So what now what's next for Tesla and its CEO will discuss on the other side?Plus it's the latest edition of our series.Goodbye or goodbye will take a deeper dive into two stocks to help you make the best moves for your portfolio state t more market domination.On the other side, the votes are in and Tesla shareholders approving Ceo Elon Musk's controversial $56 billion pay package Musk taking the stage after the results and offering some characteristically optimistic goals for the EV maker.It's within, within the realm of possibility uh for Tesla to achieve evaluation 10 times that of the most valuable company today.And if you just plot the points on the curve of how well autonomy is progressing and just believe the curve um it's headed towards uh unsupervised, full self driving very quickly at an exponential pace.It, it actually gets way crazier.Uh w when you think about the, the optimist uh robot, which is really a humanoid robot that is intended to um you know, be able to do anything you wanted to do.Joining us now is Kevin Paffrath Financial Analyst and youtuber, meet Kevin Kevin.Um Let me take it off here, right?We're, we're gonna have self driving cars Robo Taxis where we let Tesla like navigate our cars around.We're gonna have a, a robot that does everything for us, I guess.And the value of Tesla is gonna be some, you know, whatever trillions of dollars here.What do you think?Well, I think there's a lot of hope built into that but uh let's say, look, the shareholder vote now behind us is great news.It's a big negative catalyst away for Tesla.But you're right, Elon has grand visions that you won't have to drive anymore, which frankly cars driving themselves in the long term, probably going to be a lot safer for the entire world.They already are today on FSD financially safer.So I think it's a great thing and we've seen a lot of progress in full self driving.I question the exponential progress.Uh that Elon is talking about this idea that oh FSD is growing exponentially.It's it's growing.But what we know with artificial intelligence, which Jensen Huang uh showed us in one of their artificial intelligence presentations was that the costs for artificial intelligence go up exponentially but progress actually more s curves and then Peters out so you get less progress with more costs.And so going forward.Yeah, Elon's right.We are going towards an autonomous future and it's so great to see shareholders reaffirm their trust in Elon.I just don't think it's going to happen as fast as he's suggesting.And I don't think it necessarily is going to be as large in the long term.But that's ok. We can be bullish on the stock in the next 2 to 4 years.As Tes Tesla still has probably the best moat in full self driving that exists.It's not as big as it used to be.I'd put it at about 18 to 24 months ahead of some of the competitors, what we're seeing out of Byd in China Xing Motors.But we're definitely still ahead and Kevin, you did mention that pay package and it didn't get approved.And so I'm just curious, Kevin, is that what you expected?And, and as a, as a shareholder, is that what you supported Kevin?Yeah, it is.So I did this little tax loss harvesting event for my fund PP the pricing power ETF where uh we sold uh in mid March and then bought back in at roughly the same price in mid April, but we missed the vote deadline by one day.Uh That said I did make public that I was in favor of the vote passing and that I would vote for it if I could.Now with this book, I can ask you, Kevin, how come it was?Let me just get your take.Why Kevin, why did you support it?Oh, absolutely.Well, so first of all, the deal was made in 2018 and it was very public.This was like a YOLO cull option for Elon to go for this frankly, if that same deal was made today at those prices, then everybody would look at that as a shareholder and go well, at least 70% like we had.Then of course, we're going to support, if you can move the market capitalization of this stock essentially exponentially, of course, we're going to support paying for you.So receiving that and then being frustrated about Elon in the short term, I don't think is fair.I think it, it hits on an element of justice, but we could really go into sort of AAA different world there.I don't think justice was served by what the Delaware Judge conducted.Uh that said long term, we've got to look at Tesla as this is how I value it.I don't look at it as a 30 to $50 trillion humanoid optimist, you know, program look, that's great.That's wonderful.Sort of icing on the cake as a financial advisor and running A I, I can't price that in.So what I do is I look at data, I look at quarter to data bottoming early sales data indicates that Q two is not going to be as bad as feared.I think it's because of the financing.They finally realized that offering people a lower monthly payment just 0.99% APR in May.Now they're at 1.99.Uh in June is a sign that people are payment sensitive, not necessarily price sensitive.And I think that's actually going to help skyrocket Tesla shares and form a bottom here in delivery numbers.We already know that margins have bottomed.They're the only auto company to have over 18% gross margins excluding the cyber truck on vehicles, especially electric vehicles, most companies lose money on these.So really what Elon's doing here is he's creating a bottoming process in the actual manufacturing of electric vehicles.At the same time, he's rehired back the charging team, which is great, most of them at least.And all of the other electric vehicle companies that I'm studying, Ford GM, they're all scared, they're reducing their exposure to electric vehicles.Elon is creating a massive United States electric vehicle mode for Tesla and Tesla shareholders that said 11 last thing quickly.If, if China were able to sell evs here, I would not own Tesla.So you are relying on the government to protect you a bit.Well, and, and when you're looking at how the company is valued though, I mean, just to compare it to Toyota just to give one example here, uh you look at the market cap of Tesla versus a Toyota.Um You know, there is a big gap here, Tesla, uh a bigger market cap.It's the gap has been bigger in the past.Uh The revenue Toyota though is not quite three times but close to three times the margins to your point at Tesla on an automotive basis are higher.But, you know, if you're just looking, we, we always call it an EV maker, but if you're just valuing it and even if you're just valuing it as an EV maker, it doesn't seem to account for how the market is valuing it.It has to deliver on all this stuff and it, it doesn't seem to, I mean, can it be in 2026 or 27 or 29 or whenever the stuff that he's promising is actually gonna happen?Well, I, I like to look at sort of what do I think Tesla is going to deliver versus what Elon promises because I think there's a large split between those.Don't get me wrong.I appreciate the optimism of the CEO I would expect that.And you're right, Toyota would have been a much better stock frankly to own for the last three years than Tesla.Tesla has just been on a straight downtrend.And it's very unfortunate the difference between the two companies is growth.I value Tesla had a peg ratio of 1.67 assuming we can get about 30% growth.Once we bottom out from here, Toyota is growing in some years, it's projected to grow negatively but more reasonably, it's growing somewhere between 5 to 6% which is barely above the rate of inflation.So that's one of the reasons you see the valuation disparity, but it's also one of the reasons you've seen a lot more downside with Tesla because we did have to go through a few negative growth periods.24 is going to be the big one.Now that said, here's how I think someone could hedge themselves, obviously not personalized advice, but I think you can go short and people get mad at me for saying this, but it's just a hedge, it's a macro hedge.You go short, Bitcoin, you could use a fund like bit I I'm not affiliated with them as a negative one.The reason for that is when risk assets sell off Tesla goes down.Look at what's happening today, the French sovereign debt crisis, you've got risk assets selling off when risk that sell off.Bitcoin goes down as well.But look at NVIDIA, it's up.So you don't want to short the whole market for a hedge because that's not going to work.You specifically want an offsetting risk hedge and I think Bitcoin is the perfect way to hedge your Tesla position.Interesting.That's not what I've heard before.Sorry, Kevin.Kevin, thank you so much for joining us.We always appreciate your time.Have a good weekend.Thank you.You as well.Let's check in on some more trending tickers starting with micro strategy shares, jumping company announcing it's raising $500 million in a bond sale in an effort to buy more Bitcoin.So this one Julie, um let's keep it simple.Basically, they, they boost their convertible note offering by about 40%.And company says they're gonna use the proceeds to, you guessed it buy more Bitcoin.Of course, Michael Saylor, co founder and chairman here started buying Bitcoin in 2020 has become certainly one of the better known Bitcoin Bulls out there and it is up about 600% since Mr Saylor first started piling in here.Yeah.And you know, micro strategy now owns about 1% of all of the Bitcoin that's ever been created, which is amazing.At the same time, we've got Gautam Chaan over Bernstein initiating coverage of micro strategy.Um and he's positive on the stock but not just positive on the stock.His price target is $2890 which would be about 80% higher than it is right now.And it's so interesting micro strategy is quite controversial to be clear, right?There are folks who have shorted the stock.There are people who have criticized the premium at which it trades to Bitcoin.If you look at how micro strategy has done this this year versus how Bitcoin has done this year, it's up a lot more and it holds a heck of a lot of Bitcoin on its balance sheet because as you see there, almost all of the cash it has is in Bitcoin compared with other companies that you think of as being pro Bitcoin like a Tesla or a block, all of this is something that choi likes and thinks that their leverage strategy is a good way for people to kind of get in on Bitcoin.And by the way, you mentioned the team at Bernstein initial coverage here, they gave you some Bitcoin targets as well.You see that in the note, they revise up our Bitcoin price expectation and now up to 200,000, they say cycle high by 2025 led, they told their clients by unprecedented Bitcoin demand via those shiny new ETF S and Bitcoin supply being constructed.What's interesting to me is one of C's um the reasons he's bullish on micro strategy is he says investors are willing to pay a premium in view of scarcity of Bitcoin corporate investment vehicles.Now there is that scarcity of corporate investment vehicles, but to your point, there is now no shortage of ETF investment vehicles.So the whole argument for a premium because of micro strategy being this rare leverage way to play Bitcoin or rare even way to get access to Bitcoin without buying it directly.That has gone away a little bit, a little bit of a hit.Yeah, so we'll see if that keeps up that premium continues to widen.Let's also talk about Rh it's in focus today after the furniture retailer reported a wider than expected first quarter loss here.Uh The shares down the most in a single day, going back to March of 2020 basically the company has been on a big expansion, right?It's expanded into Europe, although it at first expanded into some secondary markets in Europe, sort of as a test case.It's building itself up as the broader luxury brand like a Ralph Lauren, for example, it's open restaurants, it has these fancy new show rooms, um and it seems like it's costing it a lot of money and that then feeding through to the results.And by the way, Co Gary Friedman on the call, you hear him mincing, no words on the fed uh saying I think they're gonna be, this was on a call with analysts, of course, I think they'll be behind the curve.He says it relates to inflation.So I think it could be behind the curve as it relates to timing of when to to cut those rates.So in our view, our view is probably a little bit more negative than it was a quarter ago.I think a quarter ago he told the street we were feeling a little bit more optimistic that there would be rate cuts in the housing market.We begin to mink, we move in a sustained manner.Well, that would be in his interest, wouldn't you would cut sooner and get not sounding happy.Although he is also so really trying to cater more to ultra luxury at this point.And you could argue that those folks are not as sensitive to changes in interest rates.So does that also say something about that strategy?Leather Couch.You're saying it's not as, not as sensitive.I, you know, if you're buying, what is it?$5000 couches and up.Yeah, there was a $14,000 couch.I saw cited in one article.I bet it looked nice.I bet.So.Sure it did.All right.Moving on, Tempest A I making its Wall Street debut.Trading started today on the NASDAQ.The company pricing its offering at $37 per share.So this one was um an instrument so it makes, it makes its debut.Um They're kind of, they're using A I to process medical data.Um They've actually been around for some time, Julie, they were actually found in 2015, described their businesses creating intelligent diagnostics for precision medicine in terms of the financials posted revenue of 532 million in 2023.That was up from 321 million the year earlier.It looks like they're still losing money that lost about roughly 200 million and 23.Of course, not unusual for a tech company to go public uh posting losses and investors will often look through that, especially if you have A I in the name.Yeah, although it's become less typical, I feel like you have more companies more at a more mature level coming public and maybe posting profit.But this not at that case, it is, it it sounds interesting what they do.They connect your lab results to your personal clinical data to kind of analyze, I guess using A I.So, you know, we'll see uh how they continue to go.They did rise as much as 18% at one point during the day.But as we could see they're up about 10.5%.CEO Eric Lefkofsky also, by the way, co founder Groupon, fact, interesting, very different business.I don't know what lessons he's applying, but he must be applying.Hopefully he'll come talk to us and we can ask him.So that's a formal invitation to Eric.There you go.All right.Still to come.It's the latest edition of our series.Goodbye.Goodbye and take a deeper dive into two stocks to help you make the best moves to your portfolio.Stay tuned, more market domination on your friend.It's a big noisy universe of stocks out there.Welcome to, goodbye or good bye.Our goal to help cut through that noise to navigate the best moves for your portfolio today.We're taking a look at business strategies of two companies in the tech realm.I'm here with Red Needle Ventures founder and very good to see you.Thanks for being here.So let's get to your by stock.First of all, here, we are looking at Palo Alto Networks and this company it's up over the last year, although it's a little bit of volatility as we can see from this chart.Cyber security has been a really interesting space and we've seen some sort of volatility within it as well.Let's talk about platform.I, I even have trouble saying this word platform which I started seeing a lot more in the discussions of companies like Palo Alto and Crowds Street.What, what does this mean?It's a lot of syllables to say, small businesses, enterprises want to buy their cyber security solutions from one place from one company right now, historically, you know, businesses have had to go out and put a hodgepodge of different pieces of the elements of cyber security together.And they're saying, you know what it's really inefficient, it creates vulnerability.We want to go to one place and Palo Alto has really been leaning into being a solutions provider hitting on a lot of those different vertical solutions.Well, that explained it better than any of the companies that I heard themselves discussing it.And Palo Alto has also been winning big contracts from big companies, big ones.We united health Care is a big one that got announced a big strategic relationship announced also recently Julie with IBM and what Palo Alto is going to be doing is providing a lot of the cloud and cybersecurity solutions that IBM is going to its consulting clients and saying, look, this is the go to place to come to.So that was a big one from a go to market perspective.And then finally, also, there's the free cash flow that we are seeing at the company that it could potentially be growing.Yes, I love this.You and I talked about this a lot.I'm a free cash flow girl, 37% free margin for Palo Alto Networks.That's right now, that's before they continue to see some of the efficiencies.They're very focused on cost a lot of the young businesses, the start ups, the growing companies I speak to if they could pick their acquire, they'd like to be bought by Palo Alto Networks and these guys have got the cash and it's growing.So you think if they're going out there to make acquisitions, it's going to be of technology, it's going to be of start ups rather than other like rather than a big sort of acquisition.I think.So, I think that actually if you look at value creation over time, finding homes, finding tons where you can really get synergies without the risk that comes from doing a big merger of equals or consuming a massive acquisition with a potential class of clash of cultures.I think Palo Alto is going to be able to get some chunky, some sizable acquisitions but nothing that's too big to swallow.And that way you add to the functionality of that big platform as well, filling in those gaps.We like to talk about the risks potentially here and you know, they're spending money, they're being aggressive.One of the downsides of that.Well, this one way is one where you have to believe in execution.You've got to believe you've got leadership setting clear goals, holding their teams accountable and making sure that they're super focused on how they're actually doing what they say they're going to do.It sounds simple.It's very hard to do.In practice.In this case, Palo Alto has been going after a really bold I think strategy to get market share.They've been going to some big potential clients and saying if you are using an existing alternative provider, we will on board you and take you on for a couple of months for free so that you're not doubled, you know, you're not double spending as long as that is an incentive for you to move over.That's pretty bold.It means a couple of losses on some of those accounts as they win them, but it's working at the moment.It has to continue for the share price to keep heading up into the right.And before we head to your goodbye, the do you hold Palo Alto?I do hold Palo Alto and I've been adding that share price you had at the beginning when you've seen those dips.I've been going back.Oh, interesting.All right.Let's get to the stock you're avoiding and that is paypal and you're not on avoiding this one.The stock is down over the past year.But let's get to why you're avoiding it here.While Palo Alto has that strategy, you don't think paypal has it.Here's the thread.Both of them are execution plays.I'll come back to that.But this is also about paypal.When you take a big step back, this is a business that touches 25% of global e commerce.I look at that and say this thing should be winning, it should be winning on data aggregation.It should be winning in A I applications.It should be winning and gaining share and cross selling.This new CEO has now been in the seat about nine months.I've been waiting to hear.Here's the big bold vision that we've got a la pala ala networks.Crickets haven't heard it yet.Yeah, I mean, part of that, I guess is a go to market strategy now.We, we've been talking a lot about go to market strategies with these.Yeah, enterprise players.Basically what it means is sales strategy.How do we, how do we get our product out there to more people and sell more stuff?That's exactly right.And so what paypal has been doing is moving the deck chairs a little bit.They've said that we're going to go after market verticals, we're going to stop selling on a product by product basis and selling on a solutions basis to the different user bases.But again, if it's not going behind a big strategy that what you're doing feels a little bit like tweaking around the edges and I haven't seen really groundbreaking results coming out of these tactics so far.Well, and to your point, paypal is enormous.I mean, I can't, I can't tell you how many times I click on that check out using.But, you know, if they, if they don't do these other things, maybe that market share dominance will not last.Well, I think that's right, Julie and also this is one where I've looked at the rise and rise of stripe, for example, I've looked at the rise and rise of the B NPL players like a firm after Pay cloner.And I look at that and I sort of want to tear my hair up because I'm like, where's paypal?Right?They had the first mover advantage to be able to take what are products.What I've just said a firm after pay, those were products.They didn't have to become enterprises, had paypal got its act together and gone after it and it didn't.So I'm concerned about market share and then on the flip side, what could work for paypal, I guess to put it simply is if start doing all this stuff that you're talking about.Well, exactly.So Alex Chris again, I have deep respect for him.He got into the seat four months ago.He went on TV and he said we're going to shock the world, right?We've got this great stat, start with this huge amount of penetration.We're going to shock the world.Well, you know, I'm ready to be shocked.Let's see it.Yeah, it's still, he came, he then came out with an, I don't even remember what the announcement was.That's innovation.I don't really remember.Exactly.That's the point.There's a shrug.There's a bit of a shrug when it comes to some of the paypal innovation and I'm ready to be shocked even if it's got risk.Right.I like the fact that Palo Alto Network says risk to the strategy, but at least it's got one.Yeah, they're taking, they're taking that risk any position in paypal one way I sold out.So I think my money's been doing what I'm saying.Ok. And good to see you.Thanks for coming in and thank you so much for watching.Goodbye or goodbye.We'll be bringing you new episodes next week at 3:30 p.m. Eastern.All right, let's get to our call of the day.Check out Sheriff of Shopify.They are on the rise is coming after a new note from evercore.I si upgrading the name to outperform from in line and this is ever core's Mark Mahaney, of course, well known, well respected analys to folks pay attention to Mahaney does upgrade this one to outperform price target.75 says there's been this pull back on this one and, and the stock is down about 12% this year and that offers Mahany telling his clients an attractive entry points, his valuation and estimates he thinks now sufficiently de risk.Yeah.And he's looking at the long term here when he's looking at the stock, he says there is a very resilient long thesis and he talks about a couple of things that support it.He talks about the very large total addressable market, strong competitive position, up market activity and clear track record of successful product innovation.So he's got a lot of reasons he likes it.He was just sort of, it sounds like for this entry point with the stock.I mean, it's come back a little bit lately as you can see from that chart, but also still is kind of weak year to date.Yeah, maybe not, not on an island.I mean, most of the financial analysts come this name do think it's A B Yes, we'll see if it goes to that $75 price target.Here we go.Still to come, get out the sunscreen and pack those bags.We're taking all, we're talking all things travel from cruises to airlines next on market domination.Shares of cruise lines hitting choppy water in today's trade Viking holdings.Royal Caribbean carnival cruise lines in Norwegian.They all came under pressure after B of A analysts called out what they said was modest softening in ocean cruise prices during the month of June.So it was interesting here, Julia, I mean, the the companies obviously had been reporting earlier results.And I thought, you know, the kind of message of the takeaway was it was broadly positive.I mean, there's still lots of talk about record bookings, for example, but here comes B of A and their team gets to work, pull out their pencils and then conclude that in June, there was indeed they say modestly softer pricing um in ocean markets relative to early May.The analysts saying 40% of cruise itineraries had softer pricing compared with 33% in May.Um And you saw the stocks reacting to that.I mean, on the flip side, if you dig into, I mean, it feels like yes, there was a sell off on this but also maybe there were other reasons buying the sell off.I mean, if you dig into this and you can see from that chart it's really volatile according to their survey, at least if you look at the pricing that was negative um in the past month, that 40% figure you get 33% the month before that 21% 60% 24.You know, it's, it's, it bounces around a lot and it seems like that the cruise lines are very reactive when it comes to pricing, dynamic pricing.That's something we've heard from them before that they do.So it's hard to know how seriously to take this.I mean, one interesting minor note from this is that they also did a survey of Viking pricing for the first time.Viking, the European river boat uh operator that just came public and they said there's less volatility in that market.I mean, there aren't, there isn't as much competition, I don't think in the river cruise market.So maybe that's part of the reason why, but it had flat pricing essentially also as to that chart pointed out.I mean, some of these names have had some World Caribbean more than 50% in the past 12 months.Well, sticking with travel, Josh Airlines have a potential problem, travel demand is projected to hit a record high this summer based on earnings forecast.But the issue, ongoing problems at Boeing are hindering airlines access to new planes and limiting potential for growth.Potentially we're looking at how to navigate the big picture with the Yahoo finance playbook joining us now, Peter third bridge, global sector lead for industrial materials and energy alongside George Ferguson Bloomberg Intelligence, senior analyst covering the aerospace defense and airline industries.Guys, it is great to see you.Thanks for being here.I think you guys have a little bit different views from each other on the capacity constraints that are out there.Peter, I want to start with you and and how you see it for the industry there.What's the demand supply match up looking like right now?Well, demands been healthy.It's been growing for four years now.Um The problem is, you know, airlines do want these new planes, they can't get them, they're keeping the ones that they do have in the air longer for sure.But there's still some maintenance constraints too that need to go on, particularly around, around engines.So it is, you know, capacity is growing.It's just not growing as fast as the airlines hope.And you've got, you know, companies like United who've got very ambitious targets out to 2026 that they've had to temper that a bit.So, you know, we'll see, it doesn't seem like Boeing's uh problems are gonna be sorted anytime soon and it's not like Airbus can go any faster than, than they already are.A and George Le le let's um get you in as well.Maybe we'll start there with that same big picture question.George demand supply dynamics.How are you thinking about it?Yeah, so we put a report out this week on, on this question because it's been overhanging the market here for, I think, you know, for months now.Uh there's definitely a lot of concern that there's not enough lift.We basically analyze profitability for all the major airlines globally.And we looked at their ebita margins which would be margins before, you know, you pay for any changes in your capital structure because debt, maybe you took on during the pandemic or whatever.So we looked at ebita margins compared to last year compared to 2019 and 2016, 2 of the best years in the last decade and most airlines aren't achieving those margins.So, I'd say there's record travel and that's because the airlines are putting, putting record schedules up into the air.But probably, thank God they can't get all those airplanes because they cross margins even more.When will they slow down?I think when they start having uh losses and they, they're not there yet.But we, when we look at profitability and return on invested capital measures, they are just not performing like they did last decade, there's too much capacity.That's so interesting.And I mean, the airlines have always sort of struggled with this capacity, how to get that balance.Right.Peter, are there any airlines that are, are navigating this better than some of the others?Either because of the circumstances, they're not as exposed to say Boeing or because execution wise they're doing a better job.Well, I think the, the one of the big problems that are not talking about that make airlines less profitable than they were pre panic is labor costs.You know, you've negotiated with the union, you step up 30 to 40% which has been the rate what you've seen and then you stay there, you know, so this has been a dragon, whether it's pilots, mechanics, uh flight attendants, they're all getting, getting more money.But uh you know, Delta Airlines has been the one that has found a way to navigate this uh better, better than others.Um, extremely loyal business, uh travelers, a very good fleet, clean balance sheet.Um, no real need for like major investments.The way, let's say American had to do a, a big refresh on their fleet prepa uh borrowed a lot of money to do things like that or United as we talked about a bit earlier with this aggressive uh growth strategy that they have.But I think kind of the unhidden or the, you know, the unappreciated asset that Delta has is their tech ops business that allows them to do their own maintenance, repair and overhaul, which, you know, we started seeing engine problems last summer um that has grounded a lot of Airbus planes, you know, they had uh jetblue and, and a few others a bit more, but uh Delta seems to be the one that has navigated best.You, you, you agree with that George, would you, would you say um Delta, if you were to look across, you know, the industry seems to be navigating this mo most effectively?Definitely, I, I we totally agree there.So I think if you look at the US market, it's Delta and United that are performing better than all the, the other airlines, I think that's a function of premium, both premium leisure travel and business travel demand.Uh and long haul, I think long haul is generally performing better than short haul now.Right.So if you're going inside a continent.I think things are very competitive because there's a lot of low cost carriers that will compete uh you know, with you, even if you're a full service carrier uh to carry those passengers.So, fares are under pressure.But I, I think still this summer you'll see good fares into Europe, pretty good fares uh into Asia Pacific.And that helps Delta and United the most in the US.George.Do you think that the whole labor issue here and both the difficulty of flying, finding staff and also the higher wages to pay them?Do you think that that is a problem?That's just here to stay.So I do.And so we've written a report on this as well.It's under the Bloomberg uh service.Uh, so when we looked at, uh, retirements that were coming, um, we use Airline Pilot, central.com, which I think is fairly reputable.But I, I will admit, you know, we, we could sort of dive in and get the, the numbers exactly ourselves.But when we looked at their numbers on retirements, we think retirements are going to peak 2026 2027.I think it, I think it's sort of similar to the dynamics in the rest of the economy where a lot of people, boomers came in a lot of these businesses and they're retiring now in, in larger numbers, pilots are really hard to replace because they're highly trained, takes years and years to get trained up to get into a cockpit.Uh, and they're the ones getting sort of the 20% increases at the last, uh, pay negotiation.I suspect they may get that similar number actually, maybe not as high as 20 but they may get pretty high numbers mid decade when they, uh, when they do this again.So, yeah, that, that's a big problem right now with airlines.11 other question I have Peter.Um and I realize this sounds like a smaller question, but just from a consumer point of view, I'm interested to get your take.You see this trend of airlines raising bag fees, is that, is that a smart way to raise more revenue or do you risk alienating your customer?How do you think about it?Well, you know, look once, once, you know, one airline does it and it follows another and then, and then another, it's just gonna be the way it is like we eliminated change fees, you know, during the pandemic at some point that's going to come back to it is a, it is a valuable source of revenue um that the airlines, you know, will, you know, will pull on at some point.You know, it's part of the prescription.I see that Elliott as you know, the activist for Southwest is to, you know, introduce more bag fees.But uh these companies are, you know, are trying to grow profits and that's one more way to do it, I mean, George, it's not just the bag fees.Right.I mean, at this point I feel like I'm paying up to not sit on a cardboard box on the plane.You know, it, it's got, like there, it's, everything is, is in these tiers and I sort of agree with Josh here.At what point do you risk alienation?Although I guess your choice is just not to fly at all.Yeah, I think that's about right.I think everywhere you go now the revenue managers are looking for different ways to slice and dice the airplane cabin and figure out what they can get people to pay for.Right.And so the challenge is to find more things to sell and in the old days those are things you and I just got, I guess got for free, got by luck when we got, you know, an, an exit aisle or something like that.Uh And so that's the new formula for increasing revenue.Delta.Does it?I think better than uh most others?I think it may be here to stay and hard to avoid.Peter George gonna leave it there.Thanks guys for joining the show today.Appreciate it.Thank you.While we are wrapping up today's market domination.Don't go anywhere.We've got you covered with all the action following the closing bell.Stay tuned for market domination.Overtime.",

tempus ai  tem  shares also popped after making its trading debut on the nasdaq via an ipo this post was written by melanie riehlvideo transcripthello and welcome to market domination i m julie high and that s josh lift in live from our new york city headquarters we are giving you the ultimate investing play book to help tune out the noise and make the right moves for your money and here s your headline blitz getting you up to speed one hour before the closing bell rings on wall story continueswhen you look at the tester story  autonomous fsd  i can argue it s one of the best a i plays in the market when you look at next 234 years  this is just the start of the next chapter of the next book is  it must call it in the t of grosser i think it is one of the best disruptive names in the world it doesn t appear that the technology in this a i story is approaching uh uh uh a level where it s going to solve it looks like it s still morphing into other things the only thing sustaining current economic growth is a wealth effect from the bull market and consumer spending the asymmetries of risk are that the economy can do much worse than consensus far more easily than it can do much better than consensus one hour to go until the market close so let s take a look at the major averages right now we are losing a little bit of steam today after the rally that we ve been seeing in recent days right now  the dow off by nearly 100 points  it off by about a quarter of 1  the s and p 500 after four consecutive record closes is not on track to repeat that feat today down about 1 10 of 1  or so  nasdaq though  maybe we ve got right now it s very little change so we ll see where it trends in the last hour of trading and by the way  the nasdaq return over the past five days looking like here better than 3  looking over at some of the components of the nasdaq you know  it s been so interesting we keep talking about this broadening of the market uh we talked to our josh schafer yesterday that a lot of wall street stra just are calling for that broadening in the second half of the year but we have seen really some of the large cap tech continue to lead some of the gains that we have been watching here s the weekly look  here  you look at an nvidia of 9 2  apple of nearly 8  microsoft gaining and you see what s been going on there another name i wanted to call out here is netflix up about two and three quarters percent today and trading at a  uh  looks like maybe on track for a record close in today s session we re gonna keep an eye on that to see if it makes it there the year to date return for netflix some 38  we also continue to watch the sort of market cap race if you will here  uh  for many of these companies  um not seeing the market cap here come up on this one  see if it will  if we switch it around a little bit no  it s not coming up but anyway  you see what these guys have been doing on a daily basis here there s the market cap so we ve got a microsoft back in the top position  apple now in number two  nvidia and number three  but we continue to have that sort of neck and neck race uh for market cap between those tech giants  josh all right  julie stocks are fighting for gains today as consumer sentiment tumbling in june this comes as the s and p 500 nasdaq have each nailed record closes this week for more on the latest market moves let s welcome in sam stonewall cfr  a research chief investment strategist  sam it is always good to have you on the show so as julie was pointing out  maybe we re taking a  a bit of a pause here  sam  of course  we ve got a  a strong run what do you make of this market  sam  just where we are and where you think we re headed hey  josh  good to talk to you again um  yeah  i think at least in the near term we re probably headed a little bit higher uh  but i am getting increasingly concerned that we  uh have to endure another decline of 5  or more before the year is out uh i point to history for making that statement this was the  uh  the 11th best first quarter return since world war two uh and of the top 1514 of them had declines of 5  or more and then if that decline was actually less than 10  we had a repeat uh and the average decline was about 12 5  the good news  the silver lining is that each one of these 15 years posted full year gains with the average being above 20  so that seems to bode well  sam  but in the meantime  when you talk about the possibility of that pullback  what are your main contenders for what could trigger it well  i  i guess the  the real problem is that  uh  the market tends to get tripped up by unanticipated events and unanticipated events are hard to anticipate but i would tend to say that if we end up just moving too quickly right now  the s and p 500 is trading one standard deviation above the average difference between its 200 day moving average and the index itself so i just feel that if we get too far above  we re time to have some sort of resetting of the dials digestion if we start to see other economic indicators  that point to an economic slowdown that causes investors to worry that maybe we are headed for a recession rather than and simply a soft landing let s face it today s consumer confidence was something that was not anticipated uh but at the same time  i still feel that these kind of resetting of the dial are healthy for the market also  sam  you know  so you  you re talking some technicals there are also interested though sam just to get your take on valuation here for the market at these levels how s it looking uh looking pretty pricey the s and p 500 is trading at a 30  premium to its 20 year average pe uh we re also looking at tech that s trading at about a uh multiple of 30 which is looking sort of like a very firm ceiling uh for that group uh also trading at a hefty premium to its uh longer term relative pe those groups that are actually attractively valued from a relative pe discount perspective  not surprisingly mid caps  small caps energy stocks uh as well as utilities um and let s talk about the other side of that coin  right and big uh big cap tech as i talked about earlier  they continue to be dominating returns here uh  when you look at the major averages  accounting for a lot of the gains we ve been seeing where do we go from here on that front i mean  these guys are still setting records oh  they sure are uh  technology was the best performing group on a year to date basis also  just in the past week  technology was up almost 6  while the s and p was up less than uh 2  uh and technology was the only outperforming sector so i guess another worry could be uh how long can this jumbo jet fly on only one engine uh but my  my feeling is that um historically in election years  when you do have the uh top three performing sectors midway through that year  they tend on average to be out performers for the second half as well and sam just one other sector i wanna kind of dig deeper with you on is utilities uh because we said we ve had some  some smart tragedies come on the show and really pound the table on that one saying  you know  it s a smart way for investors to kind of play offense and defense at the same time  but you re actually underweight that sector how come sam well  because what we look at is not just the momentum of the group but also uh the percentage of stocks in the category that have buy and strong buy recommendations uh and our analysts basically are pointing to the fact that only three of the uh 31 companies in the s and p 500 utilities sector index are really a i related and are posting above average returns  take out those stocks and the sector would be underperform uh so i think you do have to be fairly selective yes  there will be increased power needs for uh the data centers  et cetera um but i think you have to be very selective as to what stocks to go for sam  one of the things that we ve noticed as of late um among some of the law cap tech  but just more broadly  our our new stock splits being announced and i don t think the numbers necessarily absolute on an absolute basis are going up  but we ve got a lot of high profile companies  you know  we had uh nvidia  we had broadcom announcing them does that say anything about the sort of general vibe of the market at all i think it does i think it indicates that uh company management is feeling more optimistic about the future and so they are willing in a sense to make their share prices more accessible uh to a greater number of investors  institutional investors focus more on the dollar value uh but retail investors uh look to the price of the underlying stock uh remember  you know  i go back a long way uh and it used to be that a stock wanted to have uh split if it got between 40  80 a share to make it more appealing and affordable for investors because back in the sixties  seventies  et cetera  uh uh prior to commission free trading  it was a lot less expensive to buy a round lot or multiple of 100 than it was an odd lot uh also now today  however  with commission free trading with uh the shares  uh basically  it s not much of a concern but it is more of a psychological tailwind for that company sam shifting gears a bit here i m  i m also interested to get your take on politics and just sort of the kind of political uncertainty we re now seeing really kinda on both side  the atlantic sam  you know  of course in europe  um you saw what happened there  things to be  seem to be on the move  maybe a real shift to the right there of course  here we have the election coming up how is a market strategist  sam are you trying to think through all that well  that s a good point i mean  we do have our washington analysis arm  uh which monitors all of the uh the bills going through congress  but also monitors uh the polls to see which candidates are ahead uh and right now the uh the thought is that if the election were today  trump would be the victor and the us would too also be shifting more toward the right what it reminds me of our years  like 68 9  like 1980 like 1948 when you actually had third party candidates involved uh  and  you know  basically  uh  with robert kennedy junior now in the race  along with trump biden where they are split evenly right now um  i  in many ways it s anyone s guess historically  it used to be that  uh  the markets return from july 31 through october 31 was a very good indicator an upward move pointed to a re election  a downward move pointed to a replacement um but with asterisks  usually the third parties can be disruptors that is really interesting sam  we will keep an eye on that return with the asterisk in mind good to see you thanks so much and have a great weekend thanks  you too well  let s check in on one of the top trending tickers on the yahoo finance home page now it s another ticker being fueled by a i we re talking about adobe shares have been soaring today david wadhwani  the president of the company s digital media business says we re excited about the accelerating pace of innovation across the digital media business and pleased with the adoption of a i functionality that has something that propelled the numbers higher in the quarter and also propelled the forecast and josh as we discussed yesterday a little bit  it is not something that investors had taken for granted yeah  i mean  this is  it was such an interesting earnings point because there had been these real worries about  um  and really two big ones  one of those was the macro and just the choppiness we re seeing in other software names but the guidance they offered seemed to put that worry to rest  at least for now and then there  obviously there have been these concerns about gen a i comp competition too but i think people looked at this print and thought  you know what it looks like  at least based on this report  they re finding real traction with  with their a i features here yeah and the stock gain  by the way  that is on a single basis  the biggest gain in four years so really um the stock jumping here  although it has been down this year  it was up big last year than has fallen this year because of these  some of these concerns around some of the issues that we re talking about um and really what the company emphasized in its call and the forecast is that it expects things to accelerate um with that annual revenue in digital media through the course of the year yeah  the team at jeffries led by the great brent till telling the clients today there was little to poke at in these results that adobe appears to be finally reaping the fruits of investing in a i and digital content creation and marketing tools just when content demand is exploding  seems like at least a few people agree with them today yeah  it definitely looks that way all we re just getting started here on market domination coming up elon musk has won the shareholder battle to keep his record breaking pay so what now what s next for tesla and its ceo will discuss on the other side plus it s the latest edition of our series goodbye or goodbye will take a deeper dive into two stocks to help you make the best moves for your portfolio state t more market domination on the other side  the votes are in and tesla shareholders approving ceo elon musk s controversial  56 billion pay package musk taking the stage after the results and offering some characteristically optimistic goals for the ev maker it s within  within the realm of possibility uh for tesla to achieve evaluation 10 times that of the most valuable company today and if you just plot the points on the curve of how well autonomy is progressing and just believe the curve um it s headed towards uh unsupervised  full self driving very quickly at an exponential pace it  it actually gets way crazier uh w when you think about the  the optimist uh robot  which is really a humanoid robot that is intended to um you know  be able to do anything you wanted to do joining us now is kevin paffrath financial analyst and youtuber  meet kevin kevin um let me take it off here  right we re  we re gonna have self driving cars robo taxis where we let tesla like navigate our cars around we re gonna have a  a robot that does everything for us  i guess and the value of tesla is gonna be some  you know  whatever trillions of dollars here what do you think well  i think there s a lot of hope built into that but uh let s say  look  the shareholder vote now behind us is great news it s a big negative catalyst away for tesla but you re right  elon has grand visions that you won t have to drive anymore  which frankly cars driving themselves in the long term  probably going to be a lot safer for the entire world they already are today on fsd financially safer so i think it s a great thing and we ve seen a lot of progress in full self driving i question the exponential progress uh that elon is talking about this idea that oh fsd is growing exponentially it s it s growing but what we know with artificial intelligence  which jensen huang uh showed us in one of their artificial intelligence presentations was that the costs for artificial intelligence go up exponentially but progress actually more s curves and then peters out so you get less progress with more costs and so going forward yeah  elon s right we are going towards an autonomous future and it s so great to see shareholders reaffirm their trust in elon i just don t think it s going to happen as fast as he s suggesting and i don t think it necessarily is going to be as large in the long term but that s ok  we can be bullish on the stock in the next 2 to 4 years as tes tesla still has probably the best moat in full self driving that exists it s not as big as it used to be i d put it at about 18 to 24 months ahead of some of the competitors  what we re seeing out of byd in china xing motors but we re definitely still ahead and kevin  you did mention that pay package and it didn t get approved and so i m just curious  kevin  is that what you expected and  and as a  as a shareholder  is that what you supported kevin yeah  it is so i did this little tax loss harvesting event for my fund pp the pricing power etf where uh we sold uh in mid march and then bought back in at roughly the same price in mid april  but we missed the vote deadline by one day uh that said i did make public that i was in favor of the vote passing and that i would vote for it if i could now with this book  i can ask you  kevin  how come it was let me just get your take why kevin  why did you support it oh  absolutely well  so first of all  the deal was made in 2018 and it was very public this was like a yolo cull option for elon to go for this frankly  if that same deal was made today at those prices  then everybody would look at that as a shareholder and go well  at least 70  like we had then of course  we re going to support  if you can move the market capitalization of this stock essentially exponentially  of course  we re going to support paying for you so receiving that and then being frustrated about elon in the short term  i don t think is fair i think it  it hits on an element of justice  but we could really go into sort of aaa different world there i don t think justice was served by what the delaware judge conducted uh that said long term  we ve got to look at tesla as this is how i value it i don t look at it as a 30 to  50 trillion humanoid optimist  you know  program look  that s great that s wonderful sort of icing on the cake as a financial advisor and running a i  i can t price that in so what i do is i look at data  i look at quarter to data bottoming early sales data indicates that q two is not going to be as bad as feared i think it s because of the financing they finally realized that offering people a lower monthly payment just 0 99  apr in may now they re at 1 99 uh in june is a sign that people are payment sensitive  not necessarily price sensitive and i think that s actually going to help skyrocket tesla shares and form a bottom here in delivery numbers we already know that margins have bottomed they re the only auto company to have over 18  gross margins excluding the cyber truck on vehicles  especially electric vehicles  most companies lose money on these so really what elon s doing here is he s creating a bottoming process in the actual manufacturing of electric vehicles at the same time  he s rehired back the charging team  which is great  most of them at least and all of the other electric vehicle companies that i m studying  ford gm  they re all scared  they re reducing their exposure to electric vehicles elon is creating a massive united states electric vehicle mode for tesla and tesla shareholders that said 11 last thing quickly if  if china were able to sell evs here  i would not own tesla so you are relying on the government to protect you a bit well  and  and when you re looking at how the company is valued though  i mean  just to compare it to toyota just to give one example here  uh you look at the market cap of tesla versus a toyota um you know  there is a big gap here  tesla  uh a bigger market cap it s the gap has been bigger in the past uh the revenue toyota though is not quite three times but close to three times the margins to your point at tesla on an automotive basis are higher but  you know  if you re just looking  we  we always call it an ev maker  but if you re just valuing it and even if you re just valuing it as an ev maker  it doesn t seem to account for how the market is valuing it it has to deliver on all this stuff and it  it doesn t seem to  i mean  can it be in 2026 or 27 or 29 or whenever the stuff that he s promising is actually gonna happen well  i  i like to look at sort of what do i think tesla is going to deliver versus what elon promises because i think there s a large split between those don t get me wrong i appreciate the optimism of the ceo i would expect that and you re right  toyota would have been a much better stock frankly to own for the last three years than tesla tesla has just been on a straight downtrend and it s very unfortunate the difference between the two companies is growth i value tesla had a peg ratio of 1 67 assuming we can get about 30  growth once we bottom out from here  toyota is growing in some years  it s projected to grow negatively but more reasonably  it s growing somewhere between 5 to 6  which is barely above the rate of inflation so that s one of the reasons you see the valuation disparity  but it s also one of the reasons you ve seen a lot more downside with tesla because we did have to go through a few negative growth periods 24 is going to be the big one now that said  here s how i think someone could hedge themselves  obviously not personalized advice  but i think you can go short and people get mad at me for saying this  but it s just a hedge  it s a macro hedge you go short  bitcoin  you could use a fund like bit i i m not affiliated with them as a negative one the reason for that is when risk assets sell off tesla goes down look at what s happening today  the french sovereign debt crisis  you ve got risk assets selling off when risk that sell off bitcoin goes down as well but look at nvidia  it s up so you don t want to short the whole market for a hedge because that s not going to work you specifically want an offsetting risk hedge and i think bitcoin is the perfect way to hedge your tesla position interesting that s not what i ve heard before sorry  kevin kevin  thank you so much for joining us we always appreciate your time have a good weekend thank you you as well let s check in on some more trending tickers starting with micro strategy shares  jumping company announcing it s raising  500 million in a bond sale in an effort to buy more bitcoin so this one julie  um let s keep it simple basically  they  they boost their convertible note offering by about 40  and company says they re gonna use the proceeds to  you guessed it buy more bitcoin of course  michael saylor  co founder and chairman here started buying bitcoin in 2020 has become certainly one of the better known bitcoin bulls out there and it is up about 600  since mr saylor first started piling in here yeah and you know  micro strategy now owns about 1  of all of the bitcoin that s ever been created  which is amazing at the same time  we ve got gautam chaan over bernstein initiating coverage of micro strategy um and he s positive on the stock but not just positive on the stock his price target is  2890 which would be about 80  higher than it is right now and it s so interesting micro strategy is quite controversial to be clear  right there are folks who have shorted the stock there are people who have criticized the premium at which it trades to bitcoin if you look at how micro strategy has done this this year versus how bitcoin has done this year  it s up a lot more and it holds a heck of a lot of bitcoin on its balance sheet because as you see there  almost all of the cash it has is in bitcoin compared with other companies that you think of as being pro bitcoin like a tesla or a block  all of this is something that choi likes and thinks that their leverage strategy is a good way for people to kind of get in on bitcoin and by the way  you mentioned the team at bernstein initial coverage here  they gave you some bitcoin targets as well you see that in the note  they revise up our bitcoin price expectation and now up to 200 000  they say cycle high by 2025 led  they told their clients by unprecedented bitcoin demand via those shiny new etf s and bitcoin supply being constructed what s interesting to me is one of c s um the reasons he s bullish on micro strategy is he says investors are willing to pay a premium in view of scarcity of bitcoin corporate investment vehicles now there is that scarcity of corporate investment vehicles  but to your point  there is now no shortage of etf investment vehicles so the whole argument for a premium because of micro strategy being this rare leverage way to play bitcoin or rare even way to get access to bitcoin without buying it directly that has gone away a little bit  a little bit of a hit yeah  so we ll see if that keeps up that premium continues to widen let s also talk about rh it s in focus today after the furniture retailer reported a wider than expected first quarter loss here uh the shares down the most in a single day  going back to march of 2020 basically the company has been on a big expansion  right it s expanded into europe  although it at first expanded into some secondary markets in europe  sort of as a test case it s building itself up as the broader luxury brand like a ralph lauren  for example  it s open restaurants  it has these fancy new show rooms  um and it seems like it s costing it a lot of money and that then feeding through to the results and by the way  co gary friedman on the call  you hear him mincing  no words on the fed uh saying i think they re gonna be  this was on a call with analysts  of course  i think they ll be behind the curve he says it relates to inflation so i think it could be behind the curve as it relates to timing of when to to cut those rates so in our view  our view is probably a little bit more negative than it was a quarter ago i think a quarter ago he told the street we were feeling a little bit more optimistic that there would be rate cuts in the housing market we begin to mink  we move in a sustained manner well  that would be in his interest  wouldn t you would cut sooner and get not sounding happy although he is also so really trying to cater more to ultra luxury at this point and you could argue that those folks are not as sensitive to changes in interest rates so does that also say something about that strategy leather couch you re saying it s not as  not as sensitive i  you know  if you re buying  what is it  5000 couches and up yeah  there was a  14 000 couch i saw cited in one article i bet it looked nice i bet so sure it did all right moving on  tempest a i making its wall street debut trading started today on the nasdaq the company pricing its offering at  37 per share so this one was um an instrument so it makes  it makes its debut um they re kind of  they re using a i to process medical data um they ve actually been around for some time  julie  they were actually found in 2015  described their businesses creating intelligent diagnostics for precision medicine in terms of the financials posted revenue of 532 million in 2023 that was up from 321 million the year earlier it looks like they re still losing money that lost about roughly 200 million and 23 of course  not unusual for a tech company to go public uh posting losses and investors will often look through that  especially if you have a i in the name yeah  although it s become less typical  i feel like you have more companies more at a more mature level coming public and maybe posting profit but this not at that case  it is  it it sounds interesting what they do they connect your lab results to your personal clinical data to kind of analyze  i guess using a i so  you know  we ll see uh how they continue to go they did rise as much as 18  at one point during the day but as we could see they re up about 10 5  ceo eric lefkofsky also  by the way  co founder groupon  fact  interesting  very different business i don t know what lessons he s applying  but he must be applying hopefully he ll come talk to us and we can ask him so that s a formal invitation to eric there you go all right still to come it s the latest edition of our series goodbye goodbye and take a deeper dive into two stocks to help you make the best moves to your portfolio stay tuned  more market domination on your friend it s a big noisy universe of stocks out there welcome to  goodbye or good bye our goal to help cut through that noise to navigate the best moves for your portfolio today we re taking a look at business strategies of two companies in the tech realm i m here with red needle ventures founder and very good to see you thanks for being here so let s get to your by stock first of all  here  we are looking at palo alto networks and this company it s up over the last year  although it s a little bit of volatility as we can see from this chart cyber security has been a really interesting space and we ve seen some sort of volatility within it as well let s talk about platform i  i even have trouble saying this word platform which i started seeing a lot more in the discussions of companies like palo alto and crowds street what  what does this mean it s a lot of syllables to say  small businesses  enterprises want to buy their cyber security solutions from one place from one company right now  historically  you know  businesses have had to go out and put a hodgepodge of different pieces of the elements of cyber security together and they re saying  you know what it s really inefficient  it creates vulnerability we want to go to one place and palo alto has really been leaning into being a solutions provider hitting on a lot of those different vertical solutions well  that explained it better than any of the companies that i heard themselves discussing it and palo alto has also been winning big contracts from big companies  big ones we united health care is a big one that got announced a big strategic relationship announced also recently julie with ibm and what palo alto is going to be doing is providing a lot of the cloud and cybersecurity solutions that ibm is going to its consulting clients and saying  look  this is the go to place to come to so that was a big one from a go to market perspective and then finally  also  there s the free cash flow that we are seeing at the company that it could potentially be growing yes  i love this you and i talked about this a lot i m a free cash flow girl  37  free margin for palo alto networks that s right now  that s before they continue to see some of the efficiencies they re very focused on cost a lot of the young businesses  the start ups  the growing companies i speak to if they could pick their acquire  they d like to be bought by palo alto networks and these guys have got the cash and it s growing so you think if they re going out there to make acquisitions  it s going to be of technology  it s going to be of start ups rather than other like rather than a big sort of acquisition i think so  i think that actually if you look at value creation over time  finding homes  finding tons where you can really get synergies without the risk that comes from doing a big merger of equals or consuming a massive acquisition with a potential class of clash of cultures i think palo alto is going to be able to get some chunky  some sizable acquisitions but nothing that s too big to swallow and that way you add to the functionality of that big platform as well  filling in those gaps we like to talk about the risks potentially here and you know  they re spending money  they re being aggressive one of the downsides of that well  this one way is one where you have to believe in execution you ve got to believe you ve got leadership setting clear goals  holding their teams accountable and making sure that they re super focused on how they re actually doing what they say they re going to do it sounds simple it s very hard to do in practice in this case  palo alto has been going after a really bold i think strategy to get market share they ve been going to some big potential clients and saying if you are using an existing alternative provider  we will on board you and take you on for a couple of months for free so that you re not doubled  you know  you re not double spending as long as that is an incentive for you to move over that s pretty bold it means a couple of losses on some of those accounts as they win them  but it s working at the moment it has to continue for the share price to keep heading up into the right and before we head to your goodbye  the do you hold palo alto i do hold palo alto and i ve been adding that share price you had at the beginning when you ve seen those dips i ve been going back oh  interesting all right let s get to the stock you re avoiding and that is paypal and you re not on avoiding this one the stock is down over the past year but let s get to why you re avoiding it here while palo alto has that strategy  you don t think paypal has it here s the thread both of them are execution plays i ll come back to that but this is also about paypal when you take a big step back  this is a business that touches 25  of global e commerce i look at that and say this thing should be winning  it should be winning on data aggregation it should be winning in a i applications it should be winning and gaining share and cross selling this new ceo has now been in the seat about nine months i ve been waiting to hear here s the big bold vision that we ve got a la pala ala networks crickets haven t heard it yet yeah  i mean  part of that  i guess is a go to market strategy now we  we ve been talking a lot about go to market strategies with these yeah  enterprise players basically what it means is sales strategy how do we  how do we get our product out there to more people and sell more stuff that s exactly right and so what paypal has been doing is moving the deck chairs a little bit they ve said that we re going to go after market verticals  we re going to stop selling on a product by product basis and selling on a solutions basis to the different user bases but again  if it s not going behind a big strategy that what you re doing feels a little bit like tweaking around the edges and i haven t seen really groundbreaking results coming out of these tactics so far well  and to your point  paypal is enormous i mean  i can t  i can t tell you how many times i click on that check out using but  you know  if they  if they don t do these other things  maybe that market share dominance will not last well  i think that s right  julie and also this is one where i ve looked at the rise and rise of stripe  for example  i ve looked at the rise and rise of the b npl players like a firm after pay cloner and i look at that and i sort of want to tear my hair up because i m like  where s paypal right they had the first mover advantage to be able to take what are products what i ve just said a firm after pay  those were products they didn t have to become enterprises  had paypal got its act together and gone after it and it didn t so i m concerned about market share and then on the flip side  what could work for paypal  i guess to put it simply is if start doing all this stuff that you re talking about well  exactly so alex chris again  i have deep respect for him he got into the seat four months ago he went on tv and he said we re going to shock the world  right we ve got this great stat  start with this huge amount of penetration we re going to shock the world well  you know  i m ready to be shocked let s see it yeah  it s still  he came  he then came out with an  i don t even remember what the announcement was that s innovation i don t really remember exactly that s the point there s a shrug there s a bit of a shrug when it comes to some of the paypal innovation and i m ready to be shocked even if it s got risk right i like the fact that palo alto network says risk to the strategy  but at least it s got one yeah  they re taking  they re taking that risk any position in paypal one way i sold out so i think my money s been doing what i m saying ok  and good to see you thanks for coming in and thank you so much for watching goodbye or goodbye we ll be bringing you new episodes next week at 3 30 p m  eastern all right  let s get to our call of the day check out sheriff of shopify they are on the rise is coming after a new note from evercore i si upgrading the name to outperform from in line and this is ever core s mark mahaney  of course  well known  well respected analys to folks pay attention to mahaney does upgrade this one to outperform price target 75 says there s been this pull back on this one and  and the stock is down about 12  this year and that offers mahany telling his clients an attractive entry points  his valuation and estimates he thinks now sufficiently de risk yeah and he s looking at the long term here when he s looking at the stock  he says there is a very resilient long thesis and he talks about a couple of things that support it he talks about the very large total addressable market  strong competitive position  up market activity and clear track record of successful product innovation so he s got a lot of reasons he likes it he was just sort of  it sounds like for this entry point with the stock i mean  it s come back a little bit lately as you can see from that chart  but also still is kind of weak year to date yeah  maybe not  not on an island i mean  most of the financial analysts come this name do think it s a b yes  we ll see if it goes to that  75 price target here we go still to come  get out the sunscreen and pack those bags we re taking all  we re talking all things travel from cruises to airlines next on market domination shares of cruise lines hitting choppy water in today s trade viking holdings royal caribbean carnival cruise lines in norwegian they all came under pressure after b of a analysts called out what they said was modest softening in ocean cruise prices during the month of june so it was interesting here  julia  i mean  the the companies obviously had been reporting earlier results and i thought  you know  the kind of message of the takeaway was it was broadly positive i mean  there s still lots of talk about record bookings  for example  but here comes b of a and their team gets to work  pull out their pencils and then conclude that in june  there was indeed they say modestly softer pricing um in ocean markets relative to early may the analysts saying 40  of cruise itineraries had softer pricing compared with 33  in may um and you saw the stocks reacting to that i mean  on the flip side  if you dig into  i mean  it feels like yes  there was a sell off on this but also maybe there were other reasons buying the sell off i mean  if you dig into this and you can see from that chart it s really volatile according to their survey  at least if you look at the pricing that was negative um in the past month  that 40  figure you get 33  the month before that 21  60  24 you know  it s  it s  it bounces around a lot and it seems like that the cruise lines are very reactive when it comes to pricing  dynamic pricing that s something we ve heard from them before that they do so it s hard to know how seriously to take this i mean  one interesting minor note from this is that they also did a survey of viking pricing for the first time viking  the european river boat uh operator that just came public and they said there s less volatility in that market i mean  there aren t  there isn t as much competition  i don t think in the river cruise market so maybe that s part of the reason why  but it had flat pricing essentially also as to that chart pointed out i mean  some of these names have had some world caribbean more than 50  in the past 12 months well  sticking with travel  josh airlines have a potential problem  travel demand is projected to hit a record high this summer based on earnings forecast but the issue  ongoing problems at boeing are hindering airlines access to new planes and limiting potential for growth potentially we re looking at how to navigate the big picture with the yahoo finance playbook joining us now  peter third bridge  global sector lead for industrial materials and energy alongside george ferguson bloomberg intelligence  senior analyst covering the aerospace defense and airline industries guys  it is great to see you thanks for being here i think you guys have a little bit different views from each other on the capacity constraints that are out there peter  i want to start with you and and how you see it for the industry there what s the demand supply match up looking like right now well  demands been healthy it s been growing for four years now um the problem is  you know  airlines do want these new planes  they can t get them  they re keeping the ones that they do have in the air longer for sure but there s still some maintenance constraints too that need to go on  particularly around  around engines so it is  you know  capacity is growing it s just not growing as fast as the airlines hope and you ve got  you know  companies like united who ve got very ambitious targets out to 2026 that they ve had to temper that a bit so  you know  we ll see  it doesn t seem like boeing s uh problems are gonna be sorted anytime soon and it s not like airbus can go any faster than  than they already are a and george le le let s um get you in as well maybe we ll start there with that same big picture question george demand supply dynamics how are you thinking about it yeah  so we put a report out this week on  on this question because it s been overhanging the market here for  i think  you know  for months now uh there s definitely a lot of concern that there s not enough lift we basically analyze profitability for all the major airlines globally and we looked at their ebita margins which would be margins before  you know  you pay for any changes in your capital structure because debt  maybe you took on during the pandemic or whatever so we looked at ebita margins compared to last year compared to 2019 and 2016  2 of the best years in the last decade and most airlines aren t achieving those margins so  i d say there s record travel and that s because the airlines are putting  putting record schedules up into the air but probably  thank god they can t get all those airplanes because they cross margins even more when will they slow down i think when they start having uh losses and they  they re not there yet but we  when we look at profitability and return on invested capital measures  they are just not performing like they did last decade  there s too much capacity that s so interesting and i mean  the airlines have always sort of struggled with this capacity  how to get that balance right peter  are there any airlines that are  are navigating this better than some of the others either because of the circumstances  they re not as exposed to say boeing or because execution wise they re doing a better job well  i think the  the one of the big problems that are not talking about that make airlines less profitable than they were pre panic is labor costs you know  you ve negotiated with the union  you step up 30 to 40  which has been the rate what you ve seen and then you stay there  you know  so this has been a dragon  whether it s pilots  mechanics  uh flight attendants  they re all getting  getting more money but uh you know  delta airlines has been the one that has found a way to navigate this uh better  better than others um  extremely loyal business  uh travelers  a very good fleet  clean balance sheet um  no real need for like major investments the way  let s say american had to do a  a big refresh on their fleet prepa uh borrowed a lot of money to do things like that or united as we talked about a bit earlier with this aggressive uh growth strategy that they have but i think kind of the unhidden or the  you know  the unappreciated asset that delta has is their tech ops business that allows them to do their own maintenance  repair and overhaul  which  you know  we started seeing engine problems last summer um that has grounded a lot of airbus planes  you know  they had uh jetblue and  and a few others a bit more  but uh delta seems to be the one that has navigated best you  you  you agree with that george  would you  would you say um delta  if you were to look across  you know  the industry seems to be navigating this mo most effectively definitely  i  i we totally agree there so i think if you look at the us market  it s delta and united that are performing better than all the  the other airlines  i think that s a function of premium  both premium leisure travel and business travel demand uh and long haul  i think long haul is generally performing better than short haul now right so if you re going inside a continent i think things are very competitive because there s a lot of low cost carriers that will compete uh you know  with you  even if you re a full service carrier uh to carry those passengers so  fares are under pressure but i  i think still this summer you ll see good fares into europe  pretty good fares uh into asia pacific and that helps delta and united the most in the us george do you think that the whole labor issue here and both the difficulty of flying  finding staff and also the higher wages to pay them do you think that that is a problem that s just here to stay so i do and so we ve written a report on this as well it s under the bloomberg uh service uh  so when we looked at  uh  retirements that were coming  um  we use airline pilot  central com  which i think is fairly reputable but i  i will admit  you know  we  we could sort of dive in and get the  the numbers exactly ourselves but when we looked at their numbers on retirements  we think retirements are going to peak 2026 2027 i think it  i think it s sort of similar to the dynamics in the rest of the economy where a lot of people  boomers came in a lot of these businesses and they re retiring now in  in larger numbers  pilots are really hard to replace because they re highly trained  takes years and years to get trained up to get into a cockpit uh  and they re the ones getting sort of the 20  increases at the last  uh  pay negotiation i suspect they may get that similar number actually  maybe not as high as 20 but they may get pretty high numbers mid decade when they  uh  when they do this again so  yeah  that  that s a big problem right now with airlines 11 other question i have peter um and i realize this sounds like a smaller question  but just from a consumer point of view  i m interested to get your take you see this trend of airlines raising bag fees  is that  is that a smart way to raise more revenue or do you risk alienating your customer how do you think about it well  you know  look once  once  you know  one airline does it and it follows another and then  and then another  it s just gonna be the way it is like we eliminated change fees  you know  during the pandemic at some point that s going to come back to it is a  it is a valuable source of revenue um that the airlines  you know  will  you know  will pull on at some point you know  it s part of the prescription i see that elliott as you know  the activist for southwest is to  you know  introduce more bag fees but uh these companies are  you know  are trying to grow profits and that s one more way to do it  i mean  george  it s not just the bag fees right i mean  at this point i feel like i m paying up to not sit on a cardboard box on the plane you know  it  it s got  like there  it s  everything is  is in these tiers and i sort of agree with josh here at what point do you risk alienation although i guess your choice is just not to fly at all yeah  i think that s about right i think everywhere you go now the revenue managers are looking for different ways to slice and dice the airplane cabin and figure out what they can get people to pay for right and so the challenge is to find more things to sell and in the old days those are things you and i just got  i guess got for free  got by luck when we got  you know  an  an exit aisle or something like that uh and so that s the new formula for increasing revenue delta does it i think better than uh most others i think it may be here to stay and hard to avoid peter george gonna leave it there thanks guys for joining the show today appreciate it thank you while we are wrapping up today s market domination don t go anywhere we ve got you covered with all the action following the closing bell stay tuned for market domination overtime ',

                        'The battle to boost the economy via retail is far from lost according to Shopify’s State of Commerce Report. Consumers and businesses continue to face strong macroeconomic headwinds across Europe. And the study notes that a value conundrum exists between the two.Despite half (50%) of European consumers looking for the best value they can find, the majority (82%) of businesses are passing on some, or all, cost increases to the customer. This is slightly lower in the UK at 81%. The vast majority (85% in Europe, 82% in the UK) of consumers would be more loyal if brands were to offer them something. For example, high quality goods or service, promotions, and surprises. But consumers also still expect a human touch to their shopping experience.However, only 6% of UK businesses surveyed said they were planning to significantly invest in customer experience this year. According to Shopify, this represents a missed opportunity for many businesses. The report recommends that businesses find ways to either reduce prices. Alternatively, they should offer additional value if they are to maintain brand loyalty and keep consumers on side.The report uncovers what businesses are prioritising and what consumers across the continent currently feel and want.Shopify State of Commerce Report - key European findings include:Discretionary spending has reduced over the last 12 months for almost half (46%) of consumers.Over half (53%) said a better price/value of a product was one reason why they have previously bought a brand different to their usual choice. Meanwhile 23% would switch to a rival brand if it meant saving money.Over two-thirds (67%) think it is important brands offer a good integrated experience between online and offline, growing to 74% of those who have increased their spend over the last twelve months.Almost half (47%) said they expect brands to offer a tech-enabled shopping experience, while 35% said they would be more loyal to brands offering them.Almost two-thirds (64%) believe AI will make at least one aspect of shopping easier. But businesses have concerns about delivering a less authentic or human experience to shoppers.Deann Evans, Managing Director, EMEA of Shopify, said: “This study provides actionable insights and trends from thousands of retailers and consumers on selling and shopping in 2024 and beyond. It shows surprising and delighting shoppers should remain a priority. While new technology, including generative AI tools, offer new ways to engage consumers and drive crucial efficiencies, brands should continue to maintain a personal touch. And deliver a consistent experience in every place a customer shops.”Story continuesThe full report is available via this link"85% of shoppers would be more loyal if offered something, from promotions to unexpected surprises" was originally created and published by Electronic Payments International, a GlobalData owned brand. The information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

There are no guarantees, but the earlier you start and the more consistently you invest, the more likely it's something that can happen.Consider this exercise. If you had invested $25,000 in the S&P 500 30 years ago and added $300 monthly, you'd be a millionaire today. That's using the average annual S&P 500 return of about 10%.Not everyone has that much to invest, but if you have an appetite for risk, you could invest in growth stocks that could lead to much higher gains. Consider these two e-commerce powerhouse stocks: MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI) and Global-e Online (NASDAQ: GLBE).1. MercadoLibre: The Amazon of Latin AmericaAmazon referred to a river in South America before it was co-opted by the largest e-commerce company in the world, but since that name was taken, Latin America has its own e-commerce giant. MercadoLibre has developed into an e-commerce powerhouse that's taking a page out of Amazon's playbook and is expanding into new areas, and it's become a formidable growth company.MercadoLibre has been around almost as long as Amazon, but it's still demonstrating incredible growth. Revenue increased 94% year over year (currency neutral) in the 2024 first quarter, driven by both e-commerce and its newer fintech business.Despite pressure in Argentina, which is one of MercadoLibre's three largest markets, the e-commerce business has been reporting strong performance. Gross merchandise volume increased 71% year over year in the first quarter, with momentum across the board. Items sold increased 25%, and unique buyers increased 16%. Items sold per unique buyer were up 7%.Same and next-day penetration was stable year over year at 52%, and that was impacted by buyers choosing slow shipping, a MercadoLibre innovation where Meli+ members can choose a weekly delivery day. Ultimately, that's good for MercadoLibre's expense control.The major growth, though, is happening in fintech. MercadoLibre has an expanding fintech segment that provides digital payments and credit products. Total payment volume increased 86% year over year. Monthly active users were up 38% over last year, and assets under management increased 90% to more than $5.5 billion.This is just the beginning. MercadoLibre has massive potential, and if you invest now, MercadoLibre stock could supercharge your portfolio.2. Global-e: Driving global commerceUnlike most e-commerce companies on this list, Global-e doesn't sell any retail products. It hosts a cross-border e-commerce platform for retailers who are ready for global operations. But it makes it super easy for any company to access a worldwide audience.Story continuesWhen clients sign up, they integrate Global-e's platform into their digital e-commerce channels. International customers can checkout in multiple currencies and get instant customs calculations and delivery options. Many clients have benefited from increased global sales after signing up, and it's a no-brainer tool for retailers looking to boost their top lines.Global-e has been reporting strong growth, but like most companies, it has been decelerating in the inflationary environment. Sales increased 24% year over year in the 2024 first quarter to $146 million. However management expects things to tick up in the back half of the year as it begins to see more results from its new Shopify product.Global-e has a partnership with Shopify, and Shopify recently launched a product called Shopify Markets Pro, which is a white-label service of the Global-e platform. This is available to Shopify's millions of merchants, and management says it's going well. Global-e also recently started a partnership with Wix.com to offer its services to Wix's e-commerce clients.These deals are on top of Global-e's direct clients, which include many of the world's top retailers, like Nordstrom and Macy's as well as high-profile brands like Walt Disney, and recently, Donna Karan. It has a constant supply of new clients in its pipeline to generate growth.Global-e isn't profitable yet on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis, but it has been steadily improving. Adjusted gross margin expanded from 41.4% last year to 45.3% in the first quarter, and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) increased from $14.5 million to $21.3 million. Net loss narrowed from $43 million to $32 million.Global-e is the top player in its industry, and it offers a product that every serious e-commerce retailer would find useful. It's in growth mode, and sales growth could accelerate in an improved economy. It's just getting started, and its stock could be part of a millionaire-maker portfolio.Should you invest $1,000 in MercadoLibre right now?Before you buy stock in MercadoLibre, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and MercadoLibre wasn’t one of them.

                        "Shareholders approved Chipotle's historic 50-for-1 stock split at the company's annual meeting (REUTERS / Reuters)Chipotle (CMG)Shares in Chipotle were higher in pre-market trading as investors are looking forward to its upcoming 50-to-1 stock split.Chipotle Mexican Grill announced back in March a stock split with one of the biggest multiples ever: Each current share will be split into 50 new shares.This means that when markets open on June 26, shareholders will own 50 times as many shares as they did at the close of trading on June 25, but the price of each one will be about one-fiftieth of what it was before.Chief financial officer and chief administrative officer Jack Hartung said the move would help the company \"reward our team members and empower them to have ownership in our company.\"The company has been red-hot this year, gaining about 70% since last November. TD Cowen has raised its price target for Chipotle from $3,500 (£2761.32) to $3,600, signalling a potential upside of 10%.Read more: FTSE 100 LIVE: European equities snap losing streak as London regains stock market crownRowan Street Capital are also optimistic about the fast-food chain prospects.“The best investment ideas are simple. We have previously written about Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. It turned out that this was our best investment idea since starting the fund. The stock is up 10x since we first invested at the end of 2017 (~47% annualized),” their analysts wrote.Autodesk (ADSK)Activist Starboard Value bought a roughly $500m stake in Autodesk, and is pushing for changes at the design-software maker, the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday.Starboard has reportedly held meetings with Autodesk executives in the past few weeks to express their concerns and suggest changes, including enhancing its margins, implementing changes to its board and the management of a recent accounting investigation that negatively impacted the stock.Starboard criticised Autodesk in private conversations with the company for not disclosing the investigation and other material updates until after the company's window for shareholders to nominate director candidates closed in late March, according to the WSJ.It is considering taking legal action to ask for Autodesk's director nomination window to be reopened and for the design-software maker's annual shareholder meeting, currently set for July 16, to be delayed, the report added.Shopify (SHOP)Shopify got a boost on Friday after an analyst at Evercore ISI said now was the time to buy stock in the e-commerce company with shares down this year but the price is being corrected as it remains in the red during pre-market trading.Story continuesEvercore has upgraded the rating of SHOP shares to Outperform, setting a price target of $75. This decision comes after a significant drop in the stock’s value, approximately 30% from its 52-week high.Outperform at Evercore means “the total forecasted return is expected to be greater than the expected total return of the analyst's coverage sector.”Read more: UK housing market steadies despite election uncertaintyThe analyst wrote in a research note that the recent pullback in the stock provides an attractive entry point. Shares of Shopify have dropped 16% this year.Rentokil (RTO.L)Pest control and hygiene firm Rentokil is one of the best performing stocks in the FTSE 100 (^FTSE) this session on the back of a note from RBC Capital Markets.Analysts updated their earnings forecasts for forex (-1% to -2%), and expect first-half results to be in line with the market's expectations, \"with acceleration of US organic growth through this year\".The stock has also been boosted after activist investor Nelson Peltz amassed a “significant” stake in the company and has “reached out to discuss ideas and initiatives to improve shareholder value”.Rentokil has been a volatile stock, with the London-listed business struggling in recent years, with its expansion into the US falling flat on softer demand for its products.Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said Peltz is likely to facilitate a big shake-up at the business.\"[Rentokil] has struggled in comparison with its US peer Rollins, both in share price terms and financial performance,\" he says.\"Given Rentokil does have a large chunk of its business across the Atlantic this could include a push to shift its primary listing to the US.\"Watch: Tesla board should take on an 'independent, active' roleDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

                        'Apple upgraded, Shopify initiated: Wall Street\'s top analyst callsThe most talked about and market moving research calls around Wall Street are now in one place. Here are today\'s research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.Top 5 Upgrades: DA Davidson upgraded Apple (AAPL) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $230, up from $200. The firm believes the artificial intelligence capabilities Apple unveiled at the Worldwide Developers Conference will lead to an iPhone upgrade cycle.Exane BNP Paribas upgraded Robert Half (RHI) to Outperform from Underperform with an $80 price target. The firm upgraded the staffing sector, expecting growth to improve and for the earnings downgrade cycle to turn positive.Exane BNP Paribas upgraded ManpowerGroup (MAN) to Outperform from Underperform with a $92 price target. The firm believes the staffing sector is close to its lows and momentum will improve.BTIG upgraded Staar Surgical (STAA) to Buy from Neutral with a $46 price target. The company has reset numbers to the point that they are in a good spot to be beat with unit volume growth expectations essentially zero in fiscal 2024, the firm tells investors in a research note.Noble Capital upgraded AZZ Inc. (AZZ) to Outperform from Market Perform with a $95 price target. With the new greenfield plant construction in Washington, Missouri expected to be completed in fiscal year 2025, the firm sees "an increasingly favorable cash flow growth profile" and thinks AZZ could more aggressively pursue acquisitions once its effort to deleverage the balance sheet is complete.Top 5 Downgrades:Exane BNP Paribas downgraded Comcast (CMCSA) to Underperform from Neutral with a $34 price target. The firm believes the end of the Affordable Connectivity Program will bring an increasingly volatile period across the U.S. telecommunications and cable space.Wedbush downgraded CoreCivic (CXW) to Neutral from Outperform with a price target of $14, down from $19, after the Immigration and Customs Enforcement notified the company of its intention to terminate their service agreement for the South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley, TexasB. Riley downgraded Squarespace (SQSP) to Neutral from Buy with a $43 price target after the company\'s board accepted an all-cash offer of $44 per share from private equity group Permira.JPMorgan downgraded Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF) to Neutral from Overweight with a price target of $17, down from $23. The firm sees weakening fundamentals, growing capex needs through 2028 and a lack of near-term growth, unlike most peers in the space.Deutsche Bank downgraded NexPoint Residential (NXRT) to Hold from Buy with an unchanged price target of $38. The firm says its thesis of an "excessively discounted valuation" on interest rate concerns has largely played out.Story continuesTop 5 Initiations: JPMorgan initiated coverage of Shopify (SHOP) with an Overweight rating and $74 price target. The firm believes the company\'s product breadth, ease of use, and scale are "distinct competitive advantages that will continue to fuel industry-leading growth."Bernstein initiated coverage of On Holding (ONON) with an Outperform rating and $50 price target. The firm believes the company can sustain "strong double-digit growth."Citi initiated coverage of GE Vernova (GEV) with a Neutral rating and $183 price target. The firm believes GE Vernova is well positioned to benefit from increasingly favorable demand trends across much of its portfolio, but given an elevated valuation multiple that largely reflects expected favorable demand trends and improving profitability, the stock\'s near-term risk/reward is relatively balanced.Evercore ISI initiated coverage of Confluent (CFLT) with an Outperform rating and $35 price target. The firm believes Confluent is the "runaway market leader" in the nascent $60B data streaming market.Goldman Sachs initiated coverage of Rocket Lab (RKLB) with a Neutral rating and $4.50 price target. The firm says the company is currently EBITDA and free cash flow negative, in an investment cycle with Neutron, and the level of, and path to, future profitability has uncertainty.',

                        "The bull market continues to march forward, with the S&P 500 index up 38% since the end of 2022. It's been fueled by tech stocks, but beaten-down names in e-commerce and travel have outperformed the index and are still trading off their previous highs.Read why these three fool.com contributors believe Carnival (NYSE: CCL), Shopify (NYSE: SHOP), and MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI) are timely buys today.The tide is risingJeremy Bowman (Carnival): Shares of Carnival, the world's largest cruise line, have been riding the waves up and down for some time after crashing during the pandemic. Investors seem to be unsure if the company can return to full health after taking on so much debt and diluting shareholders to survive the COVID crisis.Meanwhile, the cruise industry is notoriously risky as economic weakness, black swan events like the pandemic, and natural disasters can all sink cruise stocks.However, June could prove to be a prime buying opportunity for Carnival stock. First, we're entering peak travel season, and recent reports from airlines and online travel agencies like Booking Holdings indicate travel demand remains on the rise. U.S. airlines are forecasting record summer travel up 6.3% from last year, which is reflecting a strong recovery from the pandemic.Investors will also be paying close attention to the Federal Reserve's rate-setting meeting later this month. Signs that it could decide to lower interest rates would give Carnival stock a boost. That would lower rates on its variable debt and make it easier to refinance its fixed-rate borrowings.Lastly, we'll also get an update on the business' performance later this month when the company reports second-quarter earnings.Carnival has shown strong momentum in recent quarters, including record revenue and booking levels, and we'll get some insights into the key summer travel season. The company also has a pattern of beating estimates in its recent reports as well.The cruise company is still down 15% from its 52-week high even as the broad market is setting new records. With a strong earnings report and some help from the macro economy, this top travel stock could finish June considerably higher.This e-commerce company is still going strongJohn Ballard (Shopify): Shopify is everywhere online. It helps millions of merchants across 175 countries set up online storefronts, and it has delivered tremendous growth in recent years.Shopify is a solid business. It generates recurring revenue through subscriptions to its platform, but also makes money from other services, including shipping labels, the Shopify App Store, and payment processing. It shares in the success of its merchant customers, which is key to its own success.Story continuesAnnual revenue has exploded from $389 million in 2016 to over $7 billion in 2023. It continues to grow at double-digit rates because the global opportunity is massive. There are roughly 400 million small and medium-size businesses worldwide, which can power Shopify's business for many years.One reason more businesses will sign up for Shopify is innovation. The company is starting to implement artificial intelligence in its services to help merchants make data-driven decisions in a timely manner. This could be a valuable tool down the road for small businesses.Shopify is also seeing success in attracting larger enterprises to the platform. Its business-to-business gross merchandise volume more than doubled year over year in the first quarter, which is pointing to a big opportunity.The stock is up 76% since the end of 2022, but it's still down 66% from its previous high. With the premium taken out of the stock's valuation, investors are getting a fair price for this e-commerce leader.An e-commerce and fintech powerhouseJennifer Saibil (MercadoLibre): MercadoLibre stock has crushed the market over its lifetime, and even though it's not a young company anymore, it's still demonstrating massive growth with much more to come.First and foremost is its e-commerce business. Like Amazon in the U.S., MercadoLibre is the dominant e-commerce player in its 18 Latin American markets. It's maintaining very high growth, including a 71% (currency neutral) year-over-year increase in gross merchandise volume in the 2024 first quarter.The business benefits from a flywheel effect: It continues to invest in its logistics network and delivery capabilities, leading to faster shipments, and that leads to higher sales, stronger loyalty, and greater scale.It also recently launched a membership program similar to Amazon Prime to generate more engagement and encourage shoppers to rely even more on MercadoLibre for their regular shopping.The company started a fintech segment to help the underbanked population in some of its markets access its platform, and that has turned into a high-growth, high-momentum business with many new services. It offers digital payments, credit cards, other credit products, and more, and millions of customers are now on its fintech platform.Monthly active users increased 38% year over year in the first quarter to 49 million. Total payment volume was up 86% over last year, and assets under management increased 90%.There are many directions in which MercadoLibre can take this business, and it's expanding into new services all the time. It recently applied for a bank license in Mexico to open up its first attempt at a proper bank, and its goal is to become the largest digital bank there. That's a broad ambition, and the company could turn into a Latin American financial powerhouse.Overall, MercadoLibre reported a 94% increase in revenue in the first quarter along with rising profits. These results aren't unusual, and with its reach and opportunities, it should be able to keep it up for a long time.Should you invest $1,000 in Carnival Corp. right now?Before you buy stock in Carnival Corp., consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Carnival Corp. wasn’t one of them.

                        "In an environment where e-commerce companies have performed well recently, Shopify's (NYSE: SHOP) stock has struggled. Since surging above $91 per share in February, lowered sales guidance seems to have weighed on sentiment. Consequently, it sells at a 33% discount to its 52-week high.That leaves investors questioning whether they should take advantage of the discounted stock price or hold out for a deeper discount. Still, with its market leadership and continuing growth, it might be time to add a position, and here's why.The state of ShopifyIn one sense, Shopify looks like it is continuing to prosper. It first grabbed the attention of both prospective customers and investors by producing an e-commerce platform that stood out because merchants could customize it without any coding knowledge. Reasonable pricing and a speedy site also helped it stand out.It also built a full-fledged ecosystem that could handle most of its customers' other needs. If they require help with email marketing, handling payments, managing inventory, or raising capital, Shopify offers services to address all that.Grand View Research forecasts a compound annual growth rate of 19% for the e-commerce industry through 2030, and Shopify appears to have capitalized on this burgeoning opportunity.In the first quarter, its revenue of $1.9 billion rose 23% from year-ago levels. Subscription revenue drove much of this growth, increasing 34% as customers continued to take to its platform.Investors should note that the failed attempt to enter the logistics business continued to weigh on financials as the company took a $342 million charge related to the sale of that business. That brought a net loss of $281 million, down from the $77 million profit in the year-ago quarter.What might be hurting Shopify's stockNonetheless, a one-time charge is unlikely to derail Shopify stock. Instead, what seems to be affecting it is expectations. For the second quarter, the company forecast a high-teens rate of revenue growth. While still robust, it significantly lags the 23% growth in the first quarter and the 26% it reported in 2023.The price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio above 850 probably does not reflect its valuation due to the company moving in and out of profitability, though a forward P/E ratio of 63 is expensive by nearly any measure.However, given its condition, investors should pay more attention to its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio, which now stands at 11. That's not a record low, but it more closely resembles its valuation in 2016, when Shopify was an up-and-coming software company far from earning a profit. That might indicate the stock is actually undervalued in a relative sense.Story continuesSHOP PS Ratio ChartAlso, the slowdown in revenue growth might not happen as quickly as Shopify's second-quarter forecast indicates. Analysts predict 21% revenue growth in 2024 and 20% next year.And the company outperformed analyst revenue expectations in each of the last eight quarters. Thus, investors should not only expect a slower sales decline but also remain open to the possibility of Shopify reinvigorating revenue growth.Buy ShopifyConsidering the state of the stock, investors have probably overreacted to the company's declining revenue increases.Admittedly, slowing growth is natural even for growth stocks, and some valuation metrics could lead investors to believe that the shares are too expensive.But Shopify continues attracting new customers, and history indicates that its slowing might occur more gradually than the company has indicated. With a P/S ratio near historical lows, this stock could experience a dramatic recovery as investor sentiment improves.Should you invest $1,000 in Shopify right now?Before you buy stock in Shopify, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Shopify wasn’t one of them.

Nuveen Head of Municipals Dan Close joins the show to discuss the benefits of investing in municipal bonds.This post was written by Angel SmithVideo TranscriptIt's 10 a.m. here in New York City.I'm Madison Mills alongside Alexandra Can.Now we're going to dive into the catalyst moving markets today.Apple joins in on the A I hype announcing new features and a partnership with open A I that could bring generative A I directly to customers.Is this enough to boost lagging iphone sales will discuss.And Tesla shareholders expected to vote on CEO Elon Musk, $56 billion pay package on Thursday.We discuss what this means for the company's future and outside of big tech market face another big test on Wednesday with CP I and the F decision in focus will track how the data move markets.But first we have to talk about today is a big story.Apples A I announcements, the new features called Apple Intelligence will only be available on a limited number of devices including the iphone 15 and upcoming 16.This comes as iphone sales have been under pressure in racing quarters.Is this enough to offer a boost?We spoke to GD A Davidson managing director about how A I changes Apple's position among its competitors.Here's what he had to say.We think it took the lead because again, everybody else has to try to fit their solutions elsewhere or it really doesn't have access to the consumer and the consumer information.Apple has our information, right?So this speaks to the tagline that Apple used, right?A I for the rest of us, a bit of an homage to the 19 eighties when they had the Mac book out a computer for the rest of us and really the personalization of Apple and how they have access to the customer data and they really want to double down on making sure that all these A I features are for the benefit of the consumers.Story continuesSo that means if you have a meeting coming up, Apple can say, hey, you're going to late to this if you don't do XYZ.So a little, a little creepy, but you know, they also said that they want to protect people's privacy as much as possible that is not going to train open A I models.So we'll see once that goes into practice and this is adopted more if that becomes an issue.Well, it's such a great point and this is the key sort of catalyst for Apple moving forward.Are they going to be able to continue to keep consumer privacy in mind?Which has been a key really success point for them in the past, the ability to prioritize consumer privacy.They do say that every time you're going to be utilizing a track G BT powered function on the iphone.You're going to get prompted with a request of whether or not that's OK, but that will inevitably send your data over to open A I.So I think a big question moving forward will be consumer comfort with open A I versus Apple.Those are two different functions there in the degree to which consumers even know about.That will also be another question does look like Apple is moving to the upside here.So interesting to see investors maybe being a little bit more positive today, coming back off of those lows yesterday and continuing this conversation around Apple, we initially saw muted response from investors.After those announcements, we were talking about shares moving to the upside over 3% here.Today.We have one of those investors here with us.We've got Apple shareholder and CEO of Mahoney Asset Management.It's great to speak with you.I know that you did not change your positioning after the news over the past 24 hours here from Apple.But you know a really interesting point about the impact of the announcements that we've been hearing from Apple here.I'm curious what was missing from the announcement that would have made you a little bit more enthusiastic because in reading your note, I feel like I can shot summarize it as just a big shrug to the news.Well, again, I I think long term, it's great.You have this huge buyback in place.100 and $10 billion buy back there.A couple of shekels here, you have a huge upgrade cycle that's gonna come out of this.I mean, there's 270 million phones out there that are 55 years or older, that's a big opportunity.But as far as the technology again, II I just on a lot of other technology research, you know, they thought yawn, they spend a lot of time on sur which I like Siri.Hope sir does a little bit more like like Siri on steroids with this new uh A I model and so forth.But I don't really see it as a, as a yawn as more just like this is Apple.You know, they have 2.2 billion devices out there last year, they had 2 billion devices.Tim Cook did a great job kind of pivoting our focus from hardware sales to really services.And this is really where this it's gonna blossom.So it's not so much a yawn as it is.This is what's expected.You have this many uh customers, you know, tweak here, tweak there, join the, join the party and I think they, they'll succeed.Does it have explosive upside like NVIDIA?No explosive upside by other areas in, in A I not necessarily, but there's a pretty good Apple put when you have 100 and $10 billion a share buyback underneath you So where, what more do you want to see when it comes to Apple?Where do you think that upside lies?And we should mention that the stock is now hitting an intra day high as investors are starting to digest some of those new features.So it seems like even though it might have been a bit of a, I don't know what this means moving forward yesterday today, we're seeing that chair reaction in the positive.So for you, what do you want more of here?So what I would like to see more of is is better integration from the Mac to the ipad to the iphone.You're starting to see that but to really worth that.And really Siri being the head, you know, kind of the head person there putting all those things together, as you mentioned, scheduling appointments, reminded of appointments, there's one app on that.So it was kind of cool like if you're supposed to pick someone up on an air plane uh at, at the airport, it tells you kind of oh the airport, you know, you should be leaving soon, you should be leaving in 10 minutes if you want to meet, meet that person.So there's gonna be a lot of applications, I guess it's just kind of overwhelming the amount of, of applications uh A I that could go about again, the biggest thing is they have all these customers and they want Apple to take the lead.And I'm not sure necessarily, Apple is taking a total, uh, leap of faith into this.I think they're kinda ok. We'll do it, but we'll put it on top of a I, we'll put it on top of Surrey as opposed to kind of blazing a new trail.Well, one question I have is who's going to foot the bill for everything that you just described.Ken Apple saying they're not gonna pass off the cost for chat G BT to customers.Does that mean Apple takes on those costs?And to what extent is that a headwind for their profit margins?Right?But th this is a monetization area that they haven't had before.So, you know, even it's a small piece of the pie because it's percentage breakouts with developers and so forth.I mean, it's kind of complex how they're gonna do it, but in the end, they're in the driver's seat and that these companies have to come to Apple if they want to play.So I think it's still gonna be a pay to play model much like that is on the App store as we see it.So you're saying that the ability to charge customers for utilizing specific A I features is going to outpace the cost of those features for Apple.I I believe so, I believe so, look, they have a lot of different avenues they could take this with.Um But I, I think that's probably the best way to monetize the site to be able to have happy customers and to entice others to this upgrade cycle.Look, we're in this mix here.I've been telling investors we could hit a low with Apple over the summer time.As why would you want to upgrade your, you know, your phone here?Why not wait for the 15 or the 16 and so forth so we could hit a little low.Um But then again, once, once you see that a cool feature and you see it on Instagram or your friends using it, you know, they're the early adapters usually to the stuff of technology and then behind are people like me say, 00, you can do this, you can do that.And so that is where Apple is gonna be able to monetize the site more.There's new features and new ways and new apps all around A I and Ken, we spoke with Gil Laia from D A Davidson earlier this morning.He said that when it comes to the competitive landscape in A I that Apple is in the lead.Do you agree with that?Huh?I'm not.So I would say NVIDIA is in the lead.I mean, this is pretty much drawn up by the CEO of NVIDIA who said by the way, when a second or third inning of this cycle, I'm not sure Apple is in lead, but they don't have to be in the lead.You know, they're the big, they have 2.2 billion devices out there.So it's, it's, you know, developers and all them could come to Apple, but I don't think necessarily they're taking the lead.I would say NVIDIA um kind of in the round of that, you know, $3 trillion market cap and you know, just added on a trillion in the last six weeks.Kind of shows that the video is probably the leader in the space, not Apple, but still Apple doesn't have to necessarily be the leader in the space because they have all these customers uh obviously, and and the ecosystem as you know, once you're in an iphone, typically you're gonna stay there.You don't want to do your photos, don't lose your contacts.It integrates with your Mac, integrates with your ipad.So they create this great ecosystem and they could just add services on top of that with the base that they have.I think it's still a win, win for shareholders.I wanna talk about one other risk for Apple.And that is Elon Musk.He posted on X yesterday saying that if Apple integrates open A I at the OS level, then Apple devices would be banned at his company and he's calling it an unacceptable security violation.How big of a risk is that for you and your asset holdings here?Right.So it's just still trying to figure that out.And again, we have to take Elon Musk word, I mean, he's a very smart individual and he's always kind of looking ahead where things are.But again, um I, I would think there's an opt in uh you opt into this uh A I platform or A I chat et whatever and it tells you here's disclaimers.So it's really up to the consumer to decide if they want to go in.So I don't think Apple is just gonna just take your data, data and feed it over there.I think they're gonna have a few speed bumps that I think consumers will be happy with.Remember, Apple has always been high integrity about, about collecting data.They have all this data.They're not selling to third party vendors and all stuff like that.Facebook did some years ago.So again, it's always good to hear different opinions.We heard from Musk in the last 24 hours, but I do think Apple will find ways to safeguard um their users.Ok. Well, we will see what happens there.Ken Mahoney, Mahoney Asset Management, CEO Thank you so much for joining us.Great.Thank you stocks moving lower this morning as investors a way too big tests for the markets tomorrow.CP I and the fed decision even with fears around higher for longer rates, strategist broad broadly expect big tech to lead stocks higher through year and driven by A I demand.Our next guest is one of those strategist.We have a JP Morgan private bank.You Equities.Ay.Thank you so much for joining us in studio and you know, you have a pretty bullish outlook here, 5500 year end price target for the S and P. You see that going up to 5750 next year.What's driving that?So I think importantly, when we're thinking about the breakdown of returns, right?That's earnings and multiple, when we're thinking about both the 5500 and that 5700, that's all coming from earnings growth and that's between 8 to 10% depending on what calendar year you're looking at.And the majority of that is being driven by tax, right?And what we saw in Q one was this really, you know, just strong across the board quarter in terms of earnings, we saw all 11 sectors beat in Q one, but a lot of that strength was driven by tech and in particular, we saw their margins expand.And so that's very important to us when we're thinking about, you know, 60% of costs are fixed.How do you see that incremental uptick?In terms of earnings growth?We're seeing that from tech in terms of their margin profile.And then on the valuation front, like we actually have valuations contracting a little bit and that's that again is also being driven by tech.And when you think about it from a natural standpoint, yeah, their prices are high and their valuations higher than the, the, the market at the moment, but they're going to grow into that valuation right through their earnings growth where you get.So then you naturally see that valuation compress from, from a large cap tech perspective and that seems like a critical part of why you're able to make the tech sort of rally but also inherent concentration within tech.Part of your book case.When we have a lot of other guests, come on and say that the concentration of the rally in tech is a bearish signal for them.How are you thinking about the differentiation there?Well, so there, there are two things that I would point out one the the earning, the the concentration is being supported by the earnings, right?So you're seeing not only the concentration from a market cap perspective, but you're seeing it from an earnings because they continue to outgrow the rest of the market.Now, you know, coming into the year, we really were thinking that there was going to be this broadening out in terms of the equity market performance into the year end.And we still do believe that, but what you're seeing is the, I mean, that was predicated on the growth rate differentials getting narrower, right?And so what we've seen is we're still seeing that narrow as the rest of the, let's call it 4 93 4 94 catch up to the rest of the mag seven.Um but you're still seeing, but what you're seeing is the tech growth rate is staying elevated, right?So that saw a little bit of an uptick in one Q.So it's still driving the market in mid teens eps growth through the end of the year.But you are starting to see as other sectors come out of their rolling earnings recession, you're seeing their earnings growth also pick up.So a little bit of a broadening out just not to the same magnitude.When do you expect if at all, we're going to see that same magnitude of broadening out and what sectors do you think could benefit from that?So that would be like a second half phenomenon.And I think for us when we're thinking about it, so we're overweight for sectors were overweight, technology, consumer, discretionary, health care and industrials.And I would say at the at the forefront of really coming out of that earnings recession is health care.Health care saw their first negative annual earnings growth period last year.In 2023 there was a lot of COVID digestion going on across different parts of that sector.Um And they're about to flip from negative.So they had a negative one Q or year over year earnings growth rate and that's going to flip positive as we go through the back half of the year.So you pair that with really attractive valuations in the sector.And that to us is a pretty nice set up in terms of health care.I was talking to a source about the health care sector yesterday too who mentioned that their ability to kind of navigate the higher for longer environment is differentiating factor as well and the ability to not have as capital intensive sort of expenditures on the balance sheet.How much of that is a line of thinking and an investment thesis that our investors listening to this should be really looking at in this hire for longer environment.Does that apply to other sectors as well?Yeah, I mean, for health care, yeah, they're not as dependent on the interest rate environment when you're, when you're thinking about large caps, right?Like let's be very clear, small cap biotech is a totally different story.It's riskier, it's much more um I would say exposed to higher interest rates and and will be challenged in that environment.But yes, from, from an overall large cap health care perspective, I mean, it's defensive, it typically again usually has po positive earnings growth and we didn't see that last year.So I think that's a nice differential as well.Um industrials is something that we would think would actually benefit from a higher for longer rate environment, right?When you think about the cyclicality of that, we're seeing PM I is what we think is bottoming and then you've got structural tail winds around things like A I.So that's another sector that we do like, you know, interest rate agnostic as relates to, to industrial and speaking of higher, for longer, we have updated economic projections from the fed tomorrow.If we see less cuts projected by the fed.Is that a risk to the market?What if the fed doesn't cut it all?Yeah, I mean, look, I think the risk is relates to the fed is not necessarily whether or not they cut it all right.Now, we actually only have one cut penciled in at the end of the year.It's really like, what is the next move?And what signal does that send to the market?And I think if the next move were all of a sudden to become a hike, then that is a totally different story when it, when it comes to equities.But as of right now, we are still of the base case that we are going to see inflation gradually come down, which is going to lead to that cut.It just seems like it's going to be later than what was originally anticipated in the beginning of the year.And I think the question is really getting at, ok. What does that mean in terms of valuations?How can we continue to defend these valuations?And I think it's a really and I think this is where like the in the equity risk premium conversation comes in as it relates to equity.So how do equities look relative to bonds?And if you look past in the past 15 years, they look really expensive on an equity risk premium standpoint.But if you extend that out to a period before the the global fund crisis and interest rates weren't zero, the equity risk premium was more compressed similar to how it is today.And so if you're thinking about the risk of inflation remains elevated, but the risk of recession feels relatively low.I think in that tug of war of arguments, I think equities win in terms of in terms of relative to fixed income.Zooming ahead to Friday, Abby when we're, you know, all heading to our Friday evening, happy hour to talk about financial markets as we do.What will you say was the single biggest driver of the week will be the macro news CP I the fed or a lot of the tech headlines that we're getting from Apple, from Tesla and as always in video as well, I think we're in a little bit more of a macro vacuum.Let's call it till we start earning season again back in mid July, right?Like I think a lot of the rally that we saw when the market bottom on April 19th through, you know, um end of May and now was really earnings driven.I think it was fundamentally driven.I think yes, there were definitely some tail winds as it relates to a macro from a macro standpoint, from a softer inflation print that, that the market really needed.But I think right now, it's gonna be more macro driven than, than micro at the moment.Happy Yoder, JP Morgan Private Bank, us Equity strategist.Thank you so much for joining us today.Coming up, a new partnership with Apple is giving shares of a firm a boost.We've got some top training ticket on Yahoo Finance.Next, let's get some trending take that we are watching another day, another more expensive Spotify subscription.The company reportedly introducing a new higher priced premium plan for its users that will charge customers at least $5 more per month for access to tools like better audio and additional tools for creating playlist.This is all according to Bloomberg news reporting.Of course, this is right after the company already announced new price hikes recently here, Ali I know that you covered this name consistently, but I do wanna give a shout out to our producer Cheyenne Reid who pointed out a critical question here.Are we getting low quality audio from Spotify now?And what tools are we missing out on?And I know it sounds kind of silly, but it is an important thing that I think comes with these price hikes from all of these streaming platforms.It's like, well, what is the difference factor between what we're getting now and what you're going to offer us and isn't good enough to warrant the price?Right?And, and I think that's an interesting point too because Spotify has said in the past that they want to introduce different types of tiers.So perhaps a music only tier and audio books only tier.So really allowing more optionality, more flexibility when it comes to the consumer.It sounds like from this Bloomberg report that this is targeting users of Spotify that are consistent, that really want the premium offerings that hi fi audio, the the ability to curate playlists and and it's a specific type of customer, not every customer is going to pay up for that.And I think that's important for all of these companies to start to understand and, and Spotify is one that uh recently has had a pretty strong turn around story.I mean, it wasn't too long ago that the stock was really a difficult place and we've now seen it build back up price hikes, obviously a huge bullish sign from analysts, Wall Street actually thinks that these price hikes from last week that they're going to spread out some other music streamers out there.So perhaps your Amazon, your apples of the world are going to raise prices as well.And if you think about what it costs today, it's it's not, it's pretty cheap, all things considered, you have access to all this music access to all the songs.There's always that big question, the ripple effect there.Is it going to go towards artists?Is it going to go towards the labels?So this is a company that has multiple layers to it and I think at the end of the day, they want to offer as much choice to consumers because there are some out there that are willing to pay up.Yeah.And to your point, last thing on this is just an interesting story of them being defensive and offensive.This is an offensive move to protect their balance sheet.But they've also been having consistent layoffs over the past couple of years and I know that was a pretty a story for them, but it seems like they're really kind of putting an iron wall around their balance sheet right now, which is something investors love to hear, right?They spent 1 billion in podcast.So something's got to give exactly at some point there but more bullish shines here.Now, Shopify is getting a bullish call from JP Morgan, the firm initiating coverage with an overweight rating saying the company's quote competitive moe warrants a premium evaluation you're seeing shop I shares up a little over one there.Now J PM added the company has distinct competitive advantages that will continue to fuel industry leading growth.The bank also sees a margin expansion opportunities as well.If you take a look at a longer term chart, shares have been under pressure so far this year down about 17% over the past three months as well.But J PM saying that creates an attractive entry point for investors.So potentially more upside on the horizon.The bank has a seven $4 price target.So about 20% upside here based on current trading levels.Yeah, it's interesting because this is another name that's been under a lot of pressure recently.Even just last week, we saw Moffett Nathanson cutting Spotify to neutral.So the kind of opposite move as what we're seeing today in terms of the market reaction there, that price target cut coming from off that Nathanson saying that they had previously, you know, had an outperform rating on this name.The stock had risen an average of 63% in the periods rated market perform for M MA.And but now seeing the stock falling to the downside and it points to kind of a broader question about what the long term value at is going to be for Shopify and whether or not the kind of juice has already gotten as much squeeze as possible for some of these e commerce names, particularly as we do start to see a little bit of struggle within the consumer space.What is that going to mean for a company like Shopify?Well, moving on a firm shares are getting a boost today after Apple announcing a firm products will be available to us Apple pay users later this year.A firm saying it doesn't expect the partnership to have a material impact on its revenue in 2025 but it's certainly having a material impact on the stock that stock up nearly 6% it was up over 7% earlier.And this is a big deal for a firm.I mean, this is a company that has been seeking some of these partnerships pretty consistently and to get buy in from a name like Apple, you can't ask for anything more.When you are a company like a firm, you can see that the stock has really been on this sort of ripple effect.I want to take a look at what a firm has been doing year to date.So I'm just going to pull that up here really quickly.Well, it was the largest intraday jump since January that we saw on the heels of that news and you know, having these products available to apple pay users coming out later this year.It's something that you think would be a catalyst for the stock moving forward, especially as you think of the growth of buy.Now pay later, I think back to Black Friday and Cyber Monday.There was a lot of activity around the buy now pay later space and especially as we're in this environment where as you mentioned, consumers are a little bit squeezed.We in this higher for longer interest rate environment.These are companies that could certainly benefit.Absolutely.And just to get that started, this is a name that is down 35% year to date.I'm very curious to see how long it takes them to get to the flat line on your today after this Apple news.Because again, that is the type of news that is exactly what a company like this is going to be looking for and what the street is gonna be looking for as well.Really quickly want to point out another comment from a firm saying that this will enable users checking out online in app with Apple pay on the iphone and ipad to pay over time with a firm.So that could be another leading economic indicator for us as well.Seeing how many users are using the pay over time option.Well, coming up prices on copper, they're moving higher this year.We have seen a recent pull back though.So when is the time to buy into the commodity we're gonna discuss after the break, copper having a record run this year up over 15% year to date due to A I driven demand as well as increased interest in renewable energy.That rally is stalling over the past couple of months.So for more on these moves and what they mean overall for the commodity, we are joined by Adam Turnquist L Financial Chief technical strategist.Thanks so much for joining.It's really great to speak with you.I do want to start just by taking a big step back on copper, right?We know that we are in this higher for longer environment.So we are obsessively looking at every single data point to suss out where we are at in the economy overall.What can copper prices tell us about the macro picture that the day to day economic data might be missing.Hey, good morning.Thanks for having me on.I think when you look back in the longer term trend of copper, we're getting this large breakout from a bottom formation that's been forming.And if you think about copper as a leading economic indicator, just its vast application use.I think it's a pretty good sign overall for global growth.Despite some of that noise that you mentioned in the economic data, of course, what's happening in China is a big contributing factor to to copper prices and overall demand as they try to revive their economy, there are signs of life emerging in the recovery there although a bit slower than I think most expected.But I think there is when you look at the overall supply demand backdrop, it does look constructive on a longer term basis despite this latest pullback that we're seeing off over bot levels.So when do you think we're going to see a rebound in that price action?And what's the ceiling here for you when it comes to copper prices?I think we're close to a potential spot where we'd have an inflection point.The 50 day moving average has been tested.Bulls seem to be stepping up and defending that level.We're trading right near those levels.Potentially, we could see a drawdown maybe to the 2023 highs, right around 4 25 4 30.I think that would be a pretty good entry point if you're looking to get long copper, especially to play this energy transition.You think about demand, outpacing supply longer term, it takes a long time to get copper out of the ground.And we, you forecast some of the, the whether it's EVs or just the, the net zero emissions, there's not enough copper to meet the demand in the current state.So I think longer term copper moves higher and could easily go back and retest these recent highs in pretty short order, speculators have been piling into this.This looks more like profit taking off over bot levels than anything else right now.Well, Adam, another key driver of demand is of course artificial intelligence and the impact that that has in terms of needs for data centers.The electricity grid is also key here.We have a lot of guests come on and talk about the importance of finding the pick and shovel investment opportunities when it comes to A I is copper as pick and shovel as you can possibly get if you're trying to play the A I trade, I think it's a pretty good one.I don't know if it's as close as you can get with some of the other pick and shovel moves at the company level, but I think it's a pretty good play in terms of that energy transition, that's, that goes beyond just A I.And of course A I is a, a huge tailwind for copper.When you think about the electric and the power grid, all of those are coming under massive changes over the next several years, industrials would be another spot as an A I play.If you think about data centers, the manufacturing, the maintenance, that's another sector that we like as well more at the equity level.So you mentioned is that overall energy transition, what are some other catalysts behind what's fueling the demand here for copper?Because I don't think investors realize that copper is behind a lot of different things that we use every day in our lives.Yeah, outside of electric vehicles, which of course take way more copper.If you just look at the construction industry, that's the biggest um in terms of demand for copper that's doing quite well as we're building out infrastructure.Of course, that's, that's been a big key move here that, that we like as well.When you think about just the resorting theme and utilities are another one that obviously um it would be another spot for, for the A I play in, in terms of uh the energy transition here.I'm not going to ask you to talk about a specific company, but hypothetically, let's say you've got the world's biggest phone maker saying that they are going to utilize A I how much does a CFO of that company need to be worrying about the price of copper and the impact that could have as a potential head went on their balance sheet.I don't think it's gonna be a major headwind when you think about the consumer, the elasticity of demand with, with smartphones right now.Of course, it doesn't, the price points have not been a major factor.You can see that over the years as they've continued to increase.When you're talking about $2000 phones with demand, it, it hasn't been a big factor, but at the margin level, of course, as input prices go up, that could be a factor that could impact overall earnings.And I want to go back to China because you did point out that the supply side there is a bit mixed.Why is that not a concern for you in the long run?Well, we're watching the supply side there overall because right now it's at record levels.Typically you see copper supplies in China elevate to really the 1st, 1st quarter of a part of the year and then they start to dwindle as factory activity increases.We're not seeing that quite yet.But when you look at the futures curve of copper and this is why we're a little bit, um we're, we're discounting that a little bit is because we're in backwardation, meaning front month or spot prices are trading above second or third month contracts that suggests there's a tight copper market on a near term basis and supporting that I think bid into copper that we're seeing.Yeah, Adam and closing out the China's uh impact in terms of commodities.We are seeing muted demand coming from Chinese fabricators as well.So along with some of that profit taking, that could be a little bit of a temporary headwind for this commodity.Adam thanks so much for joining us.That was Adam Turnquist.He is LP L Financials, chief technical strategist on all things copper.Now, looking ahead to the 2024 election, we've got a new note out of JP Morgan saying market consensus is for Trump to win the White House.But overall investors are not that concerned about the election, at least right now, only 12% of J PM survey respondents see the upcoming election as the biggest threat to the market rally.Let's bring in Rick Newman for more.Rick.I immediately sat up when I saw this news because we've all been talking about what the market is pricing in ahead of this election.How big of a deal does this seem to you?I think this uh market consensus is premature.Uh This race is basically a toss up and it's very possible that what whatever is going to turn the outcome, either to Trump or Biden, assume both of them make it to the finish line.It's possible that that thing hasn't even happened yet.Uh I mean, I think we've got uh more uh black Swan Risk than you normally would have an election given number one the age of these two candidates.Uh and everything that's going on with Donald Trump.Uh We're gonna have two debates.Uh The debates can be decisive, things can happen during those debates.Uh And let's just, let's not forget Trump is now a convicted felon and there's gonna be a sentencing uh in July when he, he may actually get sentenced to jail time.Um So I, I think it, it would be a big mistake to assume that Trump has this in the bag.We still have almost five months to go until election day and there's just a ton that can happen between now and then, Rick, you mentioned that first debate coming up at the end of this month.What do you think is going to drive the conversation points in that debate?Is it the economy, is it geopolitical risks or is it something else?Well, I have to, I have to believe the moderators are going to raise the issue of, uh Donald Trump's conviction in the New York Court a couple of weeks ago on 34 felony counts.Um I don't, I don't know that Biden himself has to say too much about that.But I think, uh I, I mean, I'd, I'd be astonished if that is not, you know, a huge focus of ads and billboards and swing state commercials, uh, you know, during the last two or three months of the election, um, I, I guess the, um, the moderators will ask about issues.I mean, there are a lot of issues at stake here, especially for investors.I mean, the big one is, uh, is these tax cuts, the 2017 tax cuts that expire at the end of 2025.So the next president is going to have a major role in that.There's talk of either raising the corporate tax rate if you're Joe Biden, if President Biden gets a second term or lowering the corporate tax rate.If Donald Trump wins a second term, there are the tariffs on China that Trump wants to impose and a lot of other factors for investors.Uh I, I mean, it's, I think it's just still too early for investors to be uh basically betting on the outcome of the election.But I think that's gonna change in, uh in September and October.I think we're gonna get a lot more intense focus on the polls in the six or seven swing states.You might start to see the market go up or down based on what some polls show is because there are a lot of uh issues that uh the next president is going to have to determine that will affect markets.All right, Rick a lot to keep track of.I know you'll be watching it for all of us.Thank you.So much.Bye guys.Coming up.The NBA finals are in full swing and so are their media rights contract negotiations.We hear an NBA deputy Commissioner Mark Tatum has to say next inflation and a strong job market has sent jitters the markets over the past few months as investors brace for the possibility that rates could be higher for longer.But one investment vehicle has been seeing some benefits from the high rate environment, municipal bonds and joining us now and stand close head of municipal d. Thank you so much for joining us.Now, there is this expectation that the fed could begin to cut rates later this year.Given that is now the appropriate time to put some money to work in Munis.Sure.And, and thank you so much for having me, Ali.I do appreciate it.Uh We certainly think so.I mean, if you look at what's happened to Muni's so far this year, there's been two broad themes.One is treasury rates on 10 year treasuries has gone up 50 basis points.So that's affected everything in fixed income, including Munis and 50 basis points cheaper than we started the year.Uh And the second thing that's really impacted Muni and why we think it's such great value right now is the supply of Muni.We've seen supply go up of municipals through the end of May up 40%.And with that, we've had two back to back months, the months of April and May where we saw more than 40 billion of supply.I think what that really does is it sets us up really well for the second half of the year, the second half of the year.I don't think we're gonna see as much issuance.We're hearing from underwriters.We're hearing from Issuers bankers that they're bringing deals forward that normally would happen in the fourth quarter so that they avoid the election and they avoid all the issues that happen in the 2016 election.So I think we'll have less issuance.And I think we're also gonna have a very, very good technical the next two months where you're gonna have $80 billion in coupons in maturing bonds in all these different proceeds that recycle back to the Muni market very quickly.And those are both very, very good technical backstops.And, and I think as well as we were discussing right before, you know, six and a quarter percent for a Aa intermediate Muni strategy, I think is very attractive and, and nine and a quarter percent for a high yield I think is just a number which is going to go in and draw investors off the sideline.Yeah, I mean, those are significant yields particularly when we're used to talking about things like treasury corporate bonds.The returns are just not as high.I am curious in terms of risks for those returns.How closely are you and municipal bond holders supposed to be watching the macro data and any potential softness we might be seeing in that data and what read through.Could that have to mu needs?Yes.Sure.And we have 23 credit analysts at Naveen where all they're doing is looking at the broader macro and, and I think as we, I take a step back and look at it, we don't usually see a high correlation between the economy and defaults in municipals.Uh by that.I mean, you know, your water and sewer bill, you're not gonna go in and fail to pay your water and sewer bill no matter the economy.It's a really inelastic demand curve for most of what these have.These are essential service, monopolies, somewhat recession proof, somewhat recession proof and almost everything we see, we just don't see a large correlation between defaults in Munis and where they were and where the economy is.Yes.And, and given that, you know, the Munis base very fragmented.What sectors or areas are you most bullish on right now?Yes.So more than 50,000 different issuers in the town I live in, I'm just north of Chicago.There's nine issuers alone in that town.So it is a very fragmented market.On the high grade side.We're really looking at local general obligation bonds.These are uh bonds that are repaid by property taxes.We think with the housing market continuing to do.Well, that's a very good place to be and they're offering very good yields.On the high yield side, we're really favoring land secure deals.These are deals that uh are financed by build outs in states like Florida for potable water, for streetscapes and that are ultimately repaid by property taxes uh and, and different assessments.So we're very bullish on those two.We think those are gonna do very well uh recession or now here over the next uh couple of years, I do want to bring this a little bit closer to home here in New York City because Governor Kathy Hole did move to kill congestion pricing policy.And now some are calling on MT A Muni bond holders to fight back against that move.I want to pull up a post from the director of a nonprofit focusing on public enterprise saying that I'm calling on anyone who purchased MT A Muni Bonds to come forward and bring the lot to bear on the state of New York.I'm not gonna ask you about congestion pricing.We're not gonna get into that tit for tat here.But I am just curious generally, how much power historically do many bond holders have over public policy?And is this a way for investors, retail investors listening to this segment now to who are invested in local politics to maybe have another avenue of influence is not the word I'm looking for but influence.Yeah.Well, and it's interesting to see that, that congestion pricing would have been uh we think very favorable for mini bonds.You go in and you take a billion dollars in what we expected the revenue to be.You could leverage it up to 15 billion by issuing debt.That really helps out the capital structure.You know, if you go in and you have fewer cars on the street because of the congestion pricing, then you also go in and support the, the fair backs bonds.You know, owning mini bonds.There's, you don't have uh unlike on the equity side where you could go in and you could vote for directors and you could vote for different uh governance issues.We really don't have that as much as large holders uh in the MT A, we certainly do have influence but it's something traditionally asset managers, at least on the municipal bond side have really exercised to too much.We uh we have 100 and 25 year history at Naveen of providing tax exempt income.Part of that is also knowing that uh sometimes local matters and local affairs uh not weighing in on this much.Well, really quickly here, I know that you had a take for us on airports and uni bonds and obviously huge travel demand coming up this summer.What read through does that have to airport bonds?So airport bonds have done very well this year.Uh We've seen about 3.5 billion of issuances.So Midway sfo had an issuance.Um We've, we've seen issuances come through and anticipate about 20 billion or so of issuance uh for the balance of the year.So II I think it's been interesting airport credit has done really well.You think of airports that lost 80% of their top line revenue and yet we have more upgrades and downgrades and 25% of them are better rated than where they were before the pandemic.So in airports, we expect uh more issuance and a lot of this issuance is not being driven by runways, it's not being driven by gates, it's being driven by the passenger experience lounges and rest restaurants and shopping.And so it's more of an experience rather than uh that we're financing rather than the traditional brick and mortar.So we do anticipate more airport issuance for the balance of the year, fully 20 billion for 2024 and 100 and 50 billion by the end of 27.Really interesting, Dan, it's always great to speak with you because you have an ability to bring Muni bonds into the reality for folks.So really appreciate it.Thank you for coming in studio.Thanks so much for having me.Well, that is Dan Close.He is Nave's head of municipals.Now, the NBA finals are in full swing with game three between the Celtics and Mavericks kicking off tomorrow night in Dallas while the games are still taking place on the court.A little game for the NBA executives deep in negotiations for their next media rights deal.All I know you had the opportunity to sit down with NBA deputy Commissioner Mark Tatum yesterday.What is sticking out to you from his comments about just the kind of back and forth of this deal?Yeah, so he declined to comment on the specifics of the actual negotiations, but he did talk about how fragmented the sports media rights landscape is right now and how as any type of league once in this day and age, not just the NBA, but also the NFL and HLM will be, you want to be as diversified as possible with your media partner.So we have a quick sound by that.I want to play where he talks about that a little bit more.So over the last 5 to 10 years, sports consumption has been defined by an increase in optionality for the fan and ultra personalization.And so there are more ways than ever to watch sports programming NBA content.And what we're trying to do is make sure that no matter where the fan is that we're meeting them where they are, that we're customizing what they're seeing, the teams are seeing the players are interested in based on their preferences.And so uh there's still very much a role for traditional television.We very much like the fact that our uh finals are on traditional network television.Um but we also understand that a new generation of fans are consuming content through streaming platforms.And so we wanna make sure uh that we have that availability of programming and content across all different channels.So I, I think what you're gonna see is more of a hybrid, having our games both on traditional television and streaming in an effort to reach all of our fans.So a hybrid approach there and if you think about the latest reporting around these media rights negotiations, that's exactly what's going to happen right now.NBC Universal ESPN that they're in the league for linear.But also we have ESPN plus is that over the top streaming package, Amazon also in talks for an streaming exclusive package as well and these are, this is a big amounts of money that a lot of these networks are willing to cough up.I mean, Amazon's 1.8 billion NBC Universal reported 2.5 billion notice, noticeably missing here is Warner Brothers Discoveries, TNT which has, you know, had this the rights to this league for so long, but they're just not coughing up the cash that these leagues want.And it seems like TNT sort of missed the boat by sloughing off the importance of this deal early on is my interpretation at least and, and, and also more about discovery is going through a transition period.Their balance sheet is all over the place and some analysts have said, look, it might not make sense for them to pay this much for the NBA while there are others that are like, no, this is very important that they have the NBA moving forward.So we'll see ultimately what happens.These negotiations are still ongoing and long term, whether or not this is an overall headwind for viewership because the viewers are concerned about and questioning just where they need to.It's complicated.They're just gonna end up going to the local restaurant.At least that's what they're gonna be going to the bar to watch because it's the only way they can find the true ability to guarantee they're gonna be able to watch a great interview.Thanks so much for bringing that to us.We're gonna have all of your markets action ahead right here.So stay tuned for more.You're watching Catalysts.We've been discussing Apple's latest event all morning and the reaction seems mixed.D A Davidson upgraded Apple and raised its price target.On the back of the announcement, we had a chance to speak to the analyst behind that call, Gloria earlier today.Here's what he had to say.A lot of noise, a lot of people with different expectations coming in.But if you look at the signal away from the noise, you realize that this is unprecedented capabilities that Apple is gonna introduce and it's going to integrate A I into everyday life.Meanwhile, Apple shareholder Ken Mahoney was a bit more muted in his reaction and predicted we may see a slight short term downturn this summer.Take a listen.Look, we're in this mix here.I've been telling investors we could hit a low with Apple over the summer time as why would you want to upgrade your, you know, your phone here?Why not wait for the 15 or the 16 and so forth?So we could hit a little low.Interesting to see the varying reactions that we've had across Wall Street, across shareholders.But if you take a look at the share price right now, we are up more than 5% surpassing an intra day high market cap at around 3.2 trillion.So at least right now it seems like investors are digesting all of the announcements that we did get.And with the positive where as last night, we saw the stock of around 2% and this is so important apples hitting new all time highs today.And this is critical because this is a stock that just flipped in a positive year to date territory in a matter of the last couple of weeks.You can see on that chart here just happening in the month of June.Apple, finally flipping in a positive year to date territory.That was a huge issue for one of the big tech names, not just for Apple, of course, but for the broader market to have this much pressure on a $3 trillion company as of today because of the market moves to the upside that we're seeing this stock up 9.5 percent year to date.So really a big turnaround story that is exactly what Apple was hoping to do.And at least when you look at the stock price, they did deliver, it's interesting to see that the market reaction was negative after getting the news from the developers conference yesterday.So perhaps after seeing some of the consumer commentary off of that, also hearing some and seeing in some of the notes this morning that it was a little bit of a buy the rumor, sell the news.The kind of optimism around the stock was a little bit priced in but looks like there's a lot more optimism to go for this stock.We didn't even talk about the Gen Moji announcement, how you can generate your own emoji just but I mean the millennial in me is very excited about this.The calculator on the ipad.There's a lot of features outside of A I was as well.Are you excited for the React too?I'm such a react girl.The fact that I can be creative with my message reacts.I like, yeah, I wanna have some fun.Let's let, let's let's get that.I'm only already anticipating the Gen Moji.My friends are going to be sending back and forth in our group chat.So I love it all and I the key millennial sources, we will be driving the new trends and Apple replies.Absolutely.It comes to emojis.All right, everyone will.Coming up here, we're gonna have wealth.It's dedicated to all of your personal finance needs.Our very own Brad Smith has for the next hour.Stay t for more.",

written by angel smithvideo transcriptit s 10 a m  here in new york city i m madison mills alongside alexandra can now we re going to dive into the catalyst moving markets today apple joins in on the a i hype announcing new features and a partnership with open a i that could bring generative a i directly to customers is this enough to boost lagging iphone sales will discuss and tesla shareholders expected to vote on ceo elon musk   56 billion pay package on thursday we discuss what this means for the company s future and outside of big tech market face another big test on wednesday with cp i and the f decision in focus will track how the data move markets but first we have to talk about today is a big story apples a i announcements  the new features called apple intelligence will only be available on a limited number of devices including the iphone 15 and upcoming 16 this comes as iphone sales have been under pressure in racing quarters is this enough to offer a boost we spoke to gd a davidson managing director about how a i changes apple s position among its competitors here s what he had to say we think it took the lead because again  everybody else has to try to fit their solutions elsewhere or it really doesn t have access to the consumer and the consumer information apple has our information  right so this speaks to the tagline that apple used  right a i for the rest of us  a bit of an homage to the 19 eighties when they had the mac book out a computer for the rest of us and really the personalization of apple and how they have access to the customer data and they really want to double down on making sure that all these a i features are for the benefit of the consumers story continuesso that means if you have a meeting coming up  apple can say  hey  you re going to late to this if you don t do xyz so a little  a little creepy  but you know  they also said that they want to protect people s privacy as much as possible that is not going to train open a i models so we ll see once that goes into practice and this is adopted more if that becomes an issue well  it s such a great point and this is the key sort of catalyst for apple moving forward are they going to be able to continue to keep consumer privacy in mind which has been a key really success point for them in the past  the ability to prioritize consumer privacy they do say that every time you re going to be utilizing a track g bt powered function on the iphone you re going to get prompted with a request of whether or not that s ok  but that will inevitably send your data over to open a i so i think a big question moving forward will be consumer comfort with open a i versus apple those are two different functions there in the degree to which consumers even know about that will also be another question does look like apple is moving to the upside here so interesting to see investors maybe being a little bit more positive today  coming back off of those lows yesterday and continuing this conversation around apple  we initially saw muted response from investors after those announcements  we were talking about shares moving to the upside over 3  here today we have one of those investors here with us we ve got apple shareholder and ceo of mahoney asset management it s great to speak with you i know that you did not change your positioning after the news over the past 24 hours here from apple but you know a really interesting point about the impact of the announcements that we ve been hearing from apple here i m curious what was missing from the announcement that would have made you a little bit more enthusiastic because in reading your note  i feel like i can shot summarize it as just a big shrug to the news well  again  i i think long term  it s great you have this huge buyback in place 100 and  10 billion buy back there a couple of shekels here  you have a huge upgrade cycle that s gonna come out of this i mean  there s 270 million phones out there that are 55 years or older  that s a big opportunity but as far as the technology again  ii i just on a lot of other technology research  you know  they thought yawn  they spend a lot of time on sur which i like siri hope sir does a little bit more like like siri on steroids with this new uh a i model and so forth but i don t really see it as a  as a yawn as more just like this is apple you know  they have 2 2 billion devices out there last year  they had 2 billion devices tim cook did a great job kind of pivoting our focus from hardware sales to really services and this is really where this it s gonna blossom so it s not so much a yawn as it is this is what s expected you have this many uh customers  you know  tweak here  tweak there  join the  join the party and i think they  they ll succeed does it have explosive upside like nvidia no explosive upside by other areas in  in a i not necessarily  but there s a pretty good apple put when you have 100 and  10 billion a share buyback underneath you so where  what more do you want to see when it comes to apple where do you think that upside lies and we should mention that the stock is now hitting an intra day high as investors are starting to digest some of those new features so it seems like even though it might have been a bit of a  i don t know what this means moving forward yesterday today  we re seeing that chair reaction in the positive so for you  what do you want more of here so what i would like to see more of is is better integration from the mac to the ipad to the iphone you re starting to see that but to really worth that and really siri being the head  you know  kind of the head person there putting all those things together  as you mentioned  scheduling appointments  reminded of appointments  there s one app on that so it was kind of cool like if you re supposed to pick someone up on an air plane uh at  at the airport  it tells you kind of oh the airport  you know  you should be leaving soon  you should be leaving in 10 minutes if you want to meet  meet that person so there s gonna be a lot of applications  i guess it s just kind of overwhelming the amount of  of applications uh a i that could go about again  the biggest thing is they have all these customers and they want apple to take the lead and i m not sure necessarily  apple is taking a total  uh  leap of faith into this i think they re kinda ok  we ll do it  but we ll put it on top of a i  we ll put it on top of surrey as opposed to kind of blazing a new trail well  one question i have is who s going to foot the bill for everything that you just described ken apple saying they re not gonna pass off the cost for chat g bt to customers does that mean apple takes on those costs and to what extent is that a headwind for their profit margins right but th this is a monetization area that they haven t had before so  you know  even it s a small piece of the pie because it s percentage breakouts with developers and so forth i mean  it s kind of complex how they re gonna do it  but in the end  they re in the driver s seat and that these companies have to come to apple if they want to play so i think it s still gonna be a pay to play model much like that is on the app store as we see it so you re saying that the ability to charge customers for utilizing specific a i features is going to outpace the cost of those features for apple i i believe so  i believe so  look  they have a lot of different avenues they could take this with um but i  i think that s probably the best way to monetize the site to be able to have happy customers and to entice others to this upgrade cycle look  we re in this mix here i ve been telling investors we could hit a low with apple over the summer time as why would you want to upgrade your  you know  your phone here why not wait for the 15 or the 16 and so forth so we could hit a little low um but then again  once  once you see that a cool feature and you see it on instagram or your friends using it  you know  they re the early adapters usually to the stuff of technology and then behind are people like me say  00  you can do this  you can do that and so that is where apple is gonna be able to monetize the site more there s new features and new ways and new apps all around a i and ken  we spoke with gil laia from d a davidson earlier this morning he said that when it comes to the competitive landscape in a i that apple is in the lead do you agree with that huh i m not so i would say nvidia is in the lead i mean  this is pretty much drawn up by the ceo of nvidia who said by the way  when a second or third inning of this cycle  i m not sure apple is in lead  but they don t have to be in the lead you know  they re the big  they have 2 2 billion devices out there so it s  it s  you know  developers and all them could come to apple  but i don t think necessarily they re taking the lead i would say nvidia um kind of in the round of that  you know   3 trillion market cap and you know  just added on a trillion in the last six weeks kind of shows that the video is probably the leader in the space  not apple  but still apple doesn t have to necessarily be the leader in the space because they have all these customers uh obviously  and and the ecosystem as you know  once you re in an iphone  typically you re gonna stay there you don t want to do your photos  don t lose your contacts it integrates with your mac  integrates with your ipad so they create this great ecosystem and they could just add services on top of that with the base that they have i think it s still a win  win for shareholders i wanna talk about one other risk for apple and that is elon musk he posted on x yesterday saying that if apple integrates open a i at the os level  then apple devices would be banned at his company and he s calling it an unacceptable security violation how big of a risk is that for you and your asset holdings here right so it s just still trying to figure that out and again  we have to take elon musk word  i mean  he s a very smart individual and he s always kind of looking ahead where things are but again  um i  i would think there s an opt in uh you opt into this uh a i platform or a i chat et whatever and it tells you here s disclaimers so it s really up to the consumer to decide if they want to go in so i don t think apple is just gonna just take your data  data and feed it over there i think they re gonna have a few speed bumps that i think consumers will be happy with remember  apple has always been high integrity about  about collecting data they have all this data they re not selling to third party vendors and all stuff like that facebook did some years ago so again  it s always good to hear different opinions we heard from musk in the last 24 hours  but i do think apple will find ways to safeguard um their users ok  well  we will see what happens there ken mahoney  mahoney asset management  ceo thank you so much for joining us great thank you stocks moving lower this morning as investors a way too big tests for the markets tomorrow cp i and the fed decision even with fears around higher for longer rates  strategist broad broadly expect big tech to lead stocks higher through year and driven by a i demand our next guest is one of those strategist we have a jp morgan private bank you equities ay thank you so much for joining us in studio and you know  you have a pretty bullish outlook here  5500 year end price target for the s and p  you see that going up to 5750 next year what s driving that so i think importantly  when we re thinking about the breakdown of returns  right that s earnings and multiple  when we re thinking about both the 5500 and that 5700  that s all coming from earnings growth and that s between 8 to 10  depending on what calendar year you re looking at and the majority of that is being driven by tax  right and what we saw in q one was this really  you know  just strong across the board quarter in terms of earnings  we saw all 11 sectors beat in q one  but a lot of that strength was driven by tech and in particular  we saw their margins expand and so that s very important to us when we re thinking about  you know  60  of costs are fixed how do you see that incremental uptick in terms of earnings growth we re seeing that from tech in terms of their margin profile and then on the valuation front  like we actually have valuations contracting a little bit and that s that again is also being driven by tech and when you think about it from a natural standpoint  yeah  their prices are high and their valuations higher than the  the  the market at the moment  but they re going to grow into that valuation right through their earnings growth where you get so then you naturally see that valuation compress from  from a large cap tech perspective and that seems like a critical part of why you re able to make the tech sort of rally but also inherent concentration within tech part of your book case when we have a lot of other guests  come on and say that the concentration of the rally in tech is a bearish signal for them how are you thinking about the differentiation there well  so there  there are two things that i would point out one the the earning  the the concentration is being supported by the earnings  right so you re seeing not only the concentration from a market cap perspective  but you re seeing it from an earnings because they continue to outgrow the rest of the market now  you know  coming into the year  we really were thinking that there was going to be this broadening out in terms of the equity market performance into the year end and we still do believe that  but what you re seeing is the  i mean  that was predicated on the growth rate differentials getting narrower  right and so what we ve seen is we re still seeing that narrow as the rest of the  let s call it 4 93 4 94 catch up to the rest of the mag seven um but you re still seeing  but what you re seeing is the tech growth rate is staying elevated  right so that saw a little bit of an uptick in one q so it s still driving the market in mid teens eps growth through the end of the year but you are starting to see as other sectors come out of their rolling earnings recession  you re seeing their earnings growth also pick up so a little bit of a broadening out just not to the same magnitude when do you expect if at all  we re going to see that same magnitude of broadening out and what sectors do you think could benefit from that so that would be like a second half phenomenon and i think for us when we re thinking about it  so we re overweight for sectors were overweight  technology  consumer  discretionary  health care and industrials and i would say at the at the forefront of really coming out of that earnings recession is health care health care saw their first negative annual earnings growth period last year in 2023 there was a lot of covid digestion going on across different parts of that sector um and they re about to flip from negative so they had a negative one q or year over year earnings growth rate and that s going to flip positive as we go through the back half of the year so you pair that with really attractive valuations in the sector and that to us is a pretty nice set up in terms of health care i was talking to a source about the health care sector yesterday too who mentioned that their ability to kind of navigate the higher for longer environment is differentiating factor as well and the ability to not have as capital intensive sort of expenditures on the balance sheet how much of that is a line of thinking and an investment thesis that our investors listening to this should be really looking at in this hire for longer environment does that apply to other sectors as well yeah  i mean  for health care  yeah  they re not as dependent on the interest rate environment when you re  when you re thinking about large caps  right like let s be very clear  small cap biotech is a totally different story it s riskier  it s much more um i would say exposed to higher interest rates and and will be challenged in that environment but yes  from  from an overall large cap health care perspective  i mean  it s defensive  it typically again usually has po positive earnings growth and we didn t see that last year so i think that s a nice differential as well um industrials is something that we would think would actually benefit from a higher for longer rate environment  right when you think about the cyclicality of that  we re seeing pm i is what we think is bottoming and then you ve got structural tail winds around things like a i so that s another sector that we do like  you know  interest rate agnostic as relates to  to industrial and speaking of higher  for longer  we have updated economic projections from the fed tomorrow if we see less cuts projected by the fed is that a risk to the market what if the fed doesn t cut it all yeah  i mean  look  i think the risk is relates to the fed is not necessarily whether or not they cut it all right now  we actually only have one cut penciled in at the end of the year it s really like  what is the next move and what signal does that send to the market and i think if the next move were all of a sudden to become a hike  then that is a totally different story when it  when it comes to equities but as of right now  we are still of the base case that we are going to see inflation gradually come down  which is going to lead to that cut it just seems like it s going to be later than what was originally anticipated in the beginning of the year and i think the question is really getting at  ok  what does that mean in terms of valuations how can we continue to defend these valuations and i think it s a really and i think this is where like the in the equity risk premium conversation comes in as it relates to equity so how do equities look relative to bonds and if you look past in the past 15 years  they look really expensive on an equity risk premium standpoint but if you extend that out to a period before the the global fund crisis and interest rates weren t zero  the equity risk premium was more compressed similar to how it is today and so if you re thinking about the risk of inflation remains elevated  but the risk of recession feels relatively low i think in that tug of war of arguments  i think equities win in terms of in terms of relative to fixed income zooming ahead to friday  abby when we re  you know  all heading to our friday evening  happy hour to talk about financial markets as we do what will you say was the single biggest driver of the week will be the macro news cp i the fed or a lot of the tech headlines that we re getting from apple  from tesla and as always in video as well  i think we re in a little bit more of a macro vacuum let s call it till we start earning season again back in mid july  right like i think a lot of the rally that we saw when the market bottom on april 19th through  you know  um end of may and now was really earnings driven i think it was fundamentally driven i think yes  there were definitely some tail winds as it relates to a macro from a macro standpoint  from a softer inflation print that  that the market really needed but i think right now  it s gonna be more macro driven than  than micro at the moment happy yoder  jp morgan private bank  us equity strategist thank you so much for joining us today coming up  a new partnership with apple is giving shares of a firm a boost we ve got some top training ticket on yahoo finance next  let s get some trending take that we are watching another day  another more expensive spotify subscription the company reportedly introducing a new higher priced premium plan for its users that will charge customers at least  5 more per month for access to tools like better audio and additional tools for creating playlist this is all according to bloomberg news reporting of course  this is right after the company already announced new price hikes recently here  ali i know that you covered this name consistently  but i do wanna give a shout out to our producer cheyenne reid who pointed out a critical question here are we getting low quality audio from spotify now and what tools are we missing out on and i know it sounds kind of silly  but it is an important thing that i think comes with these price hikes from all of these streaming platforms it s like  well  what is the difference factor between what we re getting now and what you re going to offer us and isn t good enough to warrant the price right and  and i think that s an interesting point too because spotify has said in the past that they want to introduce different types of tiers so perhaps a music only tier and audio books only tier so really allowing more optionality  more flexibility when it comes to the consumer it sounds like from this bloomberg report that this is targeting users of spotify that are consistent  that really want the premium offerings that hi fi audio  the the ability to curate playlists and and it s a specific type of customer  not every customer is going to pay up for that and i think that s important for all of these companies to start to understand and  and spotify is one that uh recently has had a pretty strong turn around story i mean  it wasn t too long ago that the stock was really a difficult place and we ve now seen it build back up price hikes  obviously a huge bullish sign from analysts  wall street actually thinks that these price hikes from last week that they re going to spread out some other music streamers out there so perhaps your amazon  your apples of the world are going to raise prices as well and if you think about what it costs today  it s it s not  it s pretty cheap  all things considered  you have access to all this music access to all the songs there s always that big question  the ripple effect there is it going to go towards artists is it going to go towards the labels so this is a company that has multiple layers to it and i think at the end of the day  they want to offer as much choice to consumers because there are some out there that are willing to pay up yeah and to your point  last thing on this is just an interesting story of them being defensive and offensive this is an offensive move to protect their balance sheet but they ve also been having consistent layoffs over the past couple of years and i know that was a pretty a story for them  but it seems like they re really kind of putting an iron wall around their balance sheet right now  which is something investors love to hear  right they spent 1 billion in podcast so something s got to give exactly at some point there but more bullish shines here now  shopify is getting a bullish call from jp morgan  the firm initiating coverage with an overweight rating saying the company s quote competitive moe warrants a premium evaluation you re seeing shop i shares up a little over one there now j pm added the company has distinct competitive advantages that will continue to fuel industry leading growth the bank also sees a margin expansion opportunities as well if you take a look at a longer term chart  shares have been under pressure so far this year down about 17  over the past three months as well but j pm saying that creates an attractive entry point for investors so potentially more upside on the horizon the bank has a seven  4 price target so about 20  upside here based on current trading levels yeah  it s interesting because this is another name that s been under a lot of pressure recently even just last week  we saw moffett nathanson cutting spotify to neutral so the kind of opposite move as what we re seeing today in terms of the market reaction there  that price target cut coming from off that nathanson saying that they had previously  you know  had an outperform rating on this name the stock had risen an average of 63  in the periods rated market perform for m ma and but now seeing the stock falling to the downside and it points to kind of a broader question about what the long term value at is going to be for shopify and whether or not the kind of juice has already gotten as much squeeze as possible for some of these e commerce names  particularly as we do start to see a little bit of struggle within the consumer space what is that going to mean for a company like shopify well  moving on a firm shares are getting a boost today after apple announcing a firm products will be available to us apple pay users later this year a firm saying it doesn t expect the partnership to have a material impact on its revenue in 2025 but it s certainly having a material impact on the stock that stock up nearly 6  it was up over 7  earlier and this is a big deal for a firm i mean  this is a company that has been seeking some of these partnerships pretty consistently and to get buy in from a name like apple  you can t ask for anything more when you are a company like a firm  you can see that the stock has really been on this sort of ripple effect i want to take a look at what a firm has been doing year to date so i m just going to pull that up here really quickly well  it was the largest intraday jump since january that we saw on the heels of that news and you know  having these products available to apple pay users coming out later this year it s something that you think would be a catalyst for the stock moving forward  especially as you think of the growth of buy now pay later  i think back to black friday and cyber monday there was a lot of activity around the buy now pay later space and especially as we re in this environment where as you mentioned  consumers are a little bit squeezed we in this higher for longer interest rate environment these are companies that could certainly benefit absolutely and just to get that started  this is a name that is down 35  year to date i m very curious to see how long it takes them to get to the flat line on your today after this apple news because again  that is the type of news that is exactly what a company like this is going to be looking for and what the street is gonna be looking for as well really quickly want to point out another comment from a firm saying that this will enable users checking out online in app with apple pay on the iphone and ipad to pay over time with a firm so that could be another leading economic indicator for us as well seeing how many users are using the pay over time option well  coming up prices on copper  they re moving higher this year we have seen a recent pull back though so when is the time to buy into the commodity we re gonna discuss after the break  copper having a record run this year up over 15  year to date due to a i driven demand as well as increased interest in renewable energy that rally is stalling over the past couple of months so for more on these moves and what they mean overall for the commodity  we are joined by adam turnquist l financial chief technical strategist thanks so much for joining it s really great to speak with you i do want to start just by taking a big step back on copper  right we know that we are in this higher for longer environment so we are obsessively looking at every single data point to suss out where we are at in the economy overall what can copper prices tell us about the macro picture that the day to day economic data might be missing hey  good morning thanks for having me on i think when you look back in the longer term trend of copper  we re getting this large breakout from a bottom formation that s been forming and if you think about copper as a leading economic indicator  just its vast application use i think it s a pretty good sign overall for global growth despite some of that noise that you mentioned in the economic data  of course  what s happening in china is a big contributing factor to to copper prices and overall demand as they try to revive their economy  there are signs of life emerging in the recovery there although a bit slower than i think most expected but i think there is when you look at the overall supply demand backdrop  it does look constructive on a longer term basis despite this latest pullback that we re seeing off over bot levels so when do you think we re going to see a rebound in that price action and what s the ceiling here for you when it comes to copper prices i think we re close to a potential spot where we d have an inflection point the 50 day moving average has been tested bulls seem to be stepping up and defending that level we re trading right near those levels potentially  we could see a drawdown maybe to the 2023 highs  right around 4 25 4 30 i think that would be a pretty good entry point if you re looking to get long copper  especially to play this energy transition you think about demand  outpacing supply longer term  it takes a long time to get copper out of the ground and we  you forecast some of the  the whether it s evs or just the  the net zero emissions  there s not enough copper to meet the demand in the current state so i think longer term copper moves higher and could easily go back and retest these recent highs in pretty short order  speculators have been piling into this this looks more like profit taking off over bot levels than anything else right now well  adam  another key driver of demand is of course artificial intelligence and the impact that that has in terms of needs for data centers the electricity grid is also key here we have a lot of guests come on and talk about the importance of finding the pick and shovel investment opportunities when it comes to a i is copper as pick and shovel as you can possibly get if you re trying to play the a i trade  i think it s a pretty good one i don t know if it s as close as you can get with some of the other pick and shovel moves at the company level  but i think it s a pretty good play in terms of that energy transition  that s  that goes beyond just a i and of course a i is a  a huge tailwind for copper when you think about the electric and the power grid  all of those are coming under massive changes over the next several years  industrials would be another spot as an a i play if you think about data centers  the manufacturing  the maintenance  that s another sector that we like as well more at the equity level so you mentioned is that overall energy transition  what are some other catalysts behind what s fueling the demand here for copper because i don t think investors realize that copper is behind a lot of different things that we use every day in our lives yeah  outside of electric vehicles  which of course take way more copper if you just look at the construction industry  that s the biggest um in terms of demand for copper that s doing quite well as we re building out infrastructure of course  that s  that s been a big key move here that  that we like as well when you think about just the resorting theme and utilities are another one that obviously um it would be another spot for  for the a i play in  in terms of uh the energy transition here i m not going to ask you to talk about a specific company  but hypothetically  let s say you ve got the world s biggest phone maker saying that they are going to utilize a i how much does a cfo of that company need to be worrying about the price of copper and the impact that could have as a potential head went on their balance sheet i don t think it s gonna be a major headwind when you think about the consumer  the elasticity of demand with  with smartphones right now of course  it doesn t  the price points have not been a major factor you can see that over the years as they ve continued to increase when you re talking about  2000 phones with demand  it  it hasn t been a big factor  but at the margin level  of course  as input prices go up  that could be a factor that could impact overall earnings and i want to go back to china because you did point out that the supply side there is a bit mixed why is that not a concern for you in the long run well  we re watching the supply side there overall because right now it s at record levels typically you see copper supplies in china elevate to really the 1st  1st quarter of a part of the year and then they start to dwindle as factory activity increases we re not seeing that quite yet but when you look at the futures curve of copper and this is why we re a little bit  um we re  we re discounting that a little bit is because we re in backwardation  meaning front month or spot prices are trading above second or third month contracts that suggests there s a tight copper market on a near term basis and supporting that i think bid into copper that we re seeing yeah  adam and closing out the china s uh impact in terms of commodities we are seeing muted demand coming from chinese fabricators as well so along with some of that profit taking  that could be a little bit of a temporary headwind for this commodity adam thanks so much for joining us that was adam turnquist he is lp l financials  chief technical strategist on all things copper now  looking ahead to the 2024 election  we ve got a new note out of jp morgan saying market consensus is for trump to win the white house but overall investors are not that concerned about the election  at least right now  only 12  of j pm survey respondents see the upcoming election as the biggest threat to the market rally let s bring in rick newman for more rick i immediately sat up when i saw this news because we ve all been talking about what the market is pricing in ahead of this election how big of a deal does this seem to you i think this uh market consensus is premature uh this race is basically a toss up and it s very possible that what whatever is going to turn the outcome  either to trump or biden  assume both of them make it to the finish line it s possible that that thing hasn t even happened yet uh i mean  i think we ve got uh more uh black swan risk than you normally would have an election given number one the age of these two candidates uh and everything that s going on with donald trump uh we re gonna have two debates uh the debates can be decisive  things can happen during those debates uh and let s just  let s not forget trump is now a convicted felon and there s gonna be a sentencing uh in july when he  he may actually get sentenced to jail time um so i  i think it  it would be a big mistake to assume that trump has this in the bag we still have almost five months to go until election day and there s just a ton that can happen between now and then  rick  you mentioned that first debate coming up at the end of this month what do you think is going to drive the conversation points in that debate is it the economy  is it geopolitical risks or is it something else well  i have to  i have to believe the moderators are going to raise the issue of  uh donald trump s conviction in the new york court a couple of weeks ago on 34 felony counts um i don t  i don t know that biden himself has to say too much about that but i think  uh i  i mean  i d  i d be astonished if that is not  you know  a huge focus of ads and billboards and swing state commercials  uh  you know  during the last two or three months of the election  um  i  i guess the  um  the moderators will ask about issues i mean  there are a lot of issues at stake here  especially for investors i mean  the big one is  uh  is these tax cuts  the 2017 tax cuts that expire at the end of 2025 so the next president is going to have a major role in that there s talk of either raising the corporate tax rate if you re joe biden  if president biden gets a second term or lowering the corporate tax rate if donald trump wins a second term  there are the tariffs on china that trump wants to impose and a lot of other factors for investors uh i  i mean  it s  i think it s just still too early for investors to be uh basically betting on the outcome of the election but i think that s gonna change in  uh in september and october i think we re gonna get a lot more intense focus on the polls in the six or seven swing states you might start to see the market go up or down based on what some polls show is because there are a lot of uh issues that uh the next president is going to have to determine that will affect markets all right  rick a lot to keep track of i know you ll be watching it for all of us thank you so much bye guys coming up the nba finals are in full swing and so are their media rights contract negotiations we hear an nba deputy commissioner mark tatum has to say next inflation and a strong job market has sent jitters the markets over the past few months as investors brace for the possibility that rates could be higher for longer but one investment vehicle has been seeing some benefits from the high rate environment  municipal bonds and joining us now and stand close head of municipal d  thank you so much for joining us now  there is this expectation that the fed could begin to cut rates later this year given that is now the appropriate time to put some money to work in munis sure and  and thank you so much for having me  ali i do appreciate it uh we certainly think so i mean  if you look at what s happened to muni s so far this year  there s been two broad themes one is treasury rates on 10 year treasuries has gone up 50 basis points so that s affected everything in fixed income  including munis and 50 basis points cheaper than we started the year uh and the second thing that s really impacted muni and why we think it s such great value right now is the supply of muni we ve seen supply go up of municipals through the end of may up 40  and with that  we ve had two back to back months  the months of april and may where we saw more than 40 billion of supply i think what that really does is it sets us up really well for the second half of the year  the second half of the year i don t think we re gonna see as much issuance we re hearing from underwriters we re hearing from issuers bankers that they re bringing deals forward that normally would happen in the fourth quarter so that they avoid the election and they avoid all the issues that happen in the 2016 election so i think we ll have less issuance and i think we re also gonna have a very  very good technical the next two months where you re gonna have  80 billion in coupons in maturing bonds in all these different proceeds that recycle back to the muni market very quickly and those are both very  very good technical backstops and  and i think as well as we were discussing right before  you know  six and a quarter percent for a aa intermediate muni strategy  i think is very attractive and  and nine and a quarter percent for a high yield i think is just a number which is going to go in and draw investors off the sideline yeah  i mean  those are significant yields particularly when we re used to talking about things like treasury corporate bonds the returns are just not as high i am curious in terms of risks for those returns how closely are you and municipal bond holders supposed to be watching the macro data and any potential softness we might be seeing in that data and what read through could that have to mu needs yes sure and we have 23 credit analysts at naveen where all they re doing is looking at the broader macro and  and i think as we  i take a step back and look at it  we don t usually see a high correlation between the economy and defaults in municipals uh by that i mean  you know  your water and sewer bill  you re not gonna go in and fail to pay your water and sewer bill no matter the economy it s a really inelastic demand curve for most of what these have these are essential service  monopolies  somewhat recession proof  somewhat recession proof and almost everything we see  we just don t see a large correlation between defaults in munis and where they were and where the economy is yes and  and given that  you know  the munis base very fragmented what sectors or areas are you most bullish on right now yes so more than 50 000 different issuers in the town i live in  i m just north of chicago there s nine issuers alone in that town so it is a very fragmented market on the high grade side we re really looking at local general obligation bonds these are uh bonds that are repaid by property taxes we think with the housing market continuing to do well  that s a very good place to be and they re offering very good yields on the high yield side  we re really favoring land secure deals these are deals that uh are financed by build outs in states like florida for potable water  for streetscapes and that are ultimately repaid by property taxes uh and  and different assessments so we re very bullish on those two we think those are gonna do very well uh recession or now here over the next uh couple of years  i do want to bring this a little bit closer to home here in new york city because governor kathy hole did move to kill congestion pricing policy and now some are calling on mt a muni bond holders to fight back against that move i want to pull up a post from the director of a nonprofit focusing on public enterprise saying that i m calling on anyone who purchased mt a muni bonds to come forward and bring the lot to bear on the state of new york i m not gonna ask you about congestion pricing we re not gonna get into that tit for tat here but i am just curious generally  how much power historically do many bond holders have over public policy and is this a way for investors  retail investors listening to this segment now to who are invested in local politics to maybe have another avenue of influence is not the word i m looking for but influence yeah well  and it s interesting to see that  that congestion pricing would have been uh we think very favorable for mini bonds you go in and you take a billion dollars in what we expected the revenue to be you could leverage it up to 15 billion by issuing debt that really helps out the capital structure you know  if you go in and you have fewer cars on the street because of the congestion pricing  then you also go in and support the  the fair backs bonds you know  owning mini bonds there s  you don t have uh unlike on the equity side where you could go in and you could vote for directors and you could vote for different uh governance issues we really don t have that as much as large holders uh in the mt a  we certainly do have influence but it s something traditionally asset managers  at least on the municipal bond side have really exercised to too much we uh we have 100 and 25 year history at naveen of providing tax exempt income part of that is also knowing that uh sometimes local matters and local affairs uh not weighing in on this much well  really quickly here  i know that you had a take for us on airports and uni bonds and obviously huge travel demand coming up this summer what read through does that have to airport bonds so airport bonds have done very well this year uh we ve seen about 3 5 billion of issuances so midway sfo had an issuance um we ve  we ve seen issuances come through and anticipate about 20 billion or so of issuance uh for the balance of the year so ii i think it s been interesting airport credit has done really well you think of airports that lost 80  of their top line revenue and yet we have more upgrades and downgrades and 25  of them are better rated than where they were before the pandemic so in airports  we expect uh more issuance and a lot of this issuance is not being driven by runways  it s not being driven by gates  it s being driven by the passenger experience lounges and rest restaurants and shopping and so it s more of an experience rather than uh that we re financing rather than the traditional brick and mortar so we do anticipate more airport issuance for the balance of the year  fully 20 billion for 2024 and 100 and 50 billion by the end of 27 really interesting  dan  it s always great to speak with you because you have an ability to bring muni bonds into the reality for folks so really appreciate it thank you for coming in studio thanks so much for having me well  that is dan close he is nave s head of municipals now  the nba finals are in full swing with game three between the celtics and mavericks kicking off tomorrow night in dallas while the games are still taking place on the court a little game for the nba executives deep in negotiations for their next media rights deal all i know you had the opportunity to sit down with nba deputy commissioner mark tatum yesterday what is sticking out to you from his comments about just the kind of back and forth of this deal yeah  so he declined to comment on the specifics of the actual negotiations  but he did talk about how fragmented the sports media rights landscape is right now and how as any type of league once in this day and age  not just the nba  but also the nfl and hlm will be  you want to be as diversified as possible with your media partner so we have a quick sound by that i want to play where he talks about that a little bit more so over the last 5 to 10 years  sports consumption has been defined by an increase in optionality for the fan and ultra personalization and so there are more ways than ever to watch sports programming nba content and what we re trying to do is make sure that no matter where the fan is that we re meeting them where they are  that we re customizing what they re seeing  the teams are seeing the players are interested in based on their preferences and so uh there s still very much a role for traditional television we very much like the fact that our uh finals are on traditional network television um but we also understand that a new generation of fans are consuming content through streaming platforms and so we wanna make sure uh that we have that availability of programming and content across all different channels so i  i think what you re gonna see is more of a hybrid  having our games both on traditional television and streaming in an effort to reach all of our fans so a hybrid approach there and if you think about the latest reporting around these media rights negotiations  that s exactly what s going to happen right now nbc universal espn that they re in the league for linear but also we have espn plus is that over the top streaming package  amazon also in talks for an streaming exclusive package as well and these are  this is a big amounts of money that a lot of these networks are willing to cough up i mean  amazon s 1 8 billion nbc universal reported 2 5 billion notice  noticeably missing here is warner brothers discoveries  tnt which has  you know  had this the rights to this league for so long  but they re just not coughing up the cash that these leagues want and it seems like tnt sort of missed the boat by sloughing off the importance of this deal early on is my interpretation at least and  and  and also more about discovery is going through a transition period their balance sheet is all over the place and some analysts have said  look  it might not make sense for them to pay this much for the nba while there are others that are like  no  this is very important that they have the nba moving forward so we ll see ultimately what happens these negotiations are still ongoing and long term  whether or not this is an overall headwind for viewership because the viewers are concerned about and questioning just where they need to it s complicated they re just gonna end up going to the local restaurant at least that s what they re gonna be going to the bar to watch because it s the only way they can find the true ability to guarantee they re gonna be able to watch a great interview thanks so much for bringing that to us we re gonna have all of your markets action ahead right here so stay tuned for more you re watching catalysts we ve been discussing apple s latest event all morning and the reaction seems mixed d a davidson upgraded apple and raised its price target on the back of the announcement  we had a chance to speak to the analyst behind that call  gloria earlier today here s what he had to say a lot of noise  a lot of people with different expectations coming in but if you look at the signal away from the noise  you realize that this is unprecedented capabilities that apple is gonna introduce and it s going to integrate a i into everyday life meanwhile  apple shareholder ken mahoney was a bit more muted in his reaction and predicted we may see a slight short term downturn this summer take a listen look  we re in this mix here i ve been telling investors we could hit a low with apple over the summer time as why would you want to upgrade your  you know  your phone here why not wait for the 15 or the 16 and so forth so we could hit a little low interesting to see the varying reactions that we ve had across wall street  across shareholders but if you take a look at the share price right now  we are up more than 5  surpassing an intra day high market cap at around 3 2 trillion so at least right now it seems like investors are digesting all of the announcements that we did get and with the positive where as last night  we saw the stock of around 2  and this is so important apples hitting new all time highs today and this is critical because this is a stock that just flipped in a positive year to date territory in a matter of the last couple of weeks you can see on that chart here just happening in the month of june apple  finally flipping in a positive year to date territory that was a huge issue for one of the big tech names  not just for apple  of course  but for the broader market to have this much pressure on a  3 trillion company as of today because of the market moves to the upside that we re seeing this stock up 9 5 percent year to date so really a big turnaround story that is exactly what apple was hoping to do and at least when you look at the stock price  they did deliver  it s interesting to see that the market reaction was negative after getting the news from the developers conference yesterday so perhaps after seeing some of the consumer commentary off of that  also hearing some and seeing in some of the notes this morning that it was a little bit of a buy the rumor  sell the news the kind of optimism around the stock was a little bit priced in but looks like there s a lot more optimism to go for this stock we didn t even talk about the gen moji announcement  how you can generate your own emoji just but i mean the millennial in me is very excited about this the calculator on the ipad there s a lot of features outside of a i was as well are you excited for the react too i m such a react girl the fact that i can be creative with my message reacts i like  yeah  i wanna have some fun let s let  let s let s get that i m only already anticipating the gen moji my friends are going to be sending back and forth in our group chat so i love it all and i the key millennial sources  we will be driving the new trends and apple replies absolutely it comes to emojis all right  everyone will coming up here  we re gonna have wealth it s dedicated to all of your personal finance needs our very own brad smith has for the next hour stay t for more ',

                        "Since the initial public offering of Shopify (NYSE: SHOP) in 2015, its shares have been a stunning success -- gaining 2,100% in value. The S&P 500 added just 200% over that time. Is it too late to invest in this e-commerce platform? Perhaps not.Recent volatility has provided a rare buying opportunity. Over the past 90 days, shares have lost around 25% of their value after management delivered weak guidance for the quarter ahead. If you're looking for a high-quality, high-growth business at a discount, this could be your chance.A competitive advantage that should grow strongerShopify is a terrific business. At its core, it's an e-commerce platform. But instead of operating its own marketplace like Amazon, it empowers others to build their own digital stores. By using Shopify, entrepreneurs and existing brands can begin selling online in minutes. Shopify's platform comes with everything you need to get started: design templates, inventory tools, payment processing, advertising integrations, analytics dashboards, and much more.Shopify's platform has a heavy lead over the competition when it comes to usability and functionality. The latest market share figures demonstrate this well. According to data compiled by Statista, Shopify currently has a 28% market share of e-commerce software platforms in United States. WooCommerce comes in at second place with 17%, while Wix takes third with 16%.When it comes to platform businesses like Shopify, the strong typically grow stronger. Platform businesses essentially allow other people to build on top of them. Meta Platforms, for instance, owns several platform businesses, including Instagram and Facebook. These companies simply produce basic software and functionality. It is the users themselves, however, that build out the vast majority of the content.The same is true for Shopify. The company has an impressive software offering, but it is outside developers that have built much of the functionality. These developers earn money whenever a Shopify customer installs and uses its features. And Shopify gains significantly more functionality far faster than what it could build on its own.With the biggest market share in the industry, Shopify garners the most attention from outside developers. After all, they want to build things that can reach the greatest number of people, and thus earn them the most money. Additionally, Shopify has more storefronts than any competing platform -- more than 1 million.All of these users provide Shopify with tons of data, giving insights into how they use the platform and what they value, and highlighting areas where they'd like to see the software improve. One of those areas is AI-enabled tools, and Shopify is investing in this area arguably more than any of its competition. Shopify simply has more capital, clout, and reach to do so.Story continuesShopify is targeting a truly huge market. E-commerce spending topped $1 trillion in 2023, and is expected to approach $2 trillion by 2029. The company has the tech and resources to keep growing its market share in an otherwise growing market. And as we'll soon see, right now is a great time to invest in this long term winner.Why it's not too late to buy Shopify stockShopify stock has been a great long term winner, but it hasn't always been smooth sailing. From 2016 to 2022, shares rose 5,200% in value. Since those highs, however, the shares have fallen by more than 50%.SHOP ChartThere have been many sudden ups and downs along the way for Shopify stock. At times, the stock traded as high as 60 times sales. At their lowest, shares traded at just 9 times sales. After the recent pullback, the stock is valued at only 10.2 times sales -- a historic bargain.Right now, Shopify is a terrific growth stock priced at a very reasonable valuation, especially relative to its history. Goldman Sachs even upgraded the stock recently to \"buy\" from \"neutral,\" citing its \"significant technology moat.\" This is a company you want to buy and hold for the long term, and today's bargain valuation gives new investors a great chance at catching Shopify's second wave.Should you invest $1,000 in Shopify right now?Before you buy stock in Shopify, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Shopify wasn’t one of them.

                        "All it takes is one incredible growth stock to supercharge your portfolio. If you find that high-growth stock, it can make up for other mediocre ones, and even losses. That's one of the reasons a diversified portfolio is important. No one knows what the future will bring, and you want your eggs spread out in different baskets.Global-e Online (NASDAQ: GLBE) is a high-growth stock that's trading close to its lowest-ever valuation, and growth investors should consider buying it at these prices.The best e-commerce stock you haven't heard ofGlobal-e markets a business-to-business platform for e-commerce retailers to engage in cross-border commerce. Users plug it into their websites, and it gives them the ability to offer a large selection of international services on their checkout pages, from localized currencies to instant customs calculations and varied shipping options.These are the kinds of services every retailer needs to begin shipping internationally, and Global-e makes it easy. It's not surprising that it adds new, high-profile clients on a regular basis, or that it's been demonstrating phenomenal growth.Gross merchandise volume (GMV) increased 32% year over year in the 2024 first quarter, and revenue was up 24%. In the quarter the company added Heydude by Crocs and Donna Karan in the U.S., as well as luggage brand Antler and SoHo Home in the U.K., in addition to others. It also expanded many partnerships, such as adding new regions for Adidas and new brands for Coty.Global-e has a partnership with e-commerce giant Shopify, which recently launched a white-label cross-border solution for its merchants called Shopify Market Pro. It also recently signed a deal with Wix.com to provide its services on Wix's e-commerce sites.Management is guiding for growth to accelerate in the second half of the year, with some planned large partnerships launching and momentum building in the Shopify Market Pro business. Global-e said that it has dozens of brands going live, as well as a strong pipeline of new clients. The company raised its outlook for revenue, GMV, and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) for the full year after the first-quarter earnings release.But it's the long-term outlook that looks most compelling. Global-e is still a young company, and could really take off when the economy improves. E-commerce continues to grow in importance and as a percentage of overall retail sales, and as we shift into a global economy, Global-e's services will become even more in demand.Story continuesPutting the risks on the tableThe main risk for Global-e right now is that it's not profitable, although profitability metrics have been improving. Gross profit increased 38% year over year, outpacing revenue growth, and gross margin expanded from 41.2% to 43.4%. Adjusted EBITDA improved from $14.5 million to $21.3 million, and net loss contracted from $43.1 million to $32.1 million.Those are solid improvements, but they're still a ways off from generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) profitability. Part of Global-e's partnership with Shopify includes warrants for Shopify to buy Global-e stock that Global-e amortized as expenses. These are taking a chunk out of the total right now, and they won't be fully amortized until 2025.Although management is guiding for accelerated growth in the second half of the year, the company could still be negatively impacted by continued inflation and the potential for a recession. Many of its clients target upscale customers, which provides some resilience. But any company that deals in retail is susceptible to these risks when there's economic volatility.To me at least, the growth story looks much more compelling than the risks right now.A price too cheap to ignoreGlobal-e is growing and becoming more profitable, but Global-e stock is training near its lowest-ever price-to-sales ratio.GLBE PS Ratio ChartIt might be farfetched to call a price-to-sales ratio of 8 objectively cheap, but Global-e is a high-growth stock with tons of future potential, which is why its stock demands a premium. This is a great opportunity to scoop up shares and benefit as Global-e stock keeps on climbing.Should you invest $1,000 in Global-E Online right now?Before you buy stock in Global-E Online, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Global-E Online wasn’t one of them.

                        'all it takes is one incredible growth stock to supercharge your portfolio  if you find that high growth stock  it can make up for other mediocre ones  and even losses  that s one of the reasons a diversified portfolio is important  no one knows what the future will bring  and you want your eggs spread out in different baskets global e online  nasdaq  glbe  is a high growth stock that s trading close to its lowest ever valuation  and growth investors should consider buying it at these prices the best e commerce stock you haven t heard ofglobal e markets a business to business platform for e commerce retailers to engage in cross border commerce  users plug it into their websites  and it gives them the ability to offer a large selection of international services on their checkout pages  from localized currencies to instant customs calculations and varied shipping options these are the kinds of services every retailer needs to begin shipping internationally  and global e makes it easy  it s not surprising that it adds new  high profile clients on a regular basis  or that it s been demonstrating phenomenal growth gross merchandise volume  gmv  increased 32  year over year in the 2024 first quarter  and revenue was up 24   in the quarter the company added heydude by crocs and donna karan in the u s   as well as luggage brand antler and soho home in the u k   in addition to others  it also expanded many partnerships  such as adding new regions for adidas and new brands for coty global e has a partnership with e commerce giant shopify  which recently launched a white label cross border solution for its merchants called shopify market pro  it also recently signed a deal with wix com to provide its services on wix s e commerce sites management is guiding for growth to accelerate in the second half of the year  with some planned large partnerships launching and momentum building in the shopify market pro business  global e said that it has dozens of brands going live  as well as a strong pipeline of new clients  the company raised its outlook for revenue  gmv  and adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization  ebitda  for the full year after the first quarter earnings release but it s the long term outlook that looks most compelling  global e is still a young company  and could really take off when the economy improves  e commerce continues to grow in importance and as a percentage of overall retail sales  and as we shift into a global economy  global e s services will become even more in demand story continuesputting the risks on the tablethe main risk for global e right now is that it s not profitable  although profitability metrics have been improving  gross profit increased 38  year over year  outpacing revenue growth  and gross margin expanded from 41 2  to 43 4   adjusted ebitda improved from  14 5 million to  21 3 million  and net loss contracted from  43 1 million to  32 1 million those are solid improvements  but they re still a ways off from generally accepted accounting principles  gaap  profitability  part of global e s partnership with shopify includes warrants for shopify to buy global e stock that global e amortized as expenses  these are taking a chunk out of the total right now  and they won t be fully amortized until 2025 although management is guiding for accelerated growth in the second half of the year  the company could still be negatively impacted by continued inflation and the potential for a recession  many of its clients target upscale customers  which provides some resilience  but any company that deals in retail is susceptible to these risks when there s economic volatility to me at least  the growth story looks much more compelling than the risks right now a price too cheap to ignoreglobal e is growing and becoming more profitable  but global e stock is training near its lowest ever price to sales ratio glbe ps ratio chartit might be farfetched to call a price to sales ratio of 8 objectively cheap  but global e is a high growth stock with tons of future potential  which is why its stock demands a premium  this is a great

                        'Here are seven high-octane tech stocks to buy for May. These companies are on pace for rapid growth thanks to strong fundamentals and innovative business models that promise long-term gains for investors.Given the rising S&P 500 and Nasdaq indices, which generally signal robust market conditions, investors should look for tech stocks that can capitalize on these trends. The three companies discussed in this article stand out due to their ability to overcome challenges and leverage broader market opportunities.Their strengths, including accelerating revenue growth and profitability, indicate that they are well-positioned to thrive. Instead of sticking to a broad-based ETF, investors should consider these high-potential names, especially since I predict the AI boom will drive significant advancements in the tech sector for some time to come.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSo here are seven high-octane tech stocks to buy for this month.High-Octane Tech Stocks to Buy: Coinbase (COIN)Coinbase (COIN), is an American company that operates a cryptocurrency exchange platform. Ethereum (ETH-USD) coin on the background of the Coinbase inscription.Source: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock.comCoinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) has benefited from the surge in cryptocurrency prices, particularly Bitcoin (BTC-USD). The company’s return to profitability and the increasing popularity of crypto transactions position it well for future growth.Coinbase’s stock price increased by approximately 300%, underscoring its strong position in the digital asset market. The approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs supports this growth.In the first quarter of 2024, Coinbase reported significant financial improvements with revenue reaching $1.64 billion, up 122% from the same period in 2023, and a net income of $1.18 billion, a stark contrast to the loss reported in the previous year.Coinbase’s future outlook remains optimistic. The company forecasts continued institutional investment in Bitcoin and anticipates favorable macroeconomic conditions and regulatory advancements, which are expected to support long-term adoption of cryptocurrencies.COIN is one of my top picks for this year and I think we’ve only started to see the potential of the company.Meta Platforms (META)In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logoSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.comMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) has demonstrated impressive growth, particularly with a 25% year-over-year (YOY) increase in Q4 revenue, reaching $40.11 billion. The company is focusing on efficiency, scaling back costs, and enhancing AI technologies.This strong performance is attributed to a positive shift in ad pricing growth and robust online commerce advertising. The increase in ad pricing marks a return to growth for the first time since Q4 2021, bolstered by significant contributions from China-based advertisers.The company plans to invest $30-37 billion in capital expenditures for 2024, primarily in AI and non-AI hardware, and data centers. This investment is aimed at supporting its long-term AI research and product development efforts. This growth is supported by the successful implementation of cost management strategies and increased monetization efforts through features like Reels and WhatsApp Channels​.Story continuesMETA could be one of those undervalued picks in the stock market for aggressive investors, which is why I recommend it as one to watch.High-Octane Tech Stocks to Buy: Qualcomm (QCOM)An image of the top half of a black smartphone with a white screen displaying a blue "Qualcomm" logo, with a blurry white "Qualcomm" logo on a blue design in the background.Source: nikkimeel / Shutterstock.comQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) plays a critical role in the expansion of 5G networks and mobile technology. Despite a recent slowdown in mobile phone sales, the company’s strong position in the 5G market and a robust dividend yield make it an attractive long-term investment​.In the second fiscal quarter of 2024, Qualcomm reported strong financial results, with revenues reaching $9.4 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $2.44, surpassing analyst expectations. This growth was driven by increased sales in handset and automotive chips. Despite a slight decline in gross margins, the company’s financial performance remains solid.Looking ahead, Qualcomm has set ambitious growth targets. The company expects its QCT segment to achieve mid-teens compound annual growth rates (CAGR) and maintain operating margins above 30% by fiscal 2024. Additionally, Qualcomm projects automotive revenues to grow to approximately $3.5 billion in five years and $8 billion in ten years.Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) continues to gain market share in the semiconductor industry with strong performance in its Data Center and Client segments. In the first quarter of 2024, AMD reported revenue of $5.5 billion, marking a 2% YOY increase. The company also achieved a non-GAAP gross margin of 52% and a net income of $123 million.Looking ahead, AMD has set an optimistic outlook for 2024, expecting revenue to reach approximately $5.7 billion in the second quarter, representing a 6% YOY growth. This positive projection is driven by increased demand for its high-performance computing products.The company’s focus on edge AI with its Ryzen line positions it well to dominate in this emerging market. CEO Lisa Su has projected the AI accelerator market to reach $400 billion by 2027, nearly 300% growth from this year.AMD is a great alternative to the likes of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), as it has a far lower valuation than the microchip giant.High-Octane Tech Stocks to Buy: Shopify (SHOP)Shopify on the phone display.Source: Burdun Iliya / Shutterstock.comShopify (NYSE:SHOP) remains a leader in e-commerce platforms, with significant revenue growth and recent profitability.In Q4 2023, Shopify reported a 24% increase in revenue, reaching $2.1 billion. The company also achieved a free cash flow of $905 million, compared to a negative free cash flow of $186 million the previous year. This marked a significant turnaround.For the first quarter of 2024, Shopify projects revenue growth at a low-twenties percentage rate on a YOY basis. This translates into a mid-to-high-twenties growth rate when adjusted for the impact of selling its logistics businesses. Gross margin for Q1 is on track to increase by approximately 150 basis points compared to Q4 2023.SHOP is one of my favorite picks for investors seeking one of those high-octane tech stocks for gains. Despite these positive indicators, Shopify’s stock experienced a decline due to lower-than-expected free cash flow guidance for 2024. I still think that long-term SHOP should be on investors’ radars.Coupang (CPNG)The Coupang (CPNG stock) campus in Silicon Valley, California.Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comCoupang (NYSE:CPNG) is expanding into new verticals like travel and dining. Despite a significant drop from its IPO price, analysts forecast strong earnings and revenue growth, with a projected stock price target averaging $26.67, suggesting a potential upside of 19.2% from the current price.Coupang’s diversified services include Rocket Fresh for grocery delivery, Coupang Eats for restaurant ordering and delivery, and Coupang Play for online content streaming. These offerings have significantly boosted customer engagement, supported by over 100 fulfillment centers across South Korea.Financially, Coupang has consistently reported positive cash flows. In the last four quarters, the company achieved an operating cash flow of $2.6 billion and free cash flow of $1.9 billion. This positive financial performance is further highlighted by a 27% YOY increase in gross profits to $1.6 billion.CPNG could be a good pick for investors who want to diversify their portfolios outside of the United States, as CPNG is essentially the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) of South Korea.Li Auto (LI)Li Auto (Li Xiang) brand logo and electric car in store. A Chinese EV(electric vehicle) companySource: Robert Way / Shutterstock.comLi Auto (NASDAQ:LI), a Chinese EV manufacturer, has shown impressive growth, with revenue increasing by 271% last quarter. It outsold Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) in China for October 2023, and its hybrid EVs are gaining significant market share in China. The company delivered 80,400 vehicles in Q1 2024.Additionally, the company is advancing its autonomous driving technology, with plans to roll out AD Max 3.0, featuring full-scenario autonomous driving capabilities and enhanced safety systems.Financially, Li Auto has consistently reported positive cash flows, with Q3 2023 showing a free cash flow of $1.8 billion. The company also achieved a gross profit margin of 25.3% and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 3.9%.Chinese-brand EVs like Li will likely continue to perform strongly, even despite Biden’s recent tariffs on these companies. Asia is fast becoming the hotspot for the market, and I feel that this will continue to grow in the future.On the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

This week's Motley Fool Money radio show starts now. It's the Motley Fool Money radio show. I'm Dylan Lewis joining me in the studio. Motley Fool Senior Analyst Matt Argersinger and Jason Moser. Gentlemen, great to have you both here. We've got the stock Buffett's been secretly buying the whole story from Whole Foods co-founder John Mackey and of course, stocks on our radar. We're going to start out this week checking in on the market. This week, the Dow kissed 40k for the first time ever. Matt, not able to hold it there, but we will note a milestone, when a milestone comes.Matthew Argersinger: It is a milestone and I know it's a meaningless number. Who cares? Dow 39,000, 40,000, but it's it's a big round number, so I think we should celebrate it and we're in the middle of a bull market. I have some interesting facts and a few questions for you guys regarding the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which made its debut in May of 1896. Its first computed average was 41 points across 100 for the first time on January 12th, 1906. JMo, do you know the largest company in the Dow, was on January 12th, 1906?Story continuesJason Moser: I don't, but I'm going to take a stab at the dark and just say General Electric.Matthew Argersinger: The total. Dylan?Dylan Lewis: I'm going to say oil, Standard Oil.Matthew Argersinger: You got what you guys are in the general area, it's it was US Steel, Dow's largest company. The Dow first crossed with 1,000 big number on November 14th, 972. Sixty years later, what was the largest company on January or starting November 14, 1972.Dylan Lewis: In the Dow?Matthew Argersinger: In the Dow.Dylan Lewis: I'm going to take his guess from before and say General Electric.Jason Moser: Yeah, I'm going to keep on saying General Electric things.Dylan Lewis: Well, you're going to keep on.Matthew Argersinger: It was IBM in 1972. Dow first cross 10,000 in the middle of the.com boom, March 29, 1999. What was the largest company in the Dow on that date?Jason Moser: Cisco. It's a great guess. I'm going to go back to IBM, the previous.Matthew Argersinger: General Electric.Jason Moser: Should have stuck with it.Matthew Argersinger: Interestingly enough, Microsoft was the biggest company by market cap in March 29, 1999. But it was not in the Dow. It didn't get into the Dow until November of that year. At that time, GE was still the biggest. Dow first cross 20,000 on January 25, 2017, not long time ago. What was the biggest company in the Dow on January 25, 2017?Jason Moser: I feel like Apple was in there by them. I don't remember when they got added. I can't remember the day, but I'm going to guess Apple because they feel like they were in there by then.Dylan Lewis: I'm going to follow JMo on that one.Matthew Argersinger: You guys are right.Jason Moser: Finally got it.Matthew Argersinger: Apple was added in 2015, so yes, on January 25, 2017, it was the biggest Dow component. By-market cap. Dow first cross a 30,000 on November 24, 2020. Just three-plus years later. What was the biggest company on November 24, 2020?Dylan Lewis: Amazon.Jason Moser: I don't know if Amazon was in there at that point. I'm going to guess Home Depot.Matthew Argersinger: No, but it was Apple still. Which was much bigger than of course it's still the biggest. Now, the Dow first cross 40,000 didn't hold it but cross 40,000 for the first time on Thursday. What is the biggest company in the Dow right now.Jason Moser: Is Microsoft in the Dow? I don't think Microsoft is in the Dow, is it?Dylan Lewis: I don't think so. I'm going to go to Amazon.Jason Moser: It's Apple. Is it Apple? It has to be?Matthew Argersinger: It's Microsoft. It was as this out back in 1999 and now it didn't. It was not the biggest company for a long time, but of course, it just recently went past Apple. It's bigger than a bigger than Apple by about 5%. It is the biggest Dow component right now.Dylan Lewis: What I like about what Matt he's doing here because one of the things with the Dow is, it's had this reputation for so long of being old, stodgy, outdated industrials, boring and it's not really up to speed with our tech-driven world today. But I think that's one point to note with the Dow is that it's evolved. It's become a little bit more relevant to the modern-day economy in those days where we issued it. I think those days are over. We can look at it with a little bit more credibility today because of its components.Jason Moser: I think a lot of people will bemoan the fact that it's still a Price-weighted index which feels outdated. It's only 30 components, 31 I think because anyway, because it's a company that has two classes. But either way, it is still the most quoted index I think around the world, if you watch any kind of news, especially for not watching businesses we watch be rushing regular mainstream news. What's the number they always go to? It's always the Dow. Until the Dow was up 300 points and Dow is not this. It's still very relevant.Dylan Lewis: Can you make a point with the price-weighted versus the S&P, which is market cap weighted for two very different perspectives.Matthew Argersinger: Don't sleep on the Dow, I think is the takeaway. Also maybe we need to study up a little bit on the Dow Components. Jason, I will put this wellness labor, all this data by the way, I pulled from NAI chatbot. I think it's I fact check some of it so I think it's right, but don't quote me if you're a Dow historian listening to this radio show right now.Dylan Lewis: We've got smartly AI smart talk coming up in the second segment on today's show, but I wanted to take us to a Dow company that did not come up in that discussion. That's Walmart very much doing its part to lift the Dow this week and help it touch that 40k number. Shares up 7% to a new all-time high, Jason. That's because Company Earnings results this week look pretty strong.Jason Moser: They did. This is an environment where Walmart should shine. The consumer is becoming a bit more discerning regarding prices and what they're spending. We've seen that just all over earning season in Walmart's value tilt, I think, should prove to be a big driver for the company in the coming quarters, when you look at the results. Revenue growth 5.8% in constant currency. Walmart, U.S. Delivered better-than-expected growth those comps sales were up 3.8%. They ultimately saw their adjusted operating profit up 13%. Doing a great job of bringing that down to the bottom line. You see operating leverage with companies like these that really do a good job of monetizing that fixed cost base. Some encouraging statistics, e-commerce up 21%. The advertising business, you got to dig in a little bit to get some context there. But the global advertising business grew 24%. This is becoming a little bit more of an ad play as well. You'd like to see them diversify that revenue stream inventories in good shape. I think the most interesting part, given their presence in grocery, grocery remains a big part. They've introduced a new private-label brand called better goods. Very much focused on the value side of things. Seventy percent of better goods items are priced under $5. That is sure to attract the grocery consumer.Dylan Lewis: I look at some of the market conditions here, Jason and you mentioned. Consumers trading down groceries are huge part of this company's business. Some of these private label initiatives bringing some things that you can only get from Walmart. Seems to me like they are trying to create a longer-term relationship with some of these consumers that are trying them, maybe trading down into them and then keeping them as customers beyond this more pinched period.Matthew Argersinger: There's just no question and you've seen examples throughout history of companies that have done this very well. I think Whole Foods stands out as one they've done with the 365 brand. Look at a company like Trader Joe's, not a publicly traded company, but something very similar in that line. Companies have just done a very good job of building CostCo with Kirkland, another great one. It makes absolute sense for Walmart to try to build that identification a little bit with this better goods brand and I suspect it'll do well.Dylan Lewis: Less glamorous results this week from Home Depot. Earnings ahead of expectations. Revenue lagged Matt, both down year over year.Matthew Argersinger: Just not a lot to build on here, Dylan. See what I did there. Comparable store sales continued to decline year-over-year down 2.8% in the quarter. It was tough to see both customer transactions and average ticket size, lower. Management said there was a delayed start to spring. Can spring actually get delayed?Dylan Lewis: It feel like it's being delayed here. Certainly been getting the rain.Matthew Argersinger: That's the weather argument. I get it. They also said, of course, and they've been saying this for several quarters now and there's a big ticket items continued to be slow. That's has a lot to do with the tight housing market with high mortgage rates, just not a lot of movement in the existing home side, which is keeping renovations down. A couple of things i did like what they had to say, which is management. They did reaffirm full-year guidance. They didn't reduce it like they have been doing. I like that CEO Ted Decker and team, they're really moving hard and fast into that Pro segment, really trying to grow Home Depot's market share there. They acquired SRS distribution, which is a big distributor to professional customers, primarily who do work in roofing, landscaping and Pool work. Slow period right now for Home Depot, I'd like the investments they're making. I think when the housing market does finally turnaround, they're going to be in a pretty good position.Dylan Lewis: We're just saying Walmart, huge beneficiary of consumers trading down, I thought was really interesting. Richard McPhail, CFO of Home Depot, saying they are not seeing customers trading down and they are not seeing people move to cheaper power tools, cheaper appliances and they are deferring those purchases. Do you feel like there is probably some pent-up demand for Home Depot products once we get to a better consumer environment.Matthew Argersinger: Absolutely. I think that's the case. I think it's all about really getting this existing home market unstuck. I agree, by the way, power tools, they get old over time. I think there is a lot of pent-up demand there probably right now.Jason Moser: I think he's exactly right. When you start moving, you buy a new house rented a new place. Home Depot and they're built, those are the first place is you go. When this thing loosens up a little bit, I suspect we'll see those transaction and that traffic number, those singles to start rising again.Dylan Lewis: Coming up after the break, we've got dives into AI demos from Google and OpenAI and Berkshire's latest buy. Stay right here. This is Motley Fool Money.Ricky Mulvey: Ricky Mulvey with Motley Fool Money here to tell you about a vehicle that is redefining sporting luxury, the Range Rover Sport. The first thing I noticed when I sat down in the driver's seat that I felt like I was in a cockpit up off the ground and focused interior that promotes exhilarating driver engagement. I also really appreciated the overhead 360-degree camera view that let me know exactly where I was going. Zoe's backing out of the parking space. One for a drive in the Range Rover Sport out in Littleton, Colorado, tested the accelerator just a little bit, felt the performance and agility. It's an instinctive drive with engaging on-road dynamics and effortless composure. Put it plainly, the Range Rover Sport is powerful. It's also quiet, uncomfortable, advanced cabin technologies such as active noise cancellation and cabin air purification, offer new levels of comfort and refinement. The third-generation Range Rover Sport, is the most desirable, advanced and dynamically capable yet. I would like to invite you to visit landroverusa.com to learn more about the Range Rover Sport.Dylan Lewis: Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. I'm Dylan Lewis here in studio with Matt Argersinger and Jason Moser. Guys, Berkshire's annual meeting was a few weeks ago, but investors didn't quite get everything that was on Warren Buffett's mind. This week 13F filing out saying what Berkshire has been buying and selling, and we have ourselves a new Buffett stock. Jason Berkshire disclosed. It's been building a position in Chubb, a property-casualty insurer. Does this surprise you at all as Buffett stock?Jason Moser: No. Not even a little bit. This seems right up his alley. I mean, I'm not even surprised really at the size of the investment of $6.8 billion tag is what I read. This makes a lot of sense. It feels like Buffett is just channeling as is Alexander Peter Lynch buy what you know. You listen to him. He said it, property casualty insurance provides the core of Berkshire's well-being and growth. Chubb is one of the largest players in that market. It makes perfect sense for Berkshire and for Buffett to go ahead and make that investment there. Chubb itself, it's got a long history. It's a company that has performed very well over time. I was looking at the returns on the stock. Over the last ten years, the total return on Chubb is up almost 220% and outperforming the market nicely. It's got a good track record there. Then, if I recall correctly this stake, he started building the stake in the back half of 2023. Just looking at 2023 in Chubb's 10-K, they quoted 2023 as an exceptional year, double-digit premium growth and they talked about a P&C property and casualty combined ratio of 86.5%, which is impressive. Now for those who aren't aware, the combined ratio is it's a popular metric in the insurance world. It's ultimately the incurred losses plus expenses divided by the earned premium revenue. You want to see that number below 100%. Below 100 is good. Eighty six and a half percent obviously well below 100. You look at other companies like Markel company that we follow here. They've done a very good job through the years of keeping that combined ratio in pretty good shape. But he just, he bought a good performer in what is obviously a very crucial market in something that he knows very well. It makes lot of sense, Matt, a lot of speculation here because the ACC had granted Buffett a confidentiality exemption in Q4 for their 13F as they were building up this position. Certainly a lot of investors following Buffett into Chubb shares were up seven percent this week on the news. What do you see when you look at the business?Matthew Argersinger: I'm surprised and not surprised because I think one of the bedding favorites was Charles Schwab. A lot of investors we're talking about, but you're right. For everything that Jason said, this makes a ton of sense and I can understand why Buffett wanted keep this one under wraps. It's hard. It's hard for Berkshire to build a meaningful position in anything these days. Six and a half billion dollar position takes time. I can see why he wanted to do that because Chubb is trading at a pretty good valuation. It's 11 times earnings, pays a nice dividend. That's been growing and so had that been revealed earlier, I can imagine that Berkshire Buffet wouldn't have gotten the price, that they've gotten in the stock.Dylan Lewis: Price would have creeped up just a little bit.Matthew Argersinger: I think so. It has.Dylan Lewis: People tend to pay attention when Warren Buffett is buying. People also paying attention when Warren Buffett is selling. I think one of the other things I noticed in the 13F was Buffett is a net seller of stocks for the quarter. Jason, any surprises there for you?Jason Moser: That is a little bit of a surprise. He talks often about being net buyers. That's something we espouse here, trying to accumulate that stuff over time. But the flip side of that is you're doing it for something. Eventually you get to an age where you want to reap those benefits, and so you got to sell. To be able to reap those benefits. Now, I'm not saying that's exactly what's going on here. I think what they got fully out of the paramount position, which was well loser, that happens, but that was a pretty big position. I think they took close to a $2 billion loss on that investment. We know that he trimmed a decent bit of Apple. I'm starting to wonder if I think that might've been prudent move. You start to look at Apple these days and the way they're operating in this AI environment. That's the company that you just don't hear a whole heck of a lot from. You are hearing from Microsoft and Alphabet and Chat, OpenAI and whatnot and Apple just seems to be on the back-burner there. Now, so maybe he saw the valuation and Apple and the size of his stake incited, determined that position was worth.Dylan Lewis: I think one of the things that does give people a little bit of pause when they see Buffett selling is there's no shortage of cash when it comes to Berkshire. I have to ask the question, Matt. He's not freeing up money to buy something else. He's got the money on that.Matthew Argersinger: That's what I was just going to say. He's up to 189 billion now in cash and short-term securities. That's just the highest it's ever been, and so is above. I have to say at this point, I think Buffett never vocally or verbally makes a morphic call. But I just feel like he's making a little bit of a call here. Almost 200 billion in cash, a net seller of stocks. Maybe he's just not finding a lot of value right now and that's worth thinking about.Dylan Lewis: If investors are following Chubb, following Berkshire into Chubb, maybe also put some cash on the side, create some opportunities for yourself to buy some things down the road.Matthew Argersinger: Maybe Berkshire needs to think about instituting a dividend right there with all of that cash, with that awesome portfolio, with that tremendous operating model. I keep wondering if we're not going to see that come to fruition here over the course of the next year.Jason Moser: Unfortunately, it's going to be Greg Abel's call. Will see. You asked me you probably at least a few years now, hopefully.Dylan Lewis: A big week in the world of AI, new demos out from Alphabet's Google and OpenAI. Jason, I want to start with Google's IO event because the narrative around this company has generally been missteps and late to the game. We saw some pretty impressive stuff this week.Jason Moser: We did. I think that's very well said. Looking at everything that's been going on in AI, and there were these questions as to whether Google's model is being disrupted and where they making the investments that were needed. There was a great blog post this week from Liz Reid, the head of Google search. It really, it dug into a lot of what Google is doing in search. Particularly with this AI overviews product, which is ultimately just its AI organized results pages. One of the concerns in regard to Google and AI and how they will incorporate this, would it cannibalize their business? It seems like they saw round that corner and have come up with a way to where they might be able to avoid that in a quote from this blog posts that I just think it's important to read. She said, I quote, \"With AI overviews, people are visiting a greater diversity of websites for help with more complex questions. We see that the links included in AI overviews get more clicks than if the page had appeared as a traditional web listing for that query.\" I think that is a very positive development that may have come up with a way to essentially enhance their search, make it better with AI without necessarily disrupting or cannibalizing it.Dylan Lewis: One of the things I like about what we're seeing from Google and the developments from Google is they are user-facing. They are immediately brought into these products that people are already familiar with. I think it maybe starts to quell some of those fears about how does this get incorporated into the business in a way that's meaningful? We also had updates from OpenAI, some fresh demos out this week. They are kind of in their own little garden a little bit. They aren't as incorporated into a visible products, so you have to be a user here. But Jason, one of the things that really jumped out to me was the translation capabilities and just the ability of their product to make sense of things that aren't texts, moving beyond simple text.Jason Moser: I'm sure it's going to take some time to really nail this down and get it to where it is. It is fail-safe. But I think GPT-4o, I watch some of those videos in the video interaction with this personal assistant. You're now talking about interacting with this personal assistant on your phone and that assistant being able to recognize the world around you. Seeing you and seeing what you're wearing and what you're doing. This is a big step forward. We've seen what these AI models they do a very good job of recognizing and processing text. Video is that next leap forward. It sounds like they're well on their way.Dylan Lewis: It always feels like there are steps to those aha moments for me and this felt like a big step. I agree. Jason Moser and Matt Argersinger, fellows, we're going to see you guys a little bit later in the show. Up next, we've got one of the giants in groceries. Talking through growing a retail concept. Stay right here. You're listening to Motley Fool Money.Dylan Lewis: Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. I'm Dylan Lewis. Each week with our interviews, we look to borrow the brains of someone that can make us a little bit smarter about the world of business and better investors and shareholders. This week, I caught up with Whole Foods Co-Founder and CEO John Mackey about his latest book, The Whole Story. Mackey talked me through lessons learned in growing store footprint and how to evaluate a company's mission and management from the outside. The whole story is your latest book, but you've written several and you've often used it as an opportunity to story tell, to share, and to evangelize a little bit as you might say yourself. This time you're reflecting on decades of life and business. What did you see when you took that step back?John Mackey: That's a really good question. What's interesting about writing a book, particularly a book like this, where I got to review almost 50 years of my life and the act of writing itself is a discovery process and it's a creative process. But it also, and if you're doing a memoir, it reconnects things and you see things retrospectively that you didn't see at that time and maybe didn't see until you actually started writing the book. I began to see patterns as I was writing, for example, that I hadn't seen before. One of my takeaways was reflecting back on where things took a bad term for Whole Foods. Back in the 2008 recession, Whole Foods stock dropped 90% and we were trading at three times our operating cash flow. You could have bought our company and paid for it with our own cash in just three years. [laughs]. Needless to say, we were a little worried that we might get taken over, a hostile takeover might come our way, and so we took in some private equity funds from Leonard Green that in the legal agreement, they had the vote with management for certain period of time, so it would act as protection money. They did very well because they made four billion dollars in less than three years on that investment.Dylan Lewis: Wow.John Mackey: Pretty amazing thing. But when we came out of that recession, our stock began to not only recover, but it went up to all-time new highs within just a few years. It was a very heady to watch, having worried that you are going to be taken over to your stock. We were down 90% and we traded onto new highs, got our all-time market capitalization high of about 24 billion. We went from being radically undervalued to arguably radically overvalued in just a few years. But that was the greatest opportunity the company ever had in our history to lower our prices. The competitors were starting to copy us and catch up, and they were taking more and more of our products and they were trying to undercut us in price, and the whole paycheck narrative was out there. We could've put that narrative to bed then if we had just not been less greedy and less euphoric over our double-digit comps and our continued stock going up. We felt like we were unbeatable. But if we'd just been a little humbler and had been lowering our prices, our stock wouldn't gone up so much, so it wouldn't have gotten up to a $24 billion valuation, which arguably was not defensible or sustainable with their current sales and EBITDA that we were producing. We wouldn't have gone up as much, but we would've been able to lower our prices. If we've done that, we probably would very likely still be an independent company today.Dylan Lewis: As is often the case with great stories, there are setbacks along the way. 2008 is one of them that comes up, but in the early days you also have the flood in Austin at your first location. We have the benefit now of knowing Whole Foods as this trailblazer, this category-defining idea, this business that has over 500 locations. It was not that, and it's not that when you start the book. It's safer way. It's a single location in Austin. At what point in that story and in that development do you start to see the opportunity with natural foods blossoming into what it became?John Mackey: I began to see it early on because we could see that there were other small chains like Whole Foods Market, Mrs. Gooch's in Los Angeles, Bread and Circus in Boston, Alfalfa's in Boulder, or Unicorn Village in Florida that were our peers. We were swapping financial information and we created something called The Natural Foods Network which we got together three times a year and shared financial statements and talked about strategies. We had these colleagues and I thought, this is going to grow, this movement catching on all. All the companies were doing well, they are all growing. That was my first inkling. I just thought of Whole Foods, we could be this good Texas company. It wasn't until I took a road trip back in 1996 with my first wife, Mary Kay, and in this road trip, we drove from Austin, we went to LA, and toward Mrs. Gooch's and other stores there, Trader Joe's, they were a very different company than they turned out to be too. But we went to northern California, which is really the birth of the counterculture. It had been famous for the Berkeley co-ops and the Berkeley free speech movement. You had Silicon Valley beginning to burst forth, and you had Marine County, and San Francisco was this very special place. Summer of love, the hippies. But you know what they did, they didn't have any natural foods supermarkets in the Bay Area. Although there were turned to natural food stores, that was the first time I realized, my god, maybe Whole Foods Market, maybe we can open a store here. Maybe we could come to California, into the Bay Area, which we thought was a really crazy idea. That's a big step going from just a few stores in Texas all the way out to the Bay Area. Can we do it? We solicited the votes of our team members. We just said, what state outside of Texas should we go to next? It shouldn't have surprised us. The overwhelming consensus by the team members is that our next state should be Hawaii. [laughs].Dylan Lewis: Was that market opportunity or was that lifestyle opportunity?John Mackey: I don't think they were thinking in terms of a business opportunity. They're thinking about where they would like to live and if you open a store in Hawaii, count me down as moving out there. [laughs] That was too far a step for us, although we've been very successful in Hawaii ever since we went there. The only state we don't have to compete against Trader Joe's because they've never gone to Hawaii. [laughs] California was Number 2 on that list, so we went to California next. We went to the Bay Area, Palo Alto, and then Berkeley, then Mill Valley, then San Francisco. I think now we have about 50 or 60 stores in the Bay Area. It's one of our best overall market areas. That enabled us to think, you know what? If we can be successful here, we can be a national company. Then we started working on that dream.Dylan Lewis: You get into the growth strategy with Whole Foods in the process of opening new locations, acquiring new locations, and also some of the companies that you mentioned, some of those colleagues/peers, not quite competitors wind up becoming part of the Whole Foods footprint. There's this opportunity and this recognition, I think, that you need to seize this and move quickly. What did you feel some of the lessons learned were when you were expanding that footprint?John Mackey: One lesson was we were the first ones to take venture capital in, we were the first ones to raise serious capital, first one to do an IPO, and our peers were not. They were just thinking small and Whole Foods was beginning to think larger. Once we did our IPO, then we were a platform and also an exit strategy for the other entrepreneurs. They could sell their companies, they could get liquid without having to sell it to somebody they didn't want to because we were friends, they could sell it to us. They trusted us to manage their business as well, and they got rich, they got big paydays, and they could ride off in the sunset and live the rest of their lives doing whatever they wanted to do. They were free. That was a win-win-win. But it also gave us platforms. It gave us what we call territory and talent. We got new territory as a base that we could begin to expand from. The hardest thing is to get the first base established because, where are workers going to come from? Where's the talent going to come from? If you can acquire a platform that already exist, you've already got talent, you've already got some territory, and you can take that and put our operational expertise into it and then grow it from there. We bought first Wellspring Grocery in North Carolina because they were friends of ours. Then Bread and Circus in Boston. Then then Mrs. Gooch's in LA. Then we went down into Florida and we pretty much eventually bought almost everybody that had been connected into the Natural Food Network. That was a big takeaway, big lesson, that starting a new region was difficult and expensive and you had to incent people to move and you still couldn't get that many people. But if you could buy something that was already there and combine the intellectual capital together, and you took an attitude of humility. We don't know everything, the information and knowledge they have can enrich the whole rest of the company. We had this attitude of this is what we know, what do you know? Let's compare notes. Let's get best practices. We were learning and growing together, rather than, hey, we must be better and smarter than you because we bought you, you didn't buy us. Instead, we had an attitude of, what can you teach us? What do you see that we're not doing well that we could do better. That attitude really helped Whole Foods Market evolve at a quicker pace.Dylan Lewis: You mentioned the venture capitalists and there's a little bit of a double-edged sword there. Helping with some of the growth, but then also inviting people in who maybe have different ideas, different incentives, different timelines for things. What was your experience like navigating that?John Mackey: I had a love-hate relationship with the VCs because I came up with a name that I think catches it pretty well. The venture capitalists were like hitchhikers with credit cards. [laughs] Meaning they got into the Whole Foods car, and as long as we took them to where they wanted to get to, which was either selling the company or doing an IPO, and we did an IPO, so that they can get a really nice return for their investors, which we delivered, they would help pay for the gas. They'd help us with money to let Whole Foods deliver on the promises that we made to them. However, if we were unable to deliver on those promises, then there is a tendency for venture capitalists to hijack the car.John Mackey: Hire a new driver, generally with a MBA from Harvard or Wharton or Stanford, and throw you out on the entrepreneur on the side of the road. We were lucky because we did get those hitchhikers with credit cards to where they wanted to get to. They never took over the car, and so it had very happy ending. I have lots of other entrepreneurial friends who got kicked out of the car and thrown on the side of the road so what I'm talking about is not hyperbole, it happens all the timeDylan Lewis: You like to focus on mission and purpose, and it comes up in the book quite a bit. It is a very difficult thing to assess as an outsider for a business. It's not something you can really get a feel for as an insider. But we're investors and we're looking at other companies very often. Do you have any tips for really getting to the nut of that?John Mackey: I do. First of all, every company is going to put up some mission statement. It's just now something you do. One thing you can ask is where does the mission statement come from? Did it come from a consultant that the company hired to produce a mission statement? Did it come from outside? Was it externally created or was it something that emerged from within the company itself? The ones that emerged from within the company are really authentic higher purposes, because in a lot of ways, the entrepreneur is oftentimes driven by a higher purpose, but it's tacit for them. So many entrepreneurs are very intuitive driven people, and they don't always communicate and make explicit what their own potential higher purpose or what they think the business is. A consultant can come in and help tease that out. That would still be an internal higher purpose because it's just being teased out as opposed to. Here's what I think are higher purpose should be, having talked to a few people. If the purpose is coming from within and you're making what's been tacit explicit, and the entrepreneur aligns with it, then you really haven't authentic higher purpose. I've also found that you can often tell if the higher purposes frequently don't last past the founder, to be honest. Once you begin to professionalize the management team, the professionals come in and they bring a lot of intelligence and sometimes a lot of business experience, but they don't necessarily bring the passion in. They're aligned with their career and their resume. Their loyalty is more to that necessarily than the business.Dylan Lewis: As you wrap your book, you give us your recipe for your favorite smoothie. Half veggies; spinach, broccoli, bok choy, radishes. Half fruit; berries, banana, seasonal fruits, dates. Any other Mackey favorite recipes you can share?John Mackey: For smoothies or for food in general?Dylan Lewis: Food in general.John Mackey: One of my go-to, easy to make food which is really nutritious is, first you need an Instant Pot, which is the greatest thing because you got the pressure cooker on that. First you've got to soak your beans. This is the only preparation. Soak the beans, but you can do a quick soak, putting them to boiling for a minute and turn it off and then throw out the water after an hour, then you can drain you beans or quick soak, or you can do it overnight and they'll be even better soaked. It starts with beans, some bean of your choice, and then lots of root vegetables. I usually add soaked carrots, sweet potatoes, regular potatoes, other vegetables, bok choy, broccoli, onions, garlic. It's a stew. It's a bean and vegetables stew. Then you can go Mexican with your seasonings, with a little bit of chili pepper in that to get a little bit of chili there, or you can go Indian with a little turmeric and garam masala and black mustard seeds. There are different ways you can go in terms of flavoring it up. Then for me, I'll make up the whole Instant Pot with that bean stew and I can make tacos out of that, once I have that there, I can make tacos. You add cilantro and avocados and tomatoes and salsa. If you're going Indian, you can put a dosa out there. That sources this foundation food, or you can just have it as a stew, which is the easiest thing to do. Between smoothies and a good bean and vegetables stew, I'm eating well for a few nights of the week for sure.Dylan Lewis: Listeners, you can get John Mackey's book, The Whole Story, beginning May 21st, in addition to his smoothie recipe. It's also got his reflections on the Amazon acquisition of Whole Foods and details on his next chapter, Love.Life, a holistic health and wellness club opening its doors in LA this summer. Coming up after the break, we've got stocks on our radar. Stay right here. You're listening to Motley Fool Money. As always, people on the program may have interest in the stocks they talk about, and the Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell anything based solely on what you hear. I'm Dylan Lewis, joined again by Matt Argersinger and Jason Moser. We're going to jump right into stocks on our radar this week. As always, our man behind the glass, Dan Boyd, is going to hit you with a question. Matt, you're up first. What are you looking at this week?Matthew Argersinger: All right. Back to T. Rowe Price, ticker TROW. I did not know this, but according to the Sovereign Wealth Institute, very reputable organization.Dylan Lewis: Sounds sure serious.Matthew Argersinger: T. Rowe Price is the ninth largest asset management firm in the world. I bet not many investors know that, including me. It ended the first quarter with 1.54 trillion in assets under management. That's up about 200 billion year-over-year. Of course, all of that was driven by a really strong stock market over the last 12 months, as we know, which drove asset values higher. T. Rowe did see $8 billion in net client outflows. Those are clients who actively withdrew money out of T. Rowes funds, but that's very small and it's roughly half of what the net outflows were a year ago. What does a big AUM increase like that do for T. Rowes business? A lot. If you look at their net effective rate which held steady, they had a 13.8% increase in net revenue in the quarter, 22% increase in net operating profits, a lot of operating leverage in this business, generated 535 million in free cash flow, paid out 297 million in dividends, which I love, and made 83 million in share repurchases. I look at this business, assets are growing, long-term performance of other funds and strategies, very strong. The stock trades for about 13 times forward earnings pays a 4.3% dividend, and I think Dan likes dividends too, so I like what I'm seeing now with T. Rowe.Dylan Lewis: Dan, interested at all in that dividend and shares of T. Rowe Price? Ticker TROW.Dan Boyd: Yeah, sure. But I've started to notice something, Dylan. [laughs] I've started to notice a little bit about Matt's investing style, and it seems to be real estate and companies that already have a large amount of money on hand.Dylan Lewis: Hey, what's not to like about that? I don't think he's trying to make it too hard for himself.Matthew Argersinger: That's right.Dylan Lewis: There are no style points. [laughs] Take the easy wins where you can get them. Jason, what's on your radar this week?Jason Moser: Taking a closer look at Shopify, ticker is SHOP, and Shopify is one of the leaders in the e-commerce space with its ecosystem of tools and services that help businesses of all sizes with their e-commerce presence. The company recently reported quarterly results and it was a great quarter. The revenue, 1.9 billion, was up 29% after they adjusted for the sale of the logistics business. Some other KPIs, key performance indicators, that look good, gross merchandise volume up 23%, gross payments volume up 31.6%, and subscription solutions were up 34%. The business is doing very well. The kicker here was guidance. They guided for revenue growth in the coming quarter, more in the mid teens, and for a company that's just continuing to chalk up these 25-30 percent rates. That's a problem. That's why the stock sold off. But I can't help but wonder if maybe there's an opportunity here.Dylan Lewis: Dan, a question or perhaps a comment on Shopify?Dan Boyd: Shopify is a Canadian company, headquartered in Ottawa, Canada, and in a couple of weeks, I'm going to go to Ottawa, Canada for the first time. I'm not going to go to the headquarters, but I'm just, I guess excited to go to Canada.Dylan Lewis: You'll be near Shopify, I guess Dan.Dan Boyd: Sure. I will be in existence near where Shopify also exists.Dylan Lewis: Dan, which one's going on your watch list this week?Dan Boyd: Let's go Canada, Shopify.Dylan Lewis: Alright, that is going to do it for this week's Motley Fool Money radio show.

dow 40k and the latest stock in berkshire s portfolio  this week s motley fool money radio show starts now  it s the motley fool money radio show  i m dylan lewis joining me in the studio  motley fool senior analyst matt argersinger and jason moser  gentlemen  great to have you both here  we ve got the stock buffett s been secretly buying the whole story from whole foods co founder john mackey and of course  stocks on our radar  we re going to start out this week checking in on the market  this week  the dow kissed 40k for the first time ever  matt  not able to hold it there  but we will note a milestone  when a milestone comes matthew argersinger  it is a milestone and i know it s a meaningless number  who cares  dow 39 000  40 000  but it s it s a big round number  so i think we should celebrate it and we re in the middle of a bull market  i have some interesting facts and a few questions for you guys regarding the dow jones industrial average  which made its debut in may of 1896  its first computed average was 41 points across 100 for the first time on january 12th  1906  jmo  do you know the largest company in the dow  was on january 12th  1906 story continuesjason moser  i don t  but i m going to take a stab at the dark and just say general electric matthew argersinger  the total  dylan dylan lewis  i m going to say oil  standard oil matthew argersinger  you got what you guys are in the general area  it s it was us steel  dow s largest company  the dow first crossed with 1 000 big number on november 14th  972  sixty years later  what was the largest company on january or starting november 14  1972 dylan lewis  in the dow matthew argersinger  in the dow dylan lewis  i m going to take his guess from before and say general electric jason moser  yeah  i m going to keep on saying general electric things dylan lewis  well  you re going to keep on matthew argersinger  it was ibm in 1972  dow first cross 10 000 in the middle of the com boom  march 29  1999  what was the largest company in the dow on that date jason moser  cisco  it s a great guess  i m going to go back to ibm  the previous matthew argersinger  general electric jason moser  should have stuck with it matthew argersinger  interestingly enough  microsoft was the biggest company by market cap in march 29  1999  but it was not in the dow  it didn t get into the dow until november of that year  at that time  ge was still the biggest  dow first cross 20 000 on january 25  2017  not long time ago  what was the biggest company in the dow on january 25  2017 jason moser  i feel like apple was in there by them  i don t remember when they got added  i can t remember the day  but i m going to guess apple because they feel like they were in there by then dylan lewis  i m going to follow jmo on that one matthew argersinger  you guys are right jason moser  finally got it matthew argersinger  apple was added in 2015  so yes  on january 25  2017  it was the biggest dow component  by market cap  dow first cross a 30 000 on november 24  2020  just three plus years later  what was the biggest company on november 24  2020 dylan lewis  amazon jason moser  i don t know if amazon was in there at that point  i m going to guess home depot matthew argersinger  no  but it was apple still  which was much bigger than of course it s still the biggest  now  the dow first cross 40 000 didn t hold it but cross 40 000 for the first time on thursday  what is the biggest company in the dow right now jason moser  is microsoft in the dow  i don t think microsoft is in the dow  is it dylan lewis  i don t think so  i m going to go to amazon jason moser  it s apple  is it apple  it has to be matthew argersinger  it s microsoft  it was as this out back in 1999 and now it didn t  it was not the biggest company for a long time  but of course  it just recently went past apple  it s bigger than a bigger than apple by about 5   it is the biggest dow component right now dylan lewis  what i like about what matt he s doing here because one of the things with the dow is  it s had this reputation for so long of being old  stodgy  outdated industrials  boring and it s not really up to speed with our tech driven world today  but i think that s one point to note with the dow is that it s evolved  it s become a little bit more relevant to the modern day economy in those days where we issued it  i think those days are over  we can look at it with a little bit more credibility today because of its components jason moser  i think a lot of people will bemoan the fact that it s still a price weighted index which feels outdated  it s only 30 components  31 i think because anyway  because it s a company that has two classes  but either way  it is still the most quoted index i think around the world  if you watch any kind of news  especially for not watching businesses we watch be rushing regular mainstream news  what s the number they always go to  it s always the dow  until the dow was up 300 points and dow is not this  it s still very relevant dylan lewis  can you make a point with the price weighted versus the s p  which is market cap weighted for two very different perspectives matthew argersinger  don t sleep on the dow  i think is the takeaway  also maybe we need to study up a little bit on the dow components  jason  i will put this wellness labor  all this data by the way  i pulled from nai chatbot  i think it s i fact check some of it so i think it s right  but don t quote me if you re a dow historian listening to this radio show right now dylan lewis  we ve got smartly ai smart talk coming up in the second segment on today s show  but i wanted to take us to a dow company that did not come up in that discussion  that s walmart very much doing its part to lift the dow this week and help it touch that 40k number  shares up 7  to a new all time high  jason  that s because company earnings results this week look pretty strong jason moser  they did  this is an environment where walmart should shine  the consumer is becoming a bit more discerning regarding prices and what they re spending  we ve seen that just all over earning season in walmart s value tilt  i think  should prove to be a big driver for the company in the coming quarters  when you look at the results  revenue growth 5 8  in constant currency  walmart  u s  delivered better than expected growth those comps sales were up 3 8   they ultimately saw their adjusted operating profit up 13   doing a great job of bringing that down to the bottom line  you see operating leverage with companies like these that really do a good job of monetizing that fixed cost base  some encouraging statistics  e commerce up 21   the advertising business  you got to dig in a little bit to get some context there  but the global advertising business grew 24   this is becoming a little bit more of an ad play as well  you d like to see them diversify that revenue stream inventories in good shape  i think the most interesting part  given their presence in grocery  grocery remains a big part  they ve introduced a new private label brand called better goods  very much focused on the value side of things  seventy percent of better goods items are priced under  5  that is sure to attract the grocery consumer dylan lewis  i look at some of the market conditions here  jason and you mentioned  consumers trading down groceries are huge part of this company s business  some of these private label initiatives bringing some things that you can only get from walmart  seems to me like they are trying to create a longer term relationship with some of these consumers that are trying them  maybe trading down into them and then keeping them as customers beyond this more pinched period matthew argersinger  there s just no question and you ve seen examples throughout history of companies that have done this very well  i think whole foods stands out as one they ve done with the 365 brand  look at a company like trader joe s  not a publicly traded company  but something very similar in that line  companies have just done a very good job of building costco with kirkland  another great one  it makes absolute sense for walmart to try to build that identification a little bit with this better goods brand and i suspect it ll do well dylan lewis  less glamorous results this week from home depot  earnings ahead of expectations  revenue lagged matt  both down year over year matthew argersinger  just not a lot to build on here  dylan  see what i did there  comparable store sales continued to decline year over year down 2 8  in the quarter  it was tough to see both customer transactions and average ticket size  lower  management said there was a delayed start to spring  can spring actually get delayed dylan lewis  it feel like it s being delayed here  certainly been getting the rain matthew argersinger  that s the weather argument  i get it  they also said  of course  and they ve been saying this for several quarters now and there s a big ticket items continued to be slow  that s has a lot to do with the tight housing market with high mortgage rates  just not a lot of movement in the existing home side  which is keeping renovations down  a couple of things i did like what they had to say  which is management  they did reaffirm full year guidance  they didn t reduce it like they have been doing  i like that ceo ted decker and team  they re really moving hard and fast into that pro segment  really trying to grow home depot s market share there  they acquired srs distribution  which is a big distributor to professional customers  primarily who do work in roofing  landscaping and pool work  slow period right now for home depot  i d like the investments they re making  i think when the housing market does finally turnaround  they re going to be in a pretty good position dylan lewis  we re just saying walmart  huge beneficiary of consumers trading down  i thought was really interesting  richard mcphail  cfo of home depot  saying they are not seeing customers trading down and they are not seeing people move to cheaper power tools  cheaper appliances and they are deferring those purchases  do you feel like there is probably some pent up demand for home depot products once we get to a better consumer environment matthew argersinger  absolutely  i think that s the case  i think it s all about really getting this existing home market unstuck  i agree  by the way  power tools  they get old over time  i think there is a lot of pent up demand there probably right now jason moser  i think he s exactly right  when you start moving  you buy a new house rented a new place  home depot and they re built  those are the first place is you go  when this thing loosens up a little bit  i suspect we ll see those transaction and that traffic number  those singles to start rising again dylan lewis  coming up after the break  we ve got dives into ai demos from google and openai and berkshire s latest buy  stay right here  this is motley fool money ricky mulvey  ricky mulvey with motley fool money here to tell you about a vehicle that is redefining sporting luxury  the range rover sport  the first thing i noticed when i sat down in the driver s seat that i felt like i was in a cockpit up off the ground and focused interior that promotes exhilarating driver engagement  i also really appreciated the overhead 360 degree camera view that let me know exactly where i was going  zoe s backing out of the parking space  one for a drive in the range rover sport out in littleton  colorado  tested the accelerator just a little bit  felt the performance and agility  it s an instinctive drive with engaging on road dynamics and effortless composure  put it plainly  the range rover sport is powerful  it s also quiet  uncomfortable  advanced cabin technologies such as active noise cancellation and cabin air purification  offer new levels of comfort and refinement  the third generation range rover sport  is the most desirable  advanced and dynamically capable yet  i would like to invite you to visit landroverusa com to learn more about the range rover sport dylan lewis  welcome back to motley fool money  i m dylan lewis here in studio with matt argersinger and jason moser  guys  berkshire s annual meeting was a few weeks ago  but investors didn t quite get everything that was on warren buffett s mind  this week 13f filing out saying what berkshire has been buying and selling  and we have ourselves a new buffett stock  jason berkshire disclosed  it s been building a position in chubb  a property casualty insurer  does this surprise you at all as buffett stock jason moser  no  not even a little bit  this seems right up his alley  i mean  i m not even surprised really at the size of the investment of  6 8 billion tag is what i read  this makes a lot of sense  it feels like buffett is just channeling as is alexander peter lynch buy what you know  you listen to him  he said it  property casualty insurance provides the core of berkshire s well being and growth  chubb is one of the largest players in that market  it makes perfect sense for berkshire and for buffett to go ahead and make that investment there  chubb itself  it s got a long history  it s a company that has performed very well over time  i was looking at the returns on the stock  over the last ten years  the total return on chubb is up almost 220  and outperforming the market nicely  it s got a good track record there  then  if i recall correctly this stake  he started building the stake in the back half of 2023  just looking at 2023 in chubb s 10 k  they quoted 2023 as an exceptional year  double digit premium growth and they talked about a p c property and casualty combined ratio of 86 5   which is impressive  now for those who aren t aware  the combined ratio is it s a popular metric in the insurance world  it s ultimately the incurred losses plus expenses divided by the earned premium revenue  you want to see that number below 100   below 100 is good  eighty six and a half percent obviously well below 100  you look at other companies like markel company that we follow here  they ve done a very good job through the years of keeping that combined ratio in pretty good shape  but he just  he bought a good performer in what is obviously a very crucial market in something that he knows very well  it makes lot of sense  matt  a lot of speculation here because the acc had granted buffett a confidentiality exemption in q4 for their 13f as they were building up this position  certainly a lot of investors following buffett into chubb shares were up seven percent this week on the news  what do you see when you look at the business matthew argersinger  i m surprised and not surprised because i think one of the bedding favorites was charles schwab  a lot of investors we re talking about  but you re right  for everything that jason said  this makes a ton of sense and i can understand why buffett wanted keep this one under wraps  it s hard  it s hard for berkshire to build a meaningful position in anything these days  six and a half billion dollar position takes time  i can see why he wanted to do that because chubb is trading at a pretty good valuation  it s 11 times earnings  pays a nice dividend  that s been growing and so had that been revealed earlier  i can imagine that berkshire buffet wouldn t have gotten the price  that they ve gotten in the stock dylan lewis  price would have creeped up just a little bit matthew argersinger  i think so  it has dylan lewis  people tend to pay attention when warren buffett is buying  people also paying attention when warren buffett is selling  i think one of the other things i noticed in the 13f was buffett is a net seller of stocks for the quarter  jason  any surprises there for you jason moser  that is a little bit of a surprise  he talks often about being net buyers  that s something we espouse here  trying to accumulate that stuff over time  but the flip side of that is you re doing it for something  eventually you get to an age where you want to reap those benefits  and so you got to sell  to be able to reap those benefits  now  i m not saying that s exactly what s going on here  i think what they got fully out of the paramount position  which was well loser  that happens  but that was a pretty big position  i think they took close to a  2 billion loss on that investment  we know that he trimmed a decent bit of apple  i m starting to wonder if i think that might ve been prudent move  you start to look at apple these days and the way they re operating in this ai environment  that s the company that you just don t hear a whole heck of a lot from  you are hearing from microsoft and alphabet and chat  openai and whatnot and apple just seems to be on the back burner there  now  so maybe he saw the valuation and apple and the size of his stake incited  determined that position was worth dylan lewis  i think one of the things that does give people a little bit of pause when they see buffett selling is there s no shortage of cash when it comes to berkshire  i have to ask the question  matt  he s not freeing up money to buy something else  he s got the money on that matthew argersinger  that s what i was just going to say  he s up to 189 billion now in cash and short term securities  that s just the highest it s ever been  and so is above  i have to say at this point  i think buffett never vocally or verbally makes a morphic call  but i just feel like he s making a little bit of a call here  almost 200 billion in cash  a net seller of stocks  maybe he s just not finding a lot of value right now and that s worth thinking about dylan lewis  if investors are following chubb  following berkshire into chubb  maybe also put some cash on the side  create some opportunities for yourself to buy some things down the road matthew argersinger  maybe berkshire needs to think about instituting a dividend right there with all of that cash  with that awesome portfolio  with that tremendous operating model  i keep wondering if we re not going to see that come to fruition here over the course of the next year jason moser  unfortunately  it s going to be greg abel s call  will see  you asked me you probably at least a few years now  hopefully dylan lewis  a big week in the world of ai  new demos out from alphabet s google and openai  jason  i want to start with google s io event because the narrative around this company has generally been missteps and late to the game  we saw some pretty impressive stuff this week jason moser  we did  i think that s very well said  looking at everything that s been going on in ai  and there were these questions as to whether google s model is being disrupted and where they making the investments that were needed  there was a great blog post this week from liz reid  the head of google search  it really  it dug into a lot of what google is doing in search  particularly with this ai overviews product  which is ultimately just its ai organized results pages  one of the concerns in regard to google and ai and how they will incorporate this  would it cannibalize their business  it seems like they saw round that corner and have come up with a way to where they might be able to avoid that in a quote from this blog posts that i just think it s important to read  she said  i quote   with ai overviews  people are visiting a greater diversity of websites for help with more complex questions  we see that the links included in ai overviews get more clicks than if the page had appeared as a traditional web listing for that query   i think that is a very positive development that may have come up with a way to essentially enhance their search  make it better with ai without necessarily disrupting or cannibalizing it dylan lewis  one of the things i like about what we re seeing from google and the developments from google is they are user facing  they are immediately brought into these products that people are already familiar with  i think it maybe starts to quell some of those fears about how does this get incorporated into the business in a way that s meaningful  we also had updates from openai  some fresh demos out this week  they are kind of in their own little garden a little bit  they aren t as incorporated into a visible products  so you have to be a user here  but jason  one of the things that really jumped out to me was the translation capabilities and just the ability of their product to make sense of things that aren t texts  moving beyond simple text jason moser  i m sure it s going to take some time to really nail this down and get it to where it is  it is fail safe  but i think gpt 4o  i watch some of those videos in the video interaction with this personal assistant  you re now talking about interacting with this personal assistant on your phone and that assistant being able to recognize the world around you  seeing you and seeing what you re wearing and what you re doing  this is a big step forward  we ve seen what these ai models they do a very good job of recognizing and processing text  video is that next leap forward  it sounds like they re well on their way dylan lewis  it always feels like there are steps to those aha moments for me and this felt like a big step  i agree  jason moser and matt argersinger  fellows  we re going to see you guys a little bit later in the show  up next  we ve got one of the giants in groceries  talking through growing a retail concept  stay right here  you re listening to motley fool money dylan lewis  welcome back to motley fool money  i m dylan lewis  each week with our interviews  we look to borrow the brains of someone that can make us a little bit smarter about the world of business and better investors and shareholders  this week  i caught up with whole foods co founder and ceo john mackey about his latest book  the whole story  mackey talked me through lessons learned in growing store footprint and how to evaluate a company s mission and management from the outside  the whole story is your latest book  but you ve written several and you ve often used it as an opportunity to story tell  to share  and to evangelize a little bit as you might say yourself  this time you re reflecting on decades of life and business  what did you see when you took that step back john mackey  that s a really good question  what s interesting about writing a book  particularly a book like this  where i got to review almost 50 years of my life and the act of writing itself is a discovery process and it s a creative process  but it also  and if you re doing a memoir  it reconnects things and you see things retrospectively that you didn t see at that time and maybe didn t see until you actually started writing the book  i began to see patterns as i was writing  for example  that i hadn t seen before  one of my takeaways was reflecting back on where things took a bad term for whole foods  back in the 2008 recession  whole foods stock dropped 90  and we were trading at three times our operating cash flow  you could have bought our company and paid for it with our own cash in just three years   laughs   needless to say  we were a little worried that we might get taken over  a hostile takeover might come our way  and so we took in some private equity funds from leonard green that in the legal agreement  they had the vote with management for certain period of time  so it would act as protection money  they did very well because they made four billion dollars in less than three years on that investment dylan lewis  wow john mackey  pretty amazing thing  but when we came out of that recession  our stock began to not only recover  but it went up to all time new highs within just a few years  it was a very heady to watch  having worried that you are going to be taken over to your stock  we were down 90  and we traded onto new highs  got our all time market capitalization high of about 24 billion  we went from being radically undervalued to arguably radically overvalued in just a few years  but that was the greatest opportunity the company ever had in our history to lower our prices  the competitors were starting to copy us and catch up  and they were taking more and more of our products and they were trying to undercut us in price  and the whole paycheck narrative was out there  we could ve put that narrative to bed then if we had just not been less greedy and less euphoric over our double digit comps and our continued stock going up  we felt like we were unbeatable  but if we d just been a little humbler and had been lowering our prices  our stock wouldn t gone up so much  so it wouldn t have gotten up to a  24 billion valuation  which arguably was not defensible or sustainable with their current sales and ebitda that we were producing  we wouldn t have gone up as much  but we would ve been able to lower our prices  if we ve done that  we probably would very likely still be an independent company today dylan lewis  as is often the case with great stories  there are setbacks along the way  2008 is one of them that comes up  but in the early days you also have the flood in austin at your first location  we have the benefit now of knowing whole foods as this trailblazer  this category defining idea  this business that has over 500 locations  it was not that  and it s not that when you start the book  it s safer way  it s a single location in austin  at what point in that story and in that development do you start to see the opportunity with natural foods blossoming into what it became john mackey  i began to see it early on because we could see that there were other small chains like whole foods market  mrs  gooch s in los angeles  bread and circus in boston  alfalfa s in boulder  or unicorn village in florida that were our peers  we were swapping financial information and we created something called the natural foods network which we got together three times a year and shared financial statements and talked about strategies  we had these colleagues and i thought  this is going to grow  this movement catching on all  all the companies were doing well  they are all growing  that was my first inkling  i just thought of whole foods  we could be this good texas company  it wasn t until i took a road trip back in 1996 with my first wife  mary kay  and in this road trip  we drove from austin  we went to la  and toward mrs  gooch s and other stores there  trader joe s  they were a very different company than they turned out to be too  but we went to northern california  which is really the birth of the counterculture  it had been famous for the berkeley co ops and the berkeley free speech movement  you had silicon valley beginning to burst forth  and you had marine county  and san francisco was this very special place  summer of love  the hippies  but you know what they did  they didn t have any natural foods supermarkets in the bay area  although there were turned to natural food stores  that was the first time i realized  my god  maybe whole foods market  maybe we can open a store here  maybe we could come to california  into the bay area  which we thought was a really crazy idea  that s a big step going from just a few stores in texas all the way out to the bay area  can we do it  we solicited the votes of our team members  we just said  what state outside of texas should we go to next  it shouldn t have surprised us  the overwhelming consensus by the team members is that our next state should be hawaii   laughs  dylan lewis  was that market opportunity or was that lifestyle opportunity john mackey  i don t think they were thinking in terms of a business opportunity  they re thinking about where they would like to live and if you open a store in hawaii  count me down as moving out there   laughs  that was too far a step for us  although we ve been very successful in hawaii ever since we went there  the only state we don t have to compete against trader joe s because they ve never gone to hawaii   laughs  california was number 2 on that list  so we went to california next  we went to the bay area  palo alto  and then berkeley  then mill valley  then san francisco  i think now we have about 50 or 60 stores in the bay area  it s one of our best overall market areas  that enabled us to think  you know what  if we can be successful here  we can be a national company  then we started working on that dream dylan lewis  you get into the growth strategy with whole foods in the process of opening new locations  acquiring new locations  and also some of the companies that you mentioned  some of those colleagues peers  not quite competitors wind up becoming part of the whole foods footprint  there s this opportunity and this recognition  i think  that you need to seize this and move quickly  what did you feel some of the lessons learned were when you were expanding that footprint john mackey  one lesson was we were the first ones to take venture capital in  we were the first ones to raise serious capital  first one to do an ipo  and our peers were not  they were just thinking small and whole foods was beginning to think larger  once we did our ipo  then we were a platform and also an exit strategy for the other entrepreneurs  they could sell their companies  they could get liquid without having to sell it to somebody they didn t want to because we were friends  they could sell it to us  they trusted us to manage their business as well  and they got rich  they got big paydays  and they could ride off in the sunset and live the rest of their lives doing whatever they wanted to do  they were free  that was a win win win  but it also gave us platforms  it gave us what we call territory and talent  we got new territory as a base that we could begin to expand from  the hardest thing is to get the first base established because  where are workers going to come from  where s the talent going to come from  if you can acquire a platform that already exist  you ve already got talent  you ve already got some territory  and you can take that and put our operational expertise into it and then grow it from there  we bought first wellspring grocery in north carolina because they were friends of ours  then bread and circus in boston  then then mrs  gooch s in la  then we went down into florida and we pretty much eventually bought almost everybody that had been connected into the natural food network  that was a big takeaway  big lesson  that starting a new region was difficult and expensive and you had to incent people to move and you still couldn t get that many people  but if you could buy something that was already there and combine the intellectual capital together  and you took an attitude of humility  we don t know everything  the information and knowledge they have can enrich the whole rest of the company  we had this attitude of this is what we know  what do you know  let s compare notes  let s get best practices  we were learning and growing together  rather than  hey  we must be better and smarter than you because we bought you  you didn t buy us  instead  we had an attitude of  what can you teach us  what do you see that we re not doing well that we could do better  that attitude really helped whole foods market evolve at a quicker pace dylan lewis  you mentioned the venture capitalists and there s a little bit of a double edged sword there  helping with some of the growth  but then also inviting people in who maybe have different ideas  different incentives  different timelines for things  what was your experience like navigating that john mackey  i had a love hate relationship with the vcs because i came up with a name that i think catches it pretty well  the venture capitalists were like hitchhikers with credit cards   laughs  meaning they got into the whole foods car  and as long as we took them to where they wanted to get to  which was either selling the company or doing an ipo  and we did an ipo  so that they can get a really nice return for their investors  which we delivered  they would help pay for the gas  they d help us with money to let whole foods deliver on the promises that we made to them  however  if we were unable to deliver on those promises  then there is a tendency for venture capitalists to hijack the car john mackey  hire a new driver  generally with a mba from harvard or wharton or stanford  and throw you out on the entrepreneur on the side of the road  we were lucky because we did get those hitchhikers with credit cards to where they wanted to get to  they never took over the car  and so it had very happy ending  i have lots of other entrepreneurial friends who got kicked out of the car and thrown on the side of the road so what i m talking about is not hyperbole  it happens all the timedylan lewis  you like to focus on mission and purpose  and it comes up in the book quite a bit  it is a very difficult thing to assess as an outsider for a business  it s not something you can really get a feel for as an insider  but we re investors and we re looking at other companies very often  do you have any tips for really getting to the nut of that john mackey  i do  first of all  every company is going to put up some mission statement  it s just now something you do  one thing you can ask is where does the mission statement come from  did it come from a consultant that the company hired to produce a mission statement  did it come from outside  was it externally created or was it something that emerged from within the company itself  the ones that emerged from within the company are really authentic higher purposes  because in a lot of ways  the entrepreneur is oftentimes driven by a higher purpose  but it s tacit for them  so many entrepreneurs are very intuitive driven people  and they don t always communicate and make explicit what their own potential higher purpose or what they think the business is  a consultant can come in and help tease that out  that would still be an internal higher purpose because it s just being teased out as opposed to  here s what i think are higher purpose should be  having talked to a few people  if the purpose is coming from within and you re making what s been tacit explicit  and the entrepreneur aligns with it  then you really haven t authentic higher purpose  i ve also found that you can often tell if the higher purposes frequently don t last past the founder  to be honest  once you begin to professionalize the management team  the professionals come in and they bring a lot of intelligence and sometimes a lot of business experience  but they don t necessarily bring the passion in  they re aligned with their career and their resume  their loyalty is more to that necessarily than the business dylan lewis  as you wrap your book  you give us your recipe for your favorite smoothie  half veggies  spinach  broccoli  bok choy  radishes  half fruit  berries  banana  seasonal fruits  dates  any other mackey favorite recipes you can share john mackey  for smoothies or for food in general dylan lewis  food in general john mackey  one of my go to  easy to make food which is really nutritious is  first you need an instant pot  which is the greatest thing because you got the pressure cooker on that  first you ve got to soak your beans  this is the only preparation  soak the beans  but you can do a quick soak  putting them to boiling for a minute and turn it off and then throw out the water after an hour  then you can drain you beans or quick soak  or you can do it overnight and they ll be even better soaked  it starts with beans  some bean of your choice  and then lots of root vegetables  i usually add soaked carrots  sweet potatoes  regular potatoes  other vegetables  bok choy  broccoli  onions  garlic  it s a stew  it s a bean and vegetables stew  then you can go mexican with your seasonings  with a little bit of chili pepper in that to get a little bit of chili there  or you can go indian with a little turmeric and garam masala and black mustard seeds  there are different ways you can go in terms of flavoring it up  then for me  i ll make up the whole instant pot with that bean stew and i can make tacos out of that  once i have that there  i can make tacos  you add cilantro and avocados and tomatoes and salsa  if you re going indian  you can put a dosa out there  that sources this foundation food  or you can just have it as a stew  which is the easiest thing to do  between smoothies and a good bean and vegetables stew  i m eating well for a few nights of the week for sure dylan lewis  listeners  you can get john mackey s book  the whole story  beginning may 21st  in addition to his smoothie recipe  it s also got his reflections on the amazon acquisition of whole foods and details on his next chapter  love life  a holistic health and wellness club opening its doors in la this summer  coming up after the break  we ve got stocks on our radar  stay right here  you re listening to motley fool money  as always  people on the program may have interest in the stocks they talk about  and the motley fool may have formal recommendations for or against  so don t buy or sell anything based solely on what you hear  i m dylan lewis  joined again by matt argersinger and jason moser  we re going to jump right into stocks on our radar this week  as always  our man behind the glass  dan boyd  is going to hit you with a question  matt  you re up first  what are you looking at this week matthew argersinger  all right  back to t  rowe price  ticker trow  i did not know this  but according to the sovereign wealth institute  very reputable organization dylan lewis  sounds sure serious matthew argersinger  t  rowe price is the ninth largest asset management firm in the world  i bet not many investors know that  including me  it ended the first quarter with 1 54 trillion in assets under management  that s up about 200 billion year over year  of course  all of that was driven by a really strong stock market over the last 12 months  as we know  which drove asset values higher  t  rowe did see  8 billion in net client outflows  those are clients who actively withdrew money out of t  rowes funds  but that s very small and it s roughly half of what the net outflows were a year ago  what does a big aum increase like that do for t  rowes business  a lot  if you look at their net effective rate which held steady  they had a 13 8  increase in net revenue in the quarter  22  increase in net operating profits  a lot of operating leverage in this business  generated 535 million in free cash flow  paid out 297 million in dividends  which i love  and made 83 million in share repurchases  i look at this business  assets are growing  long term performance of other funds and strategies  very strong  the stock trades for about 13 times forward earnings pays a 4 3  dividend  and i think dan likes dividends too  so i like what i m seeing now with t  rowe dylan lewis  dan  interested at all in that dividend and shares of t  rowe price  ticker trow dan boyd  yeah  sure  but i ve started to notice something  dylan   laughs  i ve started to notice a little bit about matt s investing style  and it seems to be real estate and companies that already have a large amount of money on hand dylan lewis  hey  what s not to like about that  i don t think he s trying to make it too hard for himself matthew argersinger  that s right dylan lewis  there are no style points   laughs  take the easy wins where you can get them  jason  what s on your radar this week jason moser  taking a closer look at shopify  ticker is shop  and shopify is one of the leaders in the e commerce space with its ecosystem of tools and services that help businesses of all sizes with their e commerce presence  the company recently reported quarterly results and it was a great quarter  the revenue  1 9 billion  was up 29  after they adjusted for the sale of the logistics business  some other kpis  key performance indicators  that look good  gross merchandise volume up 23   gross payments volume up 31 6   and subscription solutions were up 34   the business is doing very well  the kicker here was guidance  they guided for revenue growth in the coming quarter  more in the mid teens  and for a company that s just continuing to chalk up these 25 30 percent rates  that s a problem  that s why the stock sold off  but i can t help but wonder if maybe there s an opportunity here dylan lewis  dan  a question or perhaps a comment on shopify dan boyd  shopify is a canadian company  headquartered in ottawa  canada  and in a couple of weeks  i m going to go to ottawa  canada for the first time  i m not going to go to the headquarters  but i m just  i guess excited to go to canada dylan lewis  you ll be near shopify  i guess dan dan boyd  sure  i will be in existence near where shopify also exists dylan lewis  dan  which one s going on your watch list this week dan boyd  let s go canada  shopify dylan lewis  alright  that is going to do it for this week s motley fool money radio show  the show is mixed by dan boyd  i m dylan lewis  thanks for

                        "Shopify (SHOP) Shares Skyrocket, What You Need To KnowWhat Happened:Shares of e-commerce software platform Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) jumped 5.4% in the morning session after Goldman Sachs analyst upgraded the stock's rating from Neutral to Buy and raised the price target from $64 to $74. The new price target represents a 25% premium from where shares traded when the upgrade was announced. The analyst added, \"Given Shopify's significant technology moat in eCommerce software and share gain across eCommerce cycles, we believe these investments will drive more durable revenue growth at scale.\" After the initial pop the shares cooled down to $58.64, up 2.8% from previous close.Is now the time to buy Shopify? Access our full analysis report here, it's free.What is the market telling us:Shopify's shares are very volatile and over the last year have had 18 moves greater than 5%. In context of that, today's move is indicating the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.The previous big move we wrote about was 14 days ago, when the stock dropped 19.9% on the news that the company reported first-quarter results and provided revenue guidance for Q2, which implied a growth deceleration. In Q2'2024, Shopify expects revenue to grow at high-teens percentage rate on a year-over-year basis. This is a significant decline compared to the low-twenties percentage growth recorded in Q1. On a more positive note, GMV (gross merchandise value) and revenue both came in narrowly ahead of analysts' estimates during the quarter. It's noteworthy that the magnitude of these beats was smaller and less convincing than previous quarters. EPS did beat by a more convincing margin. Gross margin improved while the business continued to generate positive cash flow. Overall, it was a mixed quarter for the company, with the market likely worried about the weaker growth forecast for a company trading at a fairly lofty valuation.Shopify is down 20.7% since the beginning of the year, and at $58.64 per share it is trading 35.4% below its 52-week high of $90.72 from February 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Shopify's shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $2,099.Unless you’ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) semiconductor stock benefitting from the rise of AI.

You're listening to Motley Fool Money. I'm Ricky Mulvey, joined today by Jim Gillies. Jim, good to see you.Jim Gillies: Good to be seen, Ricky.Ricky Mulvey: When Hindenburg Research goes after a company, a lot of people pay attention, but I'm not going to assume all of the listeners are familiar with this short-selling firm and why we would care so much about it. Why is Hindenburg particularly worth listening to? Why is it worth investors attention?Jim Gillies: Well, as with anything in the investing space, I suppose, you are what your record says you are, and Hindenburg's record says they're pretty good at this shorting thing. I'll give you a couple, they went after Nikola, the hydrogen-based electric car manufacturer/fraud, they went after them I think in late 2020. The stock's down about 97% since then they went after Clover Health in February I believe of 2021. I think that stock's down about 95 plus percent since then. Believe me, there are some shorts who are clown shows and should be ignored or preferably laughed at. I don't think Hindenburg is one. I have a lot of respect for what Hindenburg has done. I may or may not agree with them, but just like other shorts who I like, Muddy Waters, Carson Block, he's done some very good work, of course, Jim Chanos, he's the godfather of shorts for my generation of investors. You don't have to agree with all of their calls, I certainly don't. But I think it's always worthwhile paying attention to what they're saying because I think they can often unearth some things that are worth you knowing at least to say, no, that's not right. No, that's incorrect, or no, this is serious. This is something I should look at. I'm not someone that demonizes short sellers, I actually think they're a valuable part of the market environment.Story continuesRicky Mulvey: Let's talk about what Hindenburg is saying about Axos Financial. The original bull case for the company is basically a digital bank that's really good investing deposits in a less risky way, and it seems that what Hindenburg is saying at a large level is actually this bank is taking on a ton of risk in commercial real estate and a lot of their loans might not be paid back by the borrowers they gave money to.Jim Gillies: That's a risk of banking that you've made poor loans that do not get repaid.Ricky Mulvey: It's looking a lot at the commercial real estate exposure. This is where the spotlight is going. \"Axos total commercial real estate exposure has ballooned to 53% of total net loans.\" Points out that it's peers are closer to about 16%. A lot of these loans are in the New York area where commercial real estate has had a bit of a change in valuation. There are some highlights in the report, Jim. I'm going to give you mine first, and then I'd like to hear what your highlights are. They're talking about one loan in particular. \"One reason most banks don't lend up to 97.5 million to individuals with multiple indictments and documented mob ties is that even if things go well, it can be difficult to get your money back. This is made even more challenging when things go poorly as seems to be the case with this property.\" That's pretty juicy. Anything in this report, any of the bullet points, you have a litany of them. Any of the bullet points, claims, takes that really stand out to you.Jim Gillies: Well, that one actually. That was the one that stuck out to me. Mainly because you got to love something talking about multiple indictments and mob ties. But here's the thing when it comes to short reports. Again, I have all the time in the world for Hindenburg. I will absolutely listen to Hindenburg when they come for some of my companies and by the way, this is a recommendation of mine and the service I run here in James, Canada. But I'm perfectly fine with them coming out here. What I want to impress upon the listener is short reports are designed to scare you. They are designed to perhaps invoke an emotional reaction because a short, of course, makes money when the stock goes down and if you read the disclosure here, Hindenburg is short the shares. They have borrowed shares from other investors, they have sold them into the market, and they will be looking to buy them back at a later date maybe even as early as today, probably not, but they were looking to buy them back at a lower price at a later date and pocket the difference and call it a profit. Short reports are designed to scare you and sometimes some of the points that they make may be a little dressed up to be somewhat histrionic or convey a sense of just urgency and scariness that may or may not be there. The example I'll give you is in October of 2017, a short called Citron Research run by a gentleman named Andrew Left, who I do not hold in the esteem with which I hold Hindenburg, I will put that out there and let you draw your own conclusions.He came out with a short report on Shopify, which at the time I think was about $10 Canadian ballpark. The split adjusted somewhere $10 and $15 Canadian. It was histrionics, it was basically saying that they would have to be shut down by regulators and authorities. If you actually went through and thought it through, a lot of their bullet points that they made, which were all scary just like Hindenburg's ones are here, didn't hold a lot of water. Like talking about, well, they was in the referral business, so people could get referrals for starting a new business on Shopify. You get $2,500 for starting a referral blah. You could get these finders fees, but you can only get them for people that started giant businesses on Shopify. You and I starting a sock reselling business on Shopify wouldn't have gotten a penny, but if you brought Nestle on board, you'd get a $2,500 finder's fee for bringing a company the size and heft of Nestle onto the Shopify platform. But I'm going to give you a couple of things here. An investor, when they hear about a short report, first off, the best thing you can do is to do nothing. Take your time, you're not going to get out in front of the people panic selling because of the short report. The stock, I think it opened up down 15% today. As we speak, it's down about 7-8%. It's already starting to rebound. Second off, forget what Hindenburg has done, but if I tell you here, if I tell you that in the most recent quarter, Axos boosted net income by 38%, boosted earnings per share by 44.5% because they have been buying back their own stock. Their net interest margin, a very important metric for banks was 4.87% up from 4.42 a year before. To put that into context, being Canadian, I watched the big Canadian banks a lot. Again, Axos financial, formerly known as Bank of Internet, 4.87% net interest margin. In Canada, the big banks which are all beautifully solid and whatever, the average was up 1.74%. Their capital looked good, their book value was up 24%. They're actively repurching. They had a bunch of cash well above the uninsured deposits. Their deposit growth has been great. The weighted average loan to value of the specialty real estate portfolio was 40%, that's a very safe loan on a lending basis. Are there problem loans in Axos' financial books? Absolutely, just as there is for every other financial. But tell me why? I've just given you all these wonderful growth metrics and performance metrics from the most recent quarter for Axos. Tell me why these scary bullet points that Hindenburg has brought out, why should those trump the actual pretty good performance that Axos has been posting up?Ricky Mulvey: I'll give you a straw, man. I don't know if that was rhetorical. I think Hindenburg would say it's because they've gone so far out on the risk curve that eventually as many of these projects break down especially, apartment buildings in New York City, for example, that that's going to dramatically change the returns and Axos isn't necessarily as forthright about the risks involved with the investments underlying their assets.Jim Gillies: Sure. That's a great rebuttal. But number 1, how do you know beyond just reading Hindenburg's report? Given the recency bias going on here, I would argue none of us know that. Second of all, I just did quote you that the average LTV of the specialty real estate portfolio was 40%. What that means is, don't come after me for individual loans but in aggregate, that portfolio could lose 50% of its value and the LTV would still be 80%. The other rejoinder I would offer up is apartments in New York might be coming down on price, but I still think they're probably going to hold their value. I don't think I will ever see a world where New York real estate is terribly cheap. But the point is you've got Hindenburg's assertions, which are front of mind right now for a lot of people and as I mentioned about that Shopify short report, when that came out, a lot of people panic sold Shopify. Shopify has been about a 10 bagger since then. Not pack predicting that for Axos, but I'm just saying here, yes, what essentially it boils down to for Hindenburg here is they are saying Axos' future is going to look a lot different than its past. You can have shorts who I respect, like I mentioned Jim Chanos before. Jim Chanos went after Restaurant Brands International back in the day, franchising parent of Burger King, Tim Hortons, Popeyes, and Firehouse Subs. I read his report, I said, I think that's wrong. It's been a great investment since. Another one, Carson Block and Muddy Waters, I have all the respect in the world for them. They took down Sino-Forest, which was basically a forestry plantation in China traded on the Canadian markets, a bit of a fraud. They, of course, protested and screamed and yelled, and rent their garments and then filed for bankruptcy a year later so they had the goods there. But Muddy Waters themselves went after Fairfax Financial, which is another Canadian company. A lot of times people equate them to Canada's Berkshire Hathaway style company. Extremely puzzling why they'd go after that company because they went after them based on an accounting minutia that frankly was silly. You can have even a well respected short seller who brings receipts. They can still frankly, come to erroneous conclusions. But let's say they are successful in driving the share price down 10%, 20%, 30%. They're going to be very quiet and cover their position and you won't know it. There may be a lot of smoke here and a lot of fire here, there might not be. The day to figure that out is not on the day when the report drops and everyone's panic selling. Take your time, think it through, try to check up and independently verify. I will say this, the last thing I'm going to say about this report in Hindenburg. What if I told you there's a mistake in the first bullet point where it says it's headquartered in San Diego? It's not. It's headquartered in Las Vegas. You've made that silly little error in the first bullet point. Are there others?Ricky Mulvey: It's because they have so many bullet points. All these short sellers want to have as many bullet points as possible. There's one in the report. It's like banking started in Mesopotamia. We got to wrap this up. Speaking of wrapping it up, I want to hit this retail topic because we're running low on time. We're going to go to the DICK's Sporting Goods and the Academy Sports call because DICK'S Sporting Goods is a specialty retailer in sporting goods. It's gone off like a rocket over the past five years. You think something similar might happen to Academy Sports and Outdoors, which has had a good track record over the past five years. It's a little bit more of a discount option to your DICK'S Sporting Goods where, for example, you can pick up and try on shoes at their stores without having an associate go in the back and grab one for you. But give me the call on this, let's talk Academy Sports before we go.Jim Gillies: Sure. Academy Sports, five years ago, they came up with a five-year plan, and their plan was ambitious. I think 2019 they were voted the most likely to take the sweet embrace of bankruptcy, management came in or new management rather, I should say, got revamped. They came out with a five-year plan. Five years later, they hit all their targets. They did a really good job. They produced a lot of cash flow, and they used that cash flow in the services shareholders. The interesting thing about Academy Sports is the stock since IPO absolutely just murdered the market. Generally, I say stay away from IPOs for a year or two just to let them get their public feet. Academy Sports would be the exception to the rule. They've done fantastic. Last year, with the successful five-year plan now in the rearview, they came up with another five-year plan and again, they've hit reasonable targets. As I've worked through this retailer, as I look at them and say, they talk about, well, here's our store growth plan, I've hair cut that. Here's our margin plan, I hair cut that. Here are our return on invested capital, here's how fast we want to turn our inventory, and here's our e-commerce penetration we're aiming for. All of that is hair cut. I like to run various valuation techniques, but one of the more common ones is a discounted cash flow, which is generally an exercise and false precision, but we try to get around that. As I work through Academy Sports, and this is another recommendation that hit James candidates for full disclosure. Even as I start hair-cutting things and start smacking things down, I think the share price is demonstrably undervalued versus what it can do. Then we just saw as you mentioned, DICK'S Sporting Goods, their most recent earnings report was really far stronger than the street was expecting, and the stock reacted accordingly. I'm sitting here with a company that is very similar. It is a bit more of a discount, it's a bit more regional. They have more growth expectations and plans than DICK'S does at this point. But I'm like, as they keep on enacting their growth plans, I think there's a reasonable case to be made that the current price is significantly undervaluing the future cash flows of the business. Then what if they actually deliver what they said they were going to do? Because like I said, I hair cut the whole thing. What if they actually deliver what they said they're going to try to do? If they do, then this stock is not just demonstrably undervalued, it is significant.Jim Gillies: That's where I'm coming down Academy Sports. There have been some strange stories in retail of late. I will grant you that. But I look at Academy Sports, and I think hat's what's pretty good.Ricky Mulvey: That's a good place to end it. One of these days, Jim, we're going to hit three stories. One of these days. But not today.Jim Gillies: Not today.Ricky Mulvey: Jim, thanks for your time and your insight. Thanks for hopping on.Jim Gillies: Thank you.Ricky Mulvey: Ricky Mulvey with Motley Fool Money here to tell you about a vehicle that is redefining sporting luxury, the Range Rover Sport. The first thing I noticed when I sat down in the driver's seat is that I felt like I was in a cockpit. You're up off the ground in a focused interior that promotes exhilarating driver engagement. I also really appreciated the overhead 360-degree cam review that let me know exactly where I was going as I was backing out of the parking space. I went for a drive in the Range Rover Sport out in Littleton, Colorado and tested the accelerator just a little bit and felt the performance and agility. It's an instinctive drive with engaging on-road dynamics and effortless composure. To put it plainly, the Range Rover Sport is powerful. It's also quiet and comfortable. Advanced cabin technologies such as active noise cancellation and cabin air purification offer new levels of comfort and refinement. The third-generation Range Rover Sport is the most desirable, advanced, and dynamically capable yet. I'd like to invite you to visit landroverusa.com to learn more about the Range Rover Sport. Up next. A fee-only financial planner sounds very similar to a fee-based planner. But the difference can be significant. Robert Brokamp caught up with Eileen Freiburger, Managing Director of the Garrett Planning Network to discuss what you should expect when you go to see a financial advisor.Robert Brokamp: What is a fee-only financial planner? What makes someone fee-only?Eileen Freiburger: What's been fascinating to me is how the industry has changed this term as it's been used. Fee-only absolutely means the only payments are made from the consumer directly to the advisor. That would mean no commissions, no kickbacks, no third-party reimbursements. Fee-only is that sense of I the client am absolutely paying you directly either from a debit from the account if it's an assets under management, or by a credit card, if it's advice only, if it's an hourly project, by check, by credit card, and by that relationships project scope. Now, where the industries changed a bit is now some people can still be fee-only but still have an arm that might be affiliated with another sector. Maybe it's still affiliated with a broker-dealer, maybe it's still affiliated with the wirehouse. A lot of people are fee-only on one side of the house but not necessarily the other side of the house. Again, that's also come up a little bit I think with the use of fiduciary. We'd like to believe that everyone that says they're a fiduciary is also fee-only 100% in compensation only from the client but you've got to dig and that's the shame of what I think has happened to the wording of the industry. I'm hoping as me being here as part of Garrett, educate the consumer what you ask for must be confirmed to be true. You've now got to do a little bit more digging in order to confirm the person you're engaging with really is what you intended. The last part which you've heard, everyone thinks fee-based is fee-only. Fee-based to me means that person might be wearing the two hats. One side can do the hourly or the project-based or the retainer model, the other side might be doing a little bit more on the product side. Again, the average consumer tosses around all of these terms and the future advisor nods their head but it doesn't mean that they got what they were expecting.Robert Brokamp: One of the points, of course, is that if you are paying the planner directly as opposed to commission, there are fewer conflicts of interest because if someone is being paid by a commission you're not always sure they are recommending something to you that is best for you or it's best for them because they're getting the biggest commission.Eileen Freiburger: Correct. I'm going to take this even further by saying there's always conflicts in every one of these relationships. Even if someone is fee-only and is charging an asset under management a lot of people will say there's a conflict because then the advisor wants more assets under-wing. But again, a true fiduciary is going to say, hey, I understand that you're considering buying a property. Let's look at the mortgage situation. Should we take 100% of those monies out of your account to have you with no mortgage? Or should we look at the planning and see if maybe keeping some portion of a mortgage makes more sense for you? What's best for the consumer? Even in the world of fee-only, and again, fee-only would also encompass somebody that's managing assets, there's always conflicts. Again because I've worn so many hats in the industry, in some cases maybe a one-time commission is still better for the consumer than an ongoing retainer relationship or an ongoing assets under management. There's never really going to be an absolute, you have to do it this way. Consumer must continue to ask the questions and become educated.Robert Brokamp: Let's say someone has used Garrett or NAPFA or any of the other networks and they've identified, let's say three financial planners that look like could be a good fit. What's the next step and how do you narrow down to the one person you want to work with?Eileen Freiburger: I think that's a great question. I would encourage a consumer to say to the advisor, \"Am I a good fit for you? Have you worked with other people like this? How much experience do you have in this specific type situation?\" You're interviewing each other and it's just as important that the advisor feels that you're a good fit for them. Versus also, are they a good fit for you, because you don't want to be with someone that took you just because but that's not really their strength or their background or their experience. I personally experience and sometimes you look at someone's profile and it might say they've only had their advisory office for a year or two. But you know what? They had background in the industry. They didn't open their own firm but they had very strong industry background. Or now when I talk to many second-career people maybe they had a disabled child. Maybe they've done life planning on behalf of parents that are now in care facilities or end-of-life planning and hospice planning. You wrap that person with not necessarily having run their own advisory firm for many years but having life experiences and have pursued the CFP and passed the CFP and have experience now it's a whole different world. Again, I think a lot of it comes back to, are you familiar and experienced enough in my situation, or under what I'm describing, are you learning on my time? I would be very open in asking those questions. It's the same on someone who might need budgeting help. Maybe a very experienced planner maybe that's not the right person to call and say, hey, I want to work on getting out of debt or budget planning? That might no longer be that person's specialty but it may have been when they first opened 10, 15, whatever years ago. Perhaps though now they have someone else in their office. Under that same question, if I later hire you, I'm talking to you today. Are you the person I'm interacting with in the future or did I get assigned to someone else or a team, how often if I'm interviewing you or you my point in the future? You're looking for is at the right fit on all these different levels.Robert Brokamp: The examples you use emphasize an important point. When people think of financial advisor some people might think of mostly portfolio management, but it can cover everything, retirement, tax planning, estate planning, insurance planning, college planning. I think if you are looking for a planner one thing to do is to write down exactly what you are looking for beforehand. You're clear on what you want from that person. When you have that first discussion about whether you're a good fit you know exactly what type of financial planning you're looking for.Eileen Freiburger: Ask what kind of output? Is it a financial plan? Is it an on-the-fly? Are we talking through this together? I'm a really firm believer under the current advisory scene. Anyone that's paying for assets under management. Again, for some people that might be right and they might be willing to do it but I really hope if you're paying a percentage it came with a financial plan. What I call a financial plan is the person you're working with should be able to say, here's where you are today. Here's your spending. Here's what you're putting into savings toward retirement. Gee, if we look at today's financials and we fast forward 15, 20, 30 years in the future, what might it look like? Then if that's the appropriate long-term relationship. Again, then this could be hourly project-based. But an appropriate long-term relationship means, you then periodically say, \"Okay, now I veered a little bit.\" We did the original plan, we looked at spending less, retiring at different ages, college planning for kids. Life happens, things change. Anyone you interview should be able to explain to you how they will be able to be there in the future to answer whatever financial question comes up for you. I'm going to go so far as to say when I had my advisory firm, I've had clients call me saying, hey, I'm in this other state on vacation and my gosh, I think I saw the perfect property. What can I afford to bid up to? That's not a question that you want to say, we've never built a financial plan. I really don't know. You want to be able to say, my gosh, that's a great question. Gee, since we've already spent the time working on baseline planning let me factor in some ranges. Are you still retiring at these times? I can look at the tax ramifications, I can look at the down payment, I can look at the mortgage. Let me get back to you and I'll be able to give you a better sense of what do you think you can afford. We can discuss what you might have to give up if you're making a little bit above that range to just be fair to the conversation. But that financial planner should be the first person you go to Illnesses, life happens, college planning, special decisions. All of that's a part of it. It shouldn't be, I only manage your portfolio I wish I could help you with this. No, that's what you should be paying a financial planner for.Robert Brokamp: Let's move on to the discussion of becoming a financial planner. I know there are many Motley Fool readers and listeners who have become so involved in learning about finances. They become very interested in it and they think, well, Golly, maybe I should make this my career. It's one of Garrett's specialties in that it helps people move on from one career to another to transition to the financial planning profession. Let's start with that and if someone is thinking about it what are some of the things they should start doing to investigate whether it's a possibility for them?Eileen Freiburger: Great questions because there's such a need and what a great career path. For starters, the industries, NAPFA, National Association of Personal Financial Advisers. Go to their meetings, go to the website, start meeting people. As you've mentioned earlier, Michael Kitces, is an XYPN is very similar to the Garrett Planning Network. You're looking for local organizations, membership-driven organizations that if you wanted to hang a shingle, how do you get through the RIA process? How do you file? Are you getting insurance? Are you getting training? I'm going to toss out something that I think has become very new, but Hannah Moore, I'm happy to give her a pitch is Amplified Planning. She's doing an eight-week externship program at rates, $350 for eight weeks to be able to monitor and view and practice real client meetings, get a sense of the technology. Again, if you think you're interested in this, find ways to incorporate, how would I do it? What does it look like? Go to NAPFA, go to Garrett, go to XYPN, find advisors in your community, ask to meet them for socially. Can they do a Zoom meeting? Just to talk about the industry. Can they invite you to some of the various sessions or retreats or conferences that are going on out there? There's so many people that enjoy doing what we do that even in retirement are managing their own monies, they're playing with the software, they're doing all of this because they enjoy it. Again, this is taped, but come on, if it's no longer a hobby, but it's a business. Think about all of what you can be doing around this profession.For anyone that's earlier in their careers, starting entry levels I recently saw an advisor was posting a position for over six figure with the partnership track. I know depending on the affluency of the communities I've seen entry-level positions with people in the CFP profession, meaning they're pursuing it and they've started it 60,000-90,000 for starting positions. Don't get yourself. This is a career and a profession that has so many different ways to develop and explore. More and more so for the iron core career second career person. This is also the opportunity for a lifestyle firm. If you're not managing assets and you're working hourly project base, one of the reasons why it's difficult to find an advisor, they might not be working a full year. They take off also around certain seasons. When you're managing assets, there's a much different level that you have to be there daily. When you're working on an hourly project basis and helping people self-implement, it is a little easier to take it a lifestyle if someone chooses to. But on the other side of that the fun part about coming back to the Garrett Planning Network is folks that started with me when they were first starting out are still there they're running some very large firms now. Again, what firm do you want to create? What's your vision in the future or earlier in your career? What a phenomenal profession.Ricky Mulvey: As always, people on the program may have interests in the stocks they talk about, and The Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell anything based solely on what you hear.

has another target in its sights  you re listening to motley fool money  i m ricky mulvey  joined today by jim gillies  jim  good to see you jim gillies  good to be seen  ricky ricky mulvey  when hindenburg research goes after a company  a lot of people pay attention  but i m not going to assume all of the listeners are familiar with this short selling firm and why we would care so much about it  why is hindenburg particularly worth listening to  why is it worth investors attention jim gillies  well  as with anything in the investing space  i suppose  you are what your record says you are  and hindenburg s record says they re pretty good at this shorting thing  i ll give you a couple  they went after nikola  the hydrogen based electric car manufacturer fraud  they went after them i think in late 2020  the stock s down about 97  since then they went after clover health in february i believe of 2021  i think that stock s down about 95 plus percent since then  believe me  there are some shorts who are clown shows and should be ignored or preferably laughed at  i don t think hindenburg is one  i have a lot of respect for what hindenburg has done  i may or may not agree with them  but just like other shorts who i like  muddy waters  carson block  he s done some very good work  of course  jim chanos  he s the godfather of shorts for my generation of investors  you don t have to agree with all of their calls  i certainly don t  but i think it s always worthwhile paying attention to what they re saying because i think they can often unearth some things that are worth you knowing at least to say  no  that s not right  no  that s incorrect  or no  this is serious  this is something i should look at  i m not someone that demonizes short sellers  i actually think they re a valuable part of the market environment story continuesricky mulvey  let s talk about what hindenburg is saying about axos financial  the original bull case for the company is basically a digital bank that s really good investing deposits in a less risky way  and it seems that what hindenburg is saying at a large level is actually this bank is taking on a ton of risk in commercial real estate and a lot of their loans might not be paid back by the borrowers they gave money to jim gillies  that s a risk of banking that you ve made poor loans that do not get repaid ricky mulvey  it s looking a lot at the commercial real estate exposure  this is where the spotlight is going   axos total commercial real estate exposure has ballooned to 53  of total net loans   points out that it s peers are closer to about 16   a lot of these loans are in the new york area where commercial real estate has had a bit of a change in valuation  there are some highlights in the report  jim  i m going to give you mine first  and then i d like to hear what your highlights are  they re talking about one loan in particular   one reason most banks don t lend up to 97 5 million to individuals with multiple indictments and documented mob ties is that even if things go well  it can be difficult to get your money back  this is made even more challenging when things go poorly as seems to be the case with this property   that s pretty juicy  anything in this report  any of the bullet points  you have a litany of them  any of the bullet points  claims  takes that really stand out to you jim gillies  well  that one actually  that was the one that stuck out to me  mainly because you got to love something talking about multiple indictments and mob ties  but here s the thing when it comes to short reports  again  i have all the time in the world for hindenburg  i will absolutely listen to hindenburg when they come for some of my companies and by the way  this is a recommendation of mine and the service i run here in james  canada  but i m perfectly fine with them coming out here  what i want to impress upon the listener is short reports are designed to scare you  they are designed to perhaps invoke an emotional reaction because a short  of course  makes money when the stock goes down and if you read the disclosure here  hindenburg is short the shares  they have borrowed shares from other investors  they have sold them into the market  and they will be looking to buy them back at a later date maybe even as early as today  probably not  but they were looking to buy them back at a lower price at a later date and pocket the difference and call it a profit  short reports are designed to scare you and sometimes some of the points that they make may be a little dressed up to be somewhat histrionic or convey a sense of just urgency and scariness that may or may not be there  the example i ll give you is in october of 2017  a short called citron research run by a gentleman named andrew left  who i do not hold in the esteem with which i hold hindenburg  i will put that out there and let you draw your own conclusions he came out with a short report on shopify  which at the time i think was about  10 canadian ballpark  the split adjusted somewhere  10 and  15 canadian  it was histrionics  it was basically saying that they would have to be shut down by regulators and authorities  if you actually went through and thought it through  a lot of their bullet points that they made  which were all scary just like hindenburg s ones are here  didn t hold a lot of water  like talking about  well  they was in the referral business  so people could get referrals for starting a new business on shopify  you get  2 500 for starting a referral blah  you could get these finders fees  but you can only get them for people that started giant businesses on shopify  you and i starting a sock reselling business on shopify wouldn t have gotten a penny  but if you brought nestle on board  you d get a  2 500 finder s fee for bringing a company the size and heft of nestle onto the shopify platform  but i m going to give you a couple of things here  an investor  when they hear about a short report  first off  the best thing you can do is to do nothing  take your time  you re not going to get out in front of the people panic selling because of the short report  the stock  i think it opened up down 15  today  as we speak  it s down about 7 8   it s already starting to rebound  second off  forget what hindenburg has done  but if i tell you here  if i tell you that in the most recent quarter  axos boosted net income by 38   boosted earnings per share by 44 5  because they have been buying back their own stock  their net interest margin  a very important metric for banks was 4 87  up from 4 42 a year before  to put that into context  being canadian  i watched the big canadian banks a lot  again  axos financial  formerly known as bank of internet  4 87  net interest margin  in canada  the big banks which are all beautifully solid and whatever  the average was up 1 74   their capital looked good  their book value was up 24   they re actively repurching  they had a bunch of cash well above the uninsured deposits  their deposit growth has been great  the weighted average loan to value of the specialty real estate portfolio was 40   that s a very safe loan on a lending basis  are there problem loans in axos  financial books  absolutely  just as there is for every other financial  but tell me why  i ve just given you all these wonderful growth metrics and performance metrics from the most recent quarter for axos  tell me why these scary bullet points that hindenburg has brought out  why should those trump the actual pretty good performance that axos has been posting up ricky mulvey  i ll give you a straw  man  i don t know if that was rhetorical  i think hindenburg would say it s because they ve gone so far out on the risk curve that eventually as many of these projects break down especially  apartment buildings in new york city  for example  that that s going to dramatically change the returns and axos isn t necessarily as forthright about the risks involved with the investments underlying their assets jim gillies  sure  that s a great rebuttal  but number 1  how do you know beyond just reading hindenburg s report  given the recency bias going on here  i would argue none of us know that  second of all  i just did quote you that the average ltv of the specialty real estate portfolio was 40   what that means is  don t come after me for individual loans but in aggregate  that portfolio could lose 50  of its value and the ltv would still be 80   the other rejoinder i would offer up is apartments in new york might be coming down on price  but i still think they re probably going to hold their value  i don t think i will ever see a world where new york real estate is terribly cheap  but the point is you ve got hindenburg s assertions  which are front of mind right now for a lot of people and as i mentioned about that shopify short report  when that came out  a lot of people panic sold shopify  shopify has been about a 10 bagger since then  not pack predicting that for axos  but i m just saying here  yes  what essentially it boils down to for hindenburg here is they are saying axos  future is going to look a lot different than its past  you can have shorts who i respect  like i mentioned jim chanos before  jim chanos went after restaurant brands international back in the day  franchising parent of burger king  tim hortons  popeyes  and firehouse subs  i read his report  i said  i think that s wrong  it s been a great investment since  another one  carson block and muddy waters  i have all the respect in the world for them  they took down sino forest  which was basically a forestry plantation in china traded on the canadian markets  a bit of a fraud  they  of course  protested and screamed and yelled  and rent their garments and then filed for bankruptcy a year later so they had the goods there  but muddy waters themselves went after fairfax financial  which is another canadian company  a lot of times people equate them to canada s berkshire hathaway style company  extremely puzzling why they d go after that company because they went after them based on an accounting minutia that frankly was silly  you can have even a well respected short seller who brings receipts  they can still frankly  come to erroneous conclusions  but let s say they are successful in driving the share price down 10   20   30   they re going to be very quiet and cover their position and you won t know it  there may be a lot of smoke here and a lot of fire here  there might not be  the day to figure that out is not on the day when the report drops and everyone s panic selling  take your time  think it through  try to check up and independently verify  i will say this  the last thing i m going to say about this report in hindenburg  what if i told you there s a mistake in the first bullet point where it says it s headquartered in san diego  it s not  it s headquartered in las vegas  you ve made that silly little error in the first bullet point  are there others ricky mulvey  it s because they have so many bullet points  all these short sellers want to have as many bullet points as possible  there s one in the report  it s like banking started in mesopotamia  we got to wrap this up  speaking of wrapping it up  i want to hit this retail topic because we re running low on time  we re going to go to the dick s sporting goods and the academy sports call because dick s sporting goods is a specialty retailer in sporting goods  it s gone off like a rocket over the past five years  you think something similar might happen to academy sports and outdoors  which has had a good track record over the past five years  it s a little bit more of a discount option to your dick s sporting goods where  for example  you can pick up and try on shoes at their stores without having an associate go in the back and grab one for you  but give me the call on this  let s talk academy sports before we go jim gillies  sure  academy sports  five years ago  they came up with a five year plan  and their plan was ambitious  i think 2019 they were voted the most likely to take the sweet embrace of bankruptcy  management came in or new management rather  i should say  got revamped  they came out with a five year plan  five years later  they hit all their targets  they did a really good job  they produced a lot of cash flow  and they used that cash flow in the services shareholders  the interesting thing about academy sports is the stock since ipo absolutely just murdered the market  generally  i say stay away from ipos for a year or two just to let them get their public feet  academy sports would be the exception to the rule  they ve done fantastic  last year  with the successful five year plan now in the rearview  they came up with another five year plan and again  they ve hit reasonable targets  as i ve worked through this retailer  as i look at them and say  they talk about  well  here s our store growth plan  i ve hair cut that  here s our margin plan  i hair cut that  here are our return on invested capital  here s how fast we want to turn our inventory  and here s our e commerce penetration we re aiming for  all of that is hair cut  i like to run various valuation techniques  but one of the more common ones is a discounted cash flow  which is generally an exercise and false precision  but we try to get around that  as i work through academy sports  and this is another recommendation that hit james candidates for full disclosure  even as i start hair cutting things and start smacking things down  i think the share price is demonstrably undervalued versus what it can do  then we just saw as you mentioned  dick s sporting goods  their most recent earnings report was really far stronger than the street was expecting  and the stock reacted accordingly  i m sitting here with a company that is very similar  it is a bit more of a discount  it s a bit more regional  they have more growth expectations and plans than dick s does at this point  but i m like  as they keep on enacting their growth plans  i think there s a reasonable case to be made that the current price is significantly undervaluing the future cash flows of the business  then what if they actually deliver what they said they were going to do  because like i said  i hair cut the whole thing  what if they actually deliver what they said they re going to try to do  if they do  then this stock is not just demonstrably undervalued  it is significant jim gillies  that s where i m coming down academy sports  there have been some strange stories in retail of late  i will grant you that  but i look at academy sports  and i think hat s what s pretty good ricky mulvey  that s a good place to end it  one of these days  jim  we re going to hit three stories  one of these days  but not today jim gillies  not today ricky mulvey  jim  thanks for your time and your insight  thanks for hopping on jim gillies  thank you ricky mulvey  ricky mulvey with motley fool money here to tell you about a vehicle that is redefining sporting luxury  the range rover sport  the first thing i noticed when i sat down in the driver s seat is that i felt like i was in a cockpit  you re up off the ground in a focused interior that promotes exhilarating driver engagement  i also really appreciated the overhead 360 degree cam review that let me know exactly where i was going as i was backing out of the parking space  i went for a drive in the range rover sport out in littleton  colorado and tested the accelerator just a little bit and felt the performance and agility  it s an instinctive drive with engaging on road dynamics and effortless composure  to put it plainly  the range rover sport is powerful  it s also quiet and comfortable  advanced cabin technologies such as active noise cancellation and cabin air purification offer new levels of comfort and refinement  the third generation range rover sport is the most desirable  advanced  and dynamically capable yet  i d like to invite you to visit landroverusa com to learn more about the range rover sport  up next  a fee only financial planner sounds very similar to a fee based planner  but the difference can be significant  robert brokamp caught up with eileen freiburger  managing director of the garrett planning network to discuss what you should expect when you go to see a financial advisor robert brokamp  what is a fee only financial planner  what makes someone fee only eileen freiburger  what s been fascinating to me is how the industry has changed this term as it s been used  fee only absolutely means the only payments are made from the consumer directly to the advisor  that would mean no commissions  no kickbacks  no third party reimbursements  fee only is that sense of i the client am absolutely paying you directly either from a debit from the account if it s an assets under management  or by a credit card  if it s advice only  if it s an hourly project  by check  by credit card  and by that relationships project scope  now  where the industries changed a bit is now some people can still be fee only but still have an arm that might be affiliated with another sector  maybe it s still affiliated with a broker dealer  maybe it s still affiliated with the wirehouse  a lot of people are fee only on one side of the house but not necessarily the other side of the house  again  that s also come up a little bit i think with the use of fiduciary  we d like to believe that everyone that says they re a fiduciary is also fee only 100  in compensation only from the client but you ve got to dig and that s the shame of what i think has happened to the wording of the industry  i m hoping as me being here as part of garrett  educate the consumer what you ask for must be confirmed to be true  you ve now got to do a little bit more digging in order to confirm the person you re engaging with really is what you intended  the last part which you ve heard  everyone thinks fee based is fee only  fee based to me means that person might be wearing the two hats  one side can do the hourly or the project based or the retainer model  the other side might be doing a little bit more on the product side  again  the average consumer tosses around all of these terms and the future advisor nods their head but it doesn t mean that they got what they were expecting robert brokamp  one of the points  of course  is that if you are paying the planner directly as opposed to commission  there are fewer conflicts of interest because if someone is being paid by a commission you re not always sure they are recommending something to you that is best for you or it s best for them because they re getting the biggest commission eileen freiburger  correct  i m going to take this even further by saying there s always conflicts in every one of these relationships  even if someone is fee only and is charging an asset under management a lot of people will say there s a conflict because then the advisor wants more assets under wing  but again  a true fiduciary is going to say  hey  i understand that you re considering buying a property  let s look at the mortgage situation  should we take 100  of those monies out of your account to have you with no mortgage  or should we look at the planning and see if maybe keeping some portion of a mortgage makes more sense for you  what s best for the consumer  even in the world of fee only  and again  fee only would also encompass somebody that s managing assets  there s always conflicts  again because i ve worn so many hats in the industry  in some cases maybe a one time commission is still better for the consumer than an ongoing retainer relationship or an ongoing assets under management  there s never really going to be an absolute  you have to do it this way  consumer must continue to ask the questions and become educated robert brokamp  let s say someone has used garrett or napfa or any of the other networks and they ve identified  let s say three financial planners that look like could be a good fit  what s the next step and how do you narrow down to the one person you want to work with eileen freiburger  i think that s a great question  i would encourage a consumer to say to the advisor   am i a good fit for you  have you worked with other people like this  how much experience do you have in this specific type situation   you re interviewing each other and it s just as important that the advisor feels that you re a good fit for them  versus also  are they a good fit for you  because you don t want to be with someone that took you just because but that s not really their strength or their background or their experience  i personally experience and sometimes you look at someone s profile and it might say they ve only had their advisory office for a year or two  but you know what  they had background in the industry  they didn t open their own firm but they had very strong industry background  or now when i talk to many second career people maybe they had a disabled child  maybe they ve done life planning on behalf of parents that are now in care facilities or end of life planning and hospice planning  you wrap that person with not necessarily having run their own advisory firm for many years but having life experiences and have pursued the cfp and passed the cfp and have experience now it s a whole different world  again  i think a lot of it comes back to  are you familiar and experienced enough in my situation  or under what i m describing  are you learning on my time  i would be very open in asking those questions  it s the same on someone who might need budgeting help  maybe a very experienced planner maybe that s not the right person to call and say  hey  i want to work on getting out of debt or budget planning  that might no longer be that person s specialty but it may have been when they first opened 10  15  whatever years ago  perhaps though now they have someone else in their office  under that same question  if i later hire you  i m talking to you today  are you the person i m interacting with in the future or did i get assigned to someone else or a team  how often if i m interviewing you or you my point in the future  you re looking for is at the right fit on all these different levels robert brokamp  the examples you use emphasize an important point  when people think of financial advisor some people might think of mostly portfolio management  but it can cover everything  retirement  tax planning  estate planning  insurance planning  college planning  i think if you are looking for a planner one thing to do is to write down exactly what you are looking for beforehand  you re clear on what you want from that person  when you have that first discussion about whether you re a good fit you know exactly what type of financial planning you re looking for eileen freiburger  ask what kind of output  is it a financial plan  is it an on the fly  are we talking through this together  i m a really firm believer under the current advisory scene  anyone that s paying for assets under management  again  for some people that might be right and they might be willing to do it but i really hope if you re paying a percentage it came with a financial plan  what i call a financial plan is the person you re working with should be able to say  here s where you are today  here s your spending  here s what you re putting into savings toward retirement  gee  if we look at today s financials and we fast forward 15  20  30 years in the future  what might it look like  then if that s the appropriate long term relationship  again  then this could be hourly project based  but an appropriate long term relationship means  you then periodically say   okay  now i veered a little bit   we did the original plan  we looked at spending less  retiring at different ages  college planning for kids  life happens  things change  anyone you interview should be able to explain to you how they will be able to be there in the future to answer whatever financial question comes up for you  i m going to go so far as to say when i had my advisory firm  i ve had clients call me saying  hey  i m in this other state on vacation and my gosh  i think i saw the perfect property  what can i afford to bid up to  that s not a question that you want to say  we ve never built a financial plan  i really don t know  you want to be able to say  my gosh  that s a great question  gee  since we ve already spent the time working on baseline planning let me factor in some ranges  are you still retiring at these times  i can look at the tax ramifications  i can look at the down payment  i can look at the mortgage  let me get back to you and i ll be able to give you a better sense of what do you think you can afford  we can discuss what you might have to give up if you re making a little bit above that range to just be fair to the conversation  but that financial planner should be the first person you go to illnesses  life happens  college planning  special decisions  all of that s a part of it  it shouldn t be  i only manage your portfolio i wish i could help you with this  no  that s what you should be paying a financial planner for robert brokamp  let s move on to the discussion of becoming a financial planner  i know there are many motley fool readers and listeners who have become so involved in learning about finances  they become very interested in it and they think  well  golly  maybe i should make this my career  it s one of garrett s specialties in that it helps people move on from one career to another to transition to the financial planning profession  let s start with that and if someone is thinking about it what are some of the things they should start doing to investigate whether it s a possibility for them eileen freiburger  great questions because there s such a need and what a great career path  for starters  the industries  napfa  national association of personal financial advisers  go to their meetings  go to the website  start meeting people  as you ve mentioned earlier  michael kitces  is an xypn is very similar to the garrett planning network  you re looking for local organizations  membership driven organizations that if you wanted to hang a shingle  how do you get through the ria process  how do you file  are you getting insurance  are you getting training  i m going to toss out something that i think has become very new  but hannah moore  i m happy to give her a pitch is amplified planning  she s doing an eight week externship program at rates   350 for eight weeks to be able to monitor and view and practice real client meetings  get a sense of the technology  again  if you think you re interested in this  find ways to incorporate  how would i do it  what does it look like  go to napfa  go to garrett  go to xypn  find advisors in your community  ask to meet them for socially  can they do a zoom meeting  just to talk about the industry  can they invite you to some of the various sessions or retreats or conferences that are going on out there  there s so many people that enjoy doing what we do that even in retirement are managing their own monies  they re playing with the software  they re doing all of this because they enjoy it  again  this is taped  but come on  if it s no longer a hobby  but it s a business  think about all of what you can be doing around this profession for anyone that s earlier in their careers  starting entry levels i recently saw an advisor was posting a position for over six figure with the partnership track  i know depending on the affluency of the communities i ve seen entry level positions with people in the cfp profession  meaning they re pursuing it and they ve started it 60 000 90 000 for starting positions  don t get yourself  this is a career and a profession that has so many different ways to develop and explore  more and more so for the iron core career second career person  this is also the opportunity for a lifestyle firm  if you re not managing assets and you re working hourly project base  one of the reasons why it s difficult to find an advisor  they might not be working a full year  they take off also around certain seasons  when you re managing assets  there s a much different level that you have to be there daily  when you re working on an hourly project basis and helping people self implement  it is a little easier to take it a lifestyle if someone chooses to  but on the other side of that the fun part about coming back to the garrett planning network is folks that started with me when they were first starting out are still there they re running some very large firms now  again  what firm do you want to create  what s your vision in the future or earlier in your career  what a phenomenal profession ricky mulvey  as always  people on the program may have interests in the stocks they talk about  and the motley fool may have formal recommendations for or against  so don t buy or sell anything based solely on what you hear  i m ricky mulvey  thanks for listening  we ll be back tomorrow jim gillies has positions in academy sports and outdoors  berkshire hathaway

                        "Shopify's (NYSE: SHOP) stock performance has been a mixed bag since the company went public in 2015. Those who bought in at the start and have held on since then are sitting on a 2,220% gain. But the stock has also taken some steep drops along the way. Over the past 30 days, for instance, shares have lost one-fifth of their value.What lies ahead for Shopify, operator of one of the world's largest e-commerce platforms? The answer isn't necessarily what you'd expect.This is what will happen to Shopify over the next yearShopify has been on a roller-coaster from a stock price perspective. But its fundamental results have been much more consistent.Take a look at Shopify's top line. The company has never had a quarter when revenue declined year over year. Its user count has also increased consistently. From a technology perspective, its service has only improved, with growing numbers of developers contributing to its functionality and, more recently, AI features introduced throughout its tech stack.All of this makes sense when you look at the underlying growth trends. Global e-commerce revenue has increased consistently for more than a decade, and according to the U.S. Commerce Department's International Trade Administration, global online spending is forecast to grow at an annualized rate of around 11.2% between 2023 and 2027. Because Shopify operates a platform that allows anyone from entrepreneurs working out of their own homes to multibillion-dollar businesses to rapidly set up feature-packed online storefronts, it's directly benefiting from this rising tide.It also benefits from one of the most powerful forces in the investing universe: network effects, which cause a product or service to get more valuable to each user as more people use it.To illustrate, consider Visa and Mastercard. Between them, these two companies control more than 86% of the U.S. credit and debit card market. That's because merchants want to accept the payment methods that consumers are most likely to use, and consumers will favor the payment options that more merchants accept. The natural result of that is industry consolidation.This dynamic is also playing out with Shopify, which currently has a 28% market share for e-commerce platforms in the U.S. Its second-largest competitor -- WooCommerce -- commands only 17% of the market, with a host of platforms rounding out the remainder. Over time, businesses that are benefiting from network effects tend to grow larger, gobbling up even more market share. Expect the same to happen with Shopify. By many measures, it already has a heavy tech lead over the competition and can afford to spend heavily on adding new functionality, especially as AI goes mainstream. Put simply, expect Shopify's competitive advantages to strengthen in the years to come.Story continuesSo where will Shopify be one year from now? From a business perspective, it will likely be stronger, with higher revenues, greater tech capabilities, and a more powerful hold over its market.But what will happen to the stock price?SHOP PS Ratio ChartWill Shopify's stock price rise over the next 12 months?Predicting where Shopify will be as a business one year from now is relatively easy. Predicting where its stock price will be is another story. Sure, its revenues have been on a consistent upward trajectory for years, but the valuations investors have put on that revenue stream have changed dramatically.In 2015, for example, Shopify shares were priced at 20 times sales. By 2016, they were priced at just 10 times sales. Then, in 2020, the company's valuation soared to 60 times sales. Today, it again trades at roughly 10 times sales.Some of these valuation swings were catalyzed by shifts in Shopify's annual revenue growth rate. Sure, its revenue has headed higher year after year, but the rates at which sales have grown have not been consistent.Will there be more such swings to come? Absolutely. But Shopify is targeting an underlying market that's expected to grow by double-digit percentage rates for years to come. Plus, it has a heavy lead on the competition, which should help it attract an even larger market share over time.No one can know for sure what Shopify's stock price will be one year from now. But we do know that today, its valuation in terms of the price-to-sales ratio is historically cheap. And we know that the business will likely be stronger next year and in the years after that. If you're willing and able to be patient through the ups and downs, expect Shopify to remain a lucrative long-term investment.Should you invest $1,000 in Shopify right now?Before you buy stock in Shopify, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Shopify wasn’t one of them.

                        'shopify s  nyse  shop  stock performance has been a mixed bag since the company went public in 2015  those who bought in at the start and have held on since then are sitting on a 2 220  gain  but the stock has also taken some steep drops along the way  over the past 30 days  for instance  shares have lost one fifth of their value what lies ahead for shopify  operator of one of the world s largest e commerce platforms  the answer isn t necessarily what you d expect this is what will happen to shopify over the next yearshopify has been on a roller coaster from a stock price perspective  but its fundamental results have been much more consistent take a look at shopify s top line  the company has never had a quarter when revenue declined year over year  its user count has also increased consistently  from a technology perspective  its service has only improved  with growing numbers of developers contributing to its functionality and  more recently  ai features introduced throughout its tech stack all of this makes sense when you look at the underlying growth trends  global e commerce revenue has increased consistently for more than a decade  and according to the u s  commerce department s international trade administration  global online spending is forecast to grow at an annualized rate of around 11 2  between 2023 and 2027  because shopify operates a platform that allows anyone from entrepreneurs working out of their own homes to multibillion dollar businesses to rapidly set up feature packed online storefronts  it s directly benefiting from this rising tide it also benefits from one of the most powerful forces in the investing universe  network effects  which cause a product or service to get more valuable to each user as more people use it to illustrate  consider visa and mastercard  between them  these two companies control more than 86  of the u s  credit and debit card market  that s because merchants want to accept the payment methods that consumers are most likely to use  and consumers will favor the payment options that more merchants accept  the natural result of that is industry consolidation this dynamic is also playing out with shopify  which currently has a 28  market share for e commerce platforms in the u s  its second largest competitor    woocommerce    commands only 17  of the market  with a host of platforms rounding out the remainder  over time  businesses that are benefiting from network effects tend to grow larger  gobbling up even more market share  expect the same to happen with shopify  by many measures  it already has a heavy tech lead over the competition and can afford to spend heavily on adding new functionality  especially as ai goes mainstream  put simply  expect shopify s competitive advantages to strengthen in the years to come story continuesso where will shopify be one year from now  from a business perspective  it will likely be stronger  with higher revenues  greater tech capabilities  and a more powerful hold over its market but what will happen to the stock price shop ps ratio chartwill shopify s stock price rise over the next 12 months predicting where shopify will be as a business one year from now is relatively easy  predicting where its stock price will be is another story  sure  its revenues have been on a consistent upward trajectory for years  but the valuations investors have put on that revenue stream have changed dramatically in 2015  for example  shopify shares were priced at 20 times sales  by 2016  they were priced at just 10 times sales  then  in 2020  the company s valuation soared to 60 times sales  today  it again trades at roughly 10 times sales some of these valuation swings were catalyzed by shifts in shopify s annual revenue growth rate  sure  its revenue has headed higher year after year  but the rates at which sales have grown have not been consistent will there be more such swings to come  absolutely  but shopify is targeting an underlying market that s expected to grow by double digit percentage rates for years to come  plus  it has a heavy lead on the competition  which should help it attract an even larger market share over time no one can know for sure what shopify s stock price will be one year from now  but we do know that today  its valuation in terms of the price to sales ratio is historically cheap  and we know that the business will likely be stronger next year and in the years after that  if you re willing and able to be patient through the ups and downs  expect shopify to remain a lucrative long term investment should you invest  1 000 in shopify right now before you buy stock in shopify  consider this the motley fool stock advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now  and shopify wasn t one of them  the 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years consider when nvidia

                        'AI is the hottest thing in stocks right now. Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) historic bull run, thanks to its AI-friendly business, is proof of this.As a result, many companies are looking to dabble in AI to capitalize off the phenomenon. However, not every such company is having such uninterrupted success as the graphic chips maker. That makes some of these companies AI stocks to sell this June.When a company’s stock starts going downhill, you need time to watch how it unfolds — preferably from a distance. That’s because it’s hard to tell when such a stock bounces back. It could be months or even years. Sometimes, it’s better to exit your position and put your money in a stock that’s actually promising.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWe identified three underperforming companies that could be AI stocks to sell so you can free up your capital for positions with better potential.C3.ai (AI)C3.ai (AI) logo on a smartphone with computer screen showing graph in background, symbolizing AI stockSource: shutterstock.com/Below the SkyC3.ai (NYSE:AI) is a company that supports businesses with AI tools and applications. Some of the world’s biggest organizations, such as Shell (NYSE:SHEL) Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Koch Industries and the U.S. Air Force have integrated its product.The company’s financials look fine on paper — 20% growth year-over-year (YOY) in the first quarter, free cash flow of $18.8 million and no debt. However, C3.ai is lacking in one thing: profitability.In its Q1 report, the company’s CEO Thomas M. Siebel said it’s foregoing profitability for now to focus on “lead generation, branding, market awareness and customer success,” which he believes presents a “market opportunity.” Siebel said he doesn’t expect the company to be profitable in 2024.That is all fine and dandy for the company — but not for investors — if its price pattern this year is anything to go by. Besides the occasional price spike, C3.ai stock price has largely been treading water.Analysts aren’t sold on it either, with MarketWatch giving it an average hold rating. If you have C3.ai in your portfolio and are looking for AI stocks to sell, you might want to consider letting it go.Dell Technologies (DELL)Dell (DELL) Technologies Display and LogoSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comDell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) is one of the few companies manufacturing powerful AI servers. Big corporations experimenting with AI need these servers to train and operate sophisticated AI models and applications.As a result, Dell’s share value has been on an upward momentum in the last two years because investors see the hardware manufacturer poised to profit from AI’s rise.Story continuesBut those hopes were dashed last month after the company’s Q1 report showed flat YOY revenues for its AI servers business. Dell shares have been down 22% since then and show no signs of improving, which raises the question of whether it’s an AI stock to sell after all.Bernstein Financial Services analyst Toni Sacconaghi raised the alarm about Dell’s AI servers “being sold at near-zero margins,” with Bloomberg analyst Woo Jin saying Dell’s current figures “cast some doubt on near-term competitiveness.”If you have a position in Dell, now is a good time to consider if it’s worth it, at least in the short term.Shopify (SHOP)Shopify on the phone display.Source: Burdun Iliya / Shutterstock.comShares of Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) slid 19% on May 8, the day of its first-quarter earnings release, and haven’t recovered since. The drop was the largest in one day for the Ottawa-based online retailer since it went public nine years ago.Investors fled after the company reported a net loss of $273 million and issued low guidance for the second quarter. While Shopify’s YOY revenue growth has fallen between the low-to-mid 20s in the past six quarters, the company is now forecasting revenue growth in the high teens in the second quarter.Shopify’s slump is due to an increasingly competitive niche. E-commerce giants Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT), as well as lesser-known companies Temu and Shein, are all vying for market share. The company is also grappling with a lull in online shopping post-pandemic.Following Shopify’s Q1 report, Third Bridge analyst Charlie Miner raised concerns about its profitability trajectory, noting it “sound[ed] the alarm bell for investors.”While a turnaround is still possible for Shopify, its current challenges make it one of the AI stocks to sell in June.On the date of publication, Hope Mutie did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the stocks mentioned in this article.

                        'eBay’s EBAY shares have risen 22.8% in the year-to-date period, outperforming the Zacks Internet-Commerce industry’s rally of 12%. The company is gaining from the growing momentum in its e-commerce platform. eBay is constantly making strong efforts to strengthen its marketplace on the heels of generative AI technology.In this regard, the latest rollout of an AI-powered background-enhancement tool powered by the open-source model Stable Diffusion bodes well.The tool is capable of removing the current image backgrounds and replacing them with a backdrop of choice automatically.Currently, the new background-enhancement tool is available in the United States, the U.K. and Germany for iOS users. It will be rolled out for Android users eventually.The underlined tool positions eBay well to gain substantial traction among several sellers who lack the skills or tools to create professional-looking backgrounds.eBay Inc. Price and Consensus eBay Inc. Price and ConsensuseBay Inc. price-consensus-chart | eBay Inc. QuoteGrowing AI Efforts Aid E-commerce ProspectsAccording to a Mordor Intelligence report, the global e-commerce market size is expected to hit $8.8 trillion in 2024 and reach $18.8 trillion by 2029, witnessing a CAGR of 15.8% between 2024 and 2029.Per Statista data, revenues in the e-commerce market are expected to hit $4.12 trillion in 2024 and reach $6.48 trillion by 2029 by seeing a CAGR of 9.5% over 2024-2029.Given the fact that AI and generative AI technologies have become mainstream in the e-commerce industry, eBay is well-poised to capitalize on the above-mentioned growth prospects on the back of its increasing AI efforts.eBay’s recent unveiling of a “shop the look” generative AI-powered feature within the iOS mobile app, offering personalized recommendations for customers, is noteworthy. This interactive feature suggests similar items and outfit inspirations based on customers’ shopping history, enabling fashionistas to shop for pre-owned and luxury items that match their style.The company’s collaboration with Microsoft to integrate Azure cloud-computing software and open AI application programming interface into its core listing flow is a plus.EBAY’s photo-to-listing AI tool is driving its momentum across marketplace sellers. The tool can create a product listing by automatically generating a title, description and information like product release date, category, subcategory, list price and shipping cost from a single photo.The company’s acquisition of Certilogo, an AI-powered provider of digital IDs and authentication for apparel and fashion goods, is another positive. The buyout enables eBay to provide consumers with reliable product information and activate circular services.These efforts are expected to aid eBay in delivering enhanced e-commerce experiences to both sellers and buyers, which, in turn, will boost traffic on its marketplace platform. This will drive its financial performance in the days ahead.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 revenues is pegged at $10.26 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 1.5%.The same for 2024 EPS stands at $4.70, implying growth of 10.9% from 2023’s actual. The estimate has moved 0.2% north in the past seven days.Story continuesGenerative AI Strength Aids Competitive EdgeGrowing generative AI capabilities will help the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company in competing with its peers like Amazon AMZN and Shopify SHOP, who are also making increasing efforts to incorporate generative AI within their marketplace. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Amazon’s introduction of an AI tool for sellers, which can write product listings from a series of keywords, remains noteworthy.

                        'Dollar Tree downgraded, Lululemon upgraded: Wall Street\'s top analyst callsThe most talked about and market moving research calls around Wall Street are now in one place. Here are today\'s research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.Top 5 Upgrades: HSBC upgraded Lululemon (LULU) to Buy from Hold with a $425 price target following the Q1 earnings report. The company\'s fiscal 2024 guidance is broadly unchanged while the recent stock selloff implied the market may have been bracing for some downward revision, the firm tells investors in a research note.Citi upgraded eBay (EBAY) to Buy from Neutral with a $64 price target after resuming coverage following a period of rating suspension. The firm sees an improved growth outlook and expects a return to margin expansion as well as upside to earnings estimates from share buybacks post the Adevinta sale.Redburn Atlantic upgraded United Airlines (UAL) to Buy from Neutral with a $70 price target. The firm upgraded United on its updated earnings forecast, saying the company\'s lower capex will drive robust free cash flow generation.Jefferies upgraded Capital One (COF) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $165, up from $145. The firm sees a "win-win" for owning the shares as a standalone company or potentially combined with Discover (DFS).UBS upgraded C.H. Robinson (CHRW) to Neutral from Sell with a price target of $90, up from $71. The firm expects the company\'s initiatives to support cost reduction and improving execution.Top 5 Downgrades:Citi downgraded Dollar Tree (DLTR) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $120, down from $163. While the Family Dollar turnaround has been on "shaky ground" for several quarters, the decision to explore strategic alternatives shows that management lacks confidence in the fix, signaling more structural issues than previously expected, the firm tells investors in a research note.MoffettNathanson downgraded Shopify (SHOP) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $65, down from $74. The firm sees continued downside risks to forecasts given Shopify\'s "bumpy" road ahead.Goldman Sachs downgraded Couchbase (BASE) to Sell from Neutral with a price target of $18, down from $30. The firm sees an increasingly competitive landscape "with a seemingly elevated valuation" for CouchbaseDA Davidson downgraded Sprinklr (CXM) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $9, down from $16. Sprinklr reported a modest beat this quarter but lowered its fiscal 2025 revenue guidance as a result of a softer than expected demand environment which is assumed to be the norm through the rest of the year, the firm tells investors in a research note. Cantor Fitzgerald also downgraded Sprinklr to Neutral from Overweight with a price target of $10, down from $16.JMP Securities downgraded HashiCorp (HCP) to Market Perform from Outperform without a price target after the company entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by IBM (IBM) for $35 per share.Story continuesTop 5 Initiations: Deutsche Bank initiated coverage of Zeekr (ZK) with a Buy rating and $35 price target. Zeekr is a leading, premium smart electric vehicle maker in China with a well-established premium brand and leadership in electrification and auto industry innovation, the firm tells investors in a research note.Goldman Sachs initiated coverage of Iqvia (IQV) with a Buy rating and $270 price target. The firm sees Iqvia as a well-diversified business well positioned for share gains with a market leading position in data and technology. Goldman Sachs also started coverage of Icon (ICLR) and Charles River (CRL) with Buy ratings, and Fortrea Holdings (FTRE) with a Neutral rating.Mizuho initiated coverage of TreeHouse (THS) with a Neutral rating and $37 price target. The firm says TreeHouse\'s new model has yet to demonstrate greater resilience against traditional private label volatility and the downside risks to its growth targets "are tangible."Bernstein initiated coverage of Diamondback Energy (FANG) with an Outperform rating and $243 price target. The firm sees Diamondback as the "last and best oil sandbox."B. Riley analyst David Bain resumed coverage of DoubleDown (DDI) with a Buy rating and $24 price target. The firm believes DoubleDown\'s core business stabilization, net free cash flow generation, balance sheet optionality, expected revenue and EBITDA growth, and upward estimate revision potential create a "scarce investment opportunity in the current market environment."',

                        "Earnings season can be a turbulent period on Wall Street. Some companies impress investors enough to see their shares soar, while others receive a much less enthusiastic -- and sometimes even a downright catastrophic -- response from the market.E-commerce specialist Shopify (NYSE: SHOP) was in the latter group during the most recent earnings season, and as of this writing, the stock is down by 24% year to date. However, that's nothing for long-term investors to worry about; the company remains a solid long-term pick. Let's find out why.Shopify's first-quarter resultsShopify's first-quarter earnings looked decent on the surface. The company's revenue of $1.9 billion was up 23% year over year, the same growth rate as its gross merchandise volume, which came in at $60.9 billion for the period. Shopify's gross margin landed at 51.4%, up from the 47.5% reported in the year-ago period. However, Shopify wasn't profitable. It reported a net loss per share of $0.21, compared to a net income of $0.05 in the year-ago period.Investors ignored the red on Shopify's bottom line for a long time since its top line was growing so fast. But things have changed; long gone are the days of growth at all costs. In this higher-interest-rate environment -- at least higher than they were for most of the previous decade -- investors prefer to put their money in consistently profitable companies. That's a problem for Shopify, whose revenue isn't growing nearly as fast as it once did.Things will worsen during the second quarter since Shopify expects top-line year-over-year growth in the high teens. The company's valuation only compounds the problem.SHOP PS Ratio (Forward) ChartEven after its recent decline, Shopify's forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is nearly 9; the undervalued range is typically under 2. Shopify looks expensive, unquestionably. Are there any good reasons to buy the stock?What's your investment horizon?Shopify stock isn't for everyone. Obviously, there is nothing to see for dividend investors. Shopify doesn't pay any. For value investors, the stock probably isn't that attractive either. However, for growth-oriented investors who intend to hold onto the company's shares for at least five years, the company looks like a smart buy, especially considering the 24% drop since the year started. Let's consider three reasons why.First, Shopify has made some changes and tweaks to its business in recent years that should allow it to achieve consistent profitability much faster than it otherwise would have. Most notably, the company sold off its expensive and low-margin logistics business. Second, Shopify is implementing various initiatives -- especially artificial intelligence (AI)-powered efforts -- that should help improve merchant productivity on its platform.Story continuesLast year, the company launched Shopify Magic, a suite of AI-based tools. Helping merchants do things like write product descriptions makes their lives easier which, in turn, attracts more merchants to Shopify's platform. There is plenty more room to grow since the e-commerce industry will expand rapidly through the end of the decade. Third, Shopify benefits from switching costs.Imagine spending countless hours building a customized online storefront, integrating various functionalities that only Shopify offers thanks to its app store with thousands of options, attracting customers via all the major social media platforms, and building a noticeable brand your target market starts to recognize. After doing all that, migrating to one of Shopify's competitors would be risky.While it's doable, the operation runs the risk of disrupting the business's day-to-day activities. And starting from scratch is out of the question. Shopify's high switching costs grant it a powerful competitive advantage: In all likelihood, the stock will remain a leader in its niche of the e-commerce field for a while. That's why it is worth at least a bit of premium, in my view. Perhaps it currently trades at too much of a premium, but in five years or more, that won't matter much.Shopify is well-positioned to deliver market-beating returns over the long run, just like it has since its 2015 IPO. That's why the stock is a smart buy.Should you invest $1,000 in Shopify right now?Before you buy stock in Shopify, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Shopify wasn’t one of them.

gone are the days of growth at all costs  in this higher interest rate environment    at least higher than they were for most of the previous decade    investors prefer to put their money in consistently profitable companies  that s a problem for shopify  whose revenue isn t growing nearly as fast as it once did things will worsen during the second quarter since shopify expects top line year over year growth in the high teens  the company s valuation only compounds the problem shop ps ratio  forward  charteven after its recent decline  shopify s forward price to sales  p s  ratio is nearly 9  the undervalued range is typically under 2  shopify looks expensive  unquestionably  are there any good reasons to buy the stock what s your investment horizon shopify stock isn t for everyone  obviously  there is nothing to see for dividend investors  shopify doesn t pay any  for value investors  the stock probably isn t that attractive either  however  for growth oriented investors who intend to hold onto the company s shares for at least five years  the company looks like a smart buy  especially considering the 24  drop since the year started  let s consider three reasons why first  shopify has made some changes and tweaks to its business in recent years that should allow it to achieve consistent profitability much faster than it otherwise would have  most notably  the company sold off its expensive and low margin logistics business  second  shopify is implementing various initiatives    especially artificial intelligence  ai  powered efforts    that should help improve merchant productivity on its platform story continueslast year  the company launched shopify magic  a suite of ai based tools  helping merchants do things like write product descriptions makes their lives easier which  in turn  attracts more merchants to shopify s platform  there is plenty more room to grow since the e commerce industry will expand rapidly through the end of the decade  third  shopify benefits from switching costs imagine spending countless hours building a customized online storefront  integrating various functionalities that only shopify offers thanks to its app store with thousands of options  attracting customers via all the major social media platforms  and building a noticeable brand your target market starts to recognize  after doing all that  migrating to one of shopify s competitors would be risky while it s doable  the operation runs the risk of disrupting the business s day to day activities  and starting from scratch is out of the question  shopify s high switching costs grant it a powerful competitive advantage  in all likelihood  the stock will remain a leader in its niche of the e commerce field for a while  that s why it is worth at least a bit of premium  in my view  perhaps it currently trades at too much of a premium  but in five years or more  that won t matter much shopify is well positioned to deliver market beating returns over the long run  just like it has since its 2015 ipo  that s why the stock is a smart buy should you invest  1 000 in shopify right now before you buy stock in shopify

                        'Flexport CEO Ryan Petersen discussed trends across the freight industry at FreightWaves’ Future of Supply Chain event in Atlanta. (Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)ATLANTA — Flexport CEO Ryan Petersen predicts that freight logistics will see a lot more AI usage, from ocean freight contract writing to other parts of the supply chain that currently involve manual input.“In five years we will be talking about what AI has done, which is take stuff we thought wasn’t going to be automatable, that’s taken us 10 years to wrangle data to structured ways that we  can write scripts and algorithms to process and take some action against, and it’s turned out to be really, really hard to where all of a sudden AI can just do it,” Petersen said.He was the keynote speaker on Day Two of FreightWaves’ Future of Supply Chain event in Atlanta. He was joined on stage Wednesday by FreightWaves CEO Craig Fuller in a discussion titled “Challenges and opportunities of integrating ocean and highway services.”“We see this with our ocean freight contract ingestion, which is a giant XML file that has tens of thousands of rows, port combos, and if-then statements, and it’s very hard to ingest this data,” Petersen said. “It would have taken us a couple of days to ingest those contracts and get them into our database; turns out OpenAI and others can ingest that thing and get it live into our marketplace in a few minutes. … I think you’re going to see that across the board in so many processes that were requiring manual intervention and are now able to be subjected to AI.”Flexport is a global solutions provider founded in 2013 by Petersen and is based in San Francisco.Last year, Flexport acquired e-commerce giant Shopify’s logistics arm, marking the company’s expansion into e-commerce fulfillment and last-mile delivery. In January, Flexport secured a $260 million investment from Shopify aimed at providing a boost during a challenging period in freight.“We had to totally revamp the business from a third-party model — Shopify logistics was the fulfillment arm of Shopify for e-commerce fulfillment, for exporting to the last-mile kind of end to end all the way from factory floor to customer doors, and built a retail distribution business around it,” Petersen said. “It was third-party, about 40 sites run by local 3PLs. We changed the model to five first-party buildings.”Petersen said while Flexport downsized Shopify’s logistics and fulfillment operation from 40 buildings to five, the new facilities were actually massive compared to the ones Shopify was previously using for e-commerce.“What we were finding was that the sites were too small. So when we got an order from a customer, if there were more than two items, a huge percentage of the time they were shipping from two different sites. We were splitting these merchants’ inventory too many times,” Petersen said. “Now the merchant’s inventory is consolidated at just a handful of sites.”Story continuesPetersen and Fuller also discussed the dismissal of Dave Clark as the company’s CEO in September. Petersen was reinstalled as CEO as part of the move.“From your perspective, what happened, what was the story there?” Fuller asked.“Dave ran supply chain and logistics for Amazon for 23 years and we hired him to be our CEO. He had an incredibly ambitious … talk about capital-intensive, let’s go big, invest, take Flexport to that level of an Amazon, and the amount of investments we made really kind of exceeded where we were, even though we have a very strong balance sheet,” Petersen said.Flexport has raised $2.35 billion in capital and has been valued at as much as $8 billion by venture capitalists.“I think we just had a misalignment for how ambitious of a company we should be. We want to be very ambitious, we are ambitious, but don’t need to do it all, so fast. There was just a mismatch there at a certain point that became obvious,” Petersen said.The post Flexport CEO says AI poised for big things in global supply chain appeared first on FreightWaves.',

                        "Cathie Wood has developed a strong following among investors for anticipating digital trends that accelerated early in the pandemic. The Ark Invest chief often takes a contrarian position on stocks, and the exchange-traded funds (ETFs) she manages tend to focus on companies that are creating and spreading disruptive technology.She has been a fan of e-commerce platform operator Shopify (NYSE: SHOP) for a long time, but over the past year, she has been cutting her ETFs' stakes in it. However, Shopify's stock price plunged this month, and Ark Invest is scooping up shares again. Should you follow her lead?Why is Shopify stock dropping?Shopify announced its first-quarter results on May 8. Investors weren't happy, to say the least. The stock is down 26% since the earnings release.There wasn't anything terrible in the report. Revenue increased 23% year over year, and management's outlook for second-quarter sales is in line with Wall Street's expectations, even though it's calling for a slowdown in top-line growth. In Q1, operating income turned positive at $86 million after a $193 million loss in the prior-year period, and adjusted earnings per share came in at $0.20, beating Wall Street's consensus expectation of $0.17.One area that stood out was gross margin guidance. Shopify's gross margin expanded from 47.5% in Q1 2023 to 51.4% last quarter, but management expects it to tighten by about 50 basis points to around 50.9% in the second quarter.So what gives? Most likely, there is intense pressure on Shopify to perform, given its sky-high valuation. Gone are the days when investors were comfortable with paying astronomical valuations for growth stocks. In this market, investors are being much more careful about valuations. Shopify stock was trading at a price-to-sales ratio of 16 earlier this year, and it was still above 13 before the Q1 report. Those are high sales multiples, and it didn't take much being off in the quarterly report to erode the market's willingness to keep supporting them.Plus, Spotify is still not profitable on a GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) basis. A rich valuation combined with less-than-stellar results is a fair setup for a fall.Why is Wood getting enthusiastic again?Shopify is still reliable for double-digit percentage sales growth every quarter, and its profitability is improving steadily. Free cash flow tripled year over year to $232 million in Q1. Among the things that are dragging on its profitability now is the sale of its logistics business, which is still reflected in its financials. However, that sale was the right move to get the company back on track, and the positive results from it will begin to show up soon.Story continuesManagement sees a huge market opportunity for the company, which will allow it to keep up its growth. That should lead to profitability at scale -- something it has already achieved for a time early in the pandemic, when its business accelerated sharply. It has a roadmap to get there, and a whole bunch of growth drivers to help.One of those is its move into physical commerce. Offline gross merchandise volume increased 32% year over year in the first quarter, outpacing overall growth of 23%. Another is business-to-business commerce -- that segment experienced a 130% increase in gross merchandise volume in Q1.In general, management sees tremendous opportunities for the company from a network effect at scale. As it grows, its clients sign up for more services and demonstrate greater payment volume. Its gross payments volume metric represents the share of sales on its platform processed through Shopify Payments, and that accounted for 60% of sales in Q1, up from 56% a year prior. Merchant solutions revenue, mostly associated with gross payments volume, accounted for 74% of the company's total revenue in the quarter.Is Shopify stock really a bargain?Shopify now trades at a price-to-sales ratio of about 10, a valuation that still has a lot of upbeat expectations baked into it. Compare it to other e-commerce stocks like Amazon, Wayfair, MercadoLibre, and Etsy. Even after that sharp price drop, Shopify still looks like an expensive market darling.SHOP PS Ratio ChartThe stakes are high for Shopify, and the company has little margin for error. Even Wood's position in it is much smaller than 13 months ago. In sum, there are things to be excited about here, but the stock is not a buy at this price.Should you invest $1,000 in Shopify right now?Before you buy stock in Shopify, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Shopify wasn’t one of them.

                        "When one of Cathie Wood’s favorite stocks tumbles, the head of Ark Investment Management frequently responds by increasing her position.If you’re an experienced investor, you’ve likely heard of Wood. She may be the country’s most famous money manager after Warren Buffett.Wood (Mama Cathie to her followers) soared to acclaim after a stupendous return of 153% in 2020 and lucid presentations of her investment philosophy in numerous media appearances.Cathie Wood, \"Mama Cathie\" to her devotees, likes young, technology companies.PATRICK T&period; FALLON&sol;AFP via Getty ImagesBut her longer-term performance is less impressive. Wood’s flagship Ark Innovation ETF  (ARKK) , with $6.5 billion in assets, produced annualized returns of 11% for the past 12 months, negative 25% for the past three years and positive 1% for five years.That’s woeful compared with the S&P 500. The index posted positive returns of 29% for one year, 10% for three years, and 15% for five years. Ark Innovation’s numbers also fall well shy of Wood's goal for annual returns of at least 15% over five-year periods.Cathie Wood’s transparent strategyHer investment philosophy is pretty simple. Ark ETFs usually purchase emerging-company stocks in the high-tech categories of artificial intelligence, blockchain, DNA sequencing, energy storage, and robotics. Wood maintains that companies in those categories will change the world.Of course, these stocks are quite volatile, so the Ark funds frequently fluctuate up and down. Wood adds to and subtracts from her top names frequently.Related: Cathie Wood goes bargain hunting in beat-down tech stocksInvestment research titan Morningstar offers a harsh assessment of Wood and Ark Innovation ETF. Investing in young companies with slim earnings “demands forecasting talent, which ARK Investment Management lacks,” Morningstar analyst Robby Greengold wrote in March.The potential of Wood’s five high-tech platforms listed above is “compelling,” he said. “But the firm’s ability to spot winners and manage their myriad risks is less so…. It has not proved it is worth the risks it takes.”This isn’t your father’s investment portfolio. “Wood’s reliance on her instincts to construct the portfolio is a liability,” Greengold said. “The highly correlated stock prices of its holdings belie its apparent diversification across many sectors.”Wood has defended herself from Morningstar’s criticism. “I do know there are companies like that one [Morningstar] that do not understand what we're doing,” she told Magnifi Media by Tifin in 2022.Related: Cathie Wood buys $40 million of wounded tech stock“We do not fit into their style boxes. And I think style boxes will become a thing of the past, as technology blurs the lines between and among sectors.”Story continuesBut some of Wood’s customers apparently agree with Morningstar. During Ark Innovation’s rally of the past 12 months, it suffered a net investment outflow of $2 billion, according to ETF research firm VettaFi.Shopify stock’s sad storyFrom May 13 through May 21, Ark funds snatched 453,523 shares of e-commerce-platform stalwart Shopify  (SHOP) , valued at $25.9 million as of the May 21 close.The Ottawa company helps its merchant clients, mostly small businesses, set up their operations online and in brick-and-mortar locations.The company assists with virtually the entire gamut of business services, including marketing, sales, fulfillment, payment and shipping.Shopify shares have lost 24% since it reported first-quarter earnings May 8. Earnings per share and revenue beat analysts’ expectations for the quarter. But Shopify offered a disappointing forecast for this quarter.Fund manager buys and sells:Druckenmiller forecast Nvidia's rally; now he has a new targetCathie Wood goes bargain hunting in beat-down tech stocksWorld's biggest hedge fund boosts its stake in Nvidia stockIt predicted a slowdown in year-on-year revenue growth, to 19.5% from 23%, for the first quarter. It also sees gross margins narrowing about 0.5 percentage point from the first quarter, thanks to the sale of Shopify’s logistics business.In addition, it expects operating expenses to climb in the low- to mid-single digits percent this quarter from Q1 2024. Analysts had forecast no change in that metric.But Morningstar analyst Dan Romanoff likes the company.“It offers a simple but robust e-commerce platform, with a variety of related add-on functionalities that ultimately converge into a turnkey solution for small and midsize businesses,” he wrote.He puts fair value for the stock at $68. It traded at $57.74 in late Thursday trading.

                        "Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.Cathie Wood, co-founder, CEO, and investment manager of the ARK Invest family of exchange-traded funds, regularly discloses her stock transactions after every trading day.Wood, well-known for her significant returns in 2020, has experienced uneven success in the subsequent years, but she managed another excellent performance in 2024. This year’s challenges have not discouraged her from constantly adjusting her growth stock portfolio.Recently, Wood raised her holdings in Adaptive Biotechnologies (NASDAQ:ADPT), Intellia Therapeutics (NASDAQ:NTLA), and Shopify (NYSE:SHOP). Here is a summary of these stocks, down 16% to 29% in 2024.ShopifyOne of Wood’s holdings, Shopify, was crucial to her successful year in 2024 but is currently experiencing a decline.This year, the e-commerce platform’s shares are down 27% from their peak last year. A recent financial statement did not meet market expectations for future growth, resulting in a 19% decline in stock value despite a 23% revenue rise (29% without the divested logistics sector). Since then, analysts have lowered their price projections for Shopify.Despite this, Shopify has continued to increase its market share and maintain high free-cash-flow margins. Analysts predict 21% revenue growth this year and 20% in 2025, with substantial profitability growth anticipated. Wood and others, including Goldman Sachs, believe the current sell-off is an overreaction and see it as a buying opportunity.Intellia TherapeuticsDespite recently surpassing earnings estimates, Intellia Therapeutics, another key position in ARK’s portfolios, saw a 16% year-to-date decrease in its stock. The company specializes in developing CRISPR-based treatments, with one in the crucial third phase of clinical testing and another nearing that stage. Intellia’s substantial cash reserves provide a solid foundation for its continuous R&D. Wood’s investment reflects her confidence in gene-editing technologies; ARK currently holds $49,253 of Intellia’s shares.Adaptive BiotechnologiesWood also increased her role in the genetic sequencing technology company Adaptive Biotechnologies. Although its stock value fell by 50% this year, Adaptive recently released good financial results, including a higher revenue projection for its minimal residual disease (MRD) business and reduced losses. However, the departure of the CFO soured investor sentiment. Despite this, Wood remains confident in the company's future, and ARK owns more than 7% of its stock.Story continuesThese changes illustrate Wood strategically invests in high-potential growth firms despite market volatility.Protect Your Portfolio with These Alternative Income InvestmentsThere’s growing concern that a recession is near and that could be bad news for a lot of stock portfolios.

                        '(0:30) - How Do You Know When To Sell Your Long-term Investment?(5:30) - Tracey’s Top Stock Picks For Buy and Hold(28:00) - Episode Roundup: AAPL, SBUX, DIS, SQ, TSLA Podcast@Zacks.com Welcome to Episode #370 of the Value Investor Podcast.Every week, Tracey Ryniec, the editor of Zacks Value Investor portfolio, shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks.How long have you held some of your stocks?5-years? 10-years? Or even 20-years?Warren Buffett has famously said the time to sell a stock is never. But even the world’s greatest value investor has sold stocks from the Berkshire portfolio, including the sale of IBM which was for a loss.When Do You Sell? There’s no manual that tells you when to sell. When he sold IBM, Buffett said the business wasn’t performing as he had hoped when he bought it. Recently, Berkshire Hathaway sold a $20 billion chunk of its Apple position. It has owned Apple for 8 years. Buffett claimed the sale was for tax purposes.Basically, investors should ask whether the company’s business is similar to what it was when they bought it. Is the management still excellent? Is there still growth and new products? Is the company in an industry that faces risks that will be difficult to overcome? Does it have a moat?It’s Not All or NothingThat’s another thing all long-term investors should know. You don’t have to sell your entire position. Another option is to sell just a portion of your position and let the rest of it ride in your portfolio. That’s what Buffett did with Apple.5 Popular Buy and Hold Stocks1.       Apple Inc. (AAPL)Apple is one of the most popular stocks among value investors thanks to Warren Buffett gushing about it nearly every year since 2016. But his recent sale of Apple probably did cause some long-term investors to question their own strategy.Apple is expected to grow its earnings by 7.2% in fiscal 2024 and another 9.6% in fiscal 2025. Shares of Apple are up just 9.6% over the last year and are underperforming the S&P 500, which was up 25.7% during the same period.Trading at 29x, Apple is no longer a value stock. Should long-term investors think about taking some profit off on Apple like Buffett did?2.       Starbucks Corp. (SBUX)Starbucks recently had a disappointing quarter. Earnings are only expected to be up 1.4% in fiscal 2024.Shares of Starbucks have fallen 21.6% over the last year but Starbucks isn’t cheap. It still trades with a forward P/E of 22.5.Story continuesTracey has owned Starbucks in her personal portfolio for 10 years. Is it time to cut Starbucks loose?3.       The Walt Disney Co. (DIS)Many parents have bought shares of Walt Disney over the years for their children’s stock portfolio. After all, why not buy what you know?It’s been a rough 5 years for Walt Disney. Shares are down 24.2% during that time while the S&P 500 is up 86.4%. Earnings of Walt Disney are rebounding, however. They are expected to be up 26.6% in fiscal 2024 and another 14.3% in fiscal 2025.Should Walt Disney still be in a parent’s portfolio?4.       Shopify Inc. (SHOP)Shopify was a big pandemic winner, hitting new highs in late 2021. But since, it has sold off. However, Shopify is still up 154% over the last 5 years, which is beating the S&P 500 which is up 86.4%.Shares of Shopify are struggling in 2024, as they have fallen 26% year-to-date. Yet, earnings are on the rebound. Earnings are expected to rise 29.7% in 2024 and another 33.8% in 2025.Should long-term investors have patience with Shopify?5.       Tesla, Inc. (TSLA)Tesla has hit a rough patch in 2024. Shares of Tesla have fallen 30% year-to-date. But long-term investors might barely have noticed as the stock is still up 1570% over the last 5 years.Tesla’s earnings are expected to fall this year, by 20.8%. But analysts expect a rebound in 2025, with earnings forecast to rise 31%.Tesla investors have been known to be patient. Should they continue to be in 2024?What Else Should You Know About Selling a Long-Term Stock Position?

                        "Shopify (SHOP) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this cloud-based commerce company have returned -18.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4% change. The Zacks Internet - Services industry, to which Shopify belongs, has gained 7.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Shopify is expected to post earnings of $0.21 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +50%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1.4%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $0.96 points to a change of +29.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.9%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.28 indicates a change of +33.8% from what Shopify is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.3%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Shopify.Story continuesThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for SHOP _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Shopify, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $2 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +18.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $8.51 billion and $10.15 billion estimates indicate +20.6% and +19.3% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryShopify reported revenues of $1.86 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +23.4%. EPS of $0.20 for the same period compares with $0.01 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.84 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.36%. The EPS surprise was +25%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Shopify is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Shopify. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

                        "Investing in stocks is an effective way to help build and grow your wealth to better prepare yourself for retirement. You should pay special attention to growth stocks, as the capital gains you can enjoy from holding them over the long term can greatly accelerate your path toward financial freedom. Such stocks usually do not pay dividends, as the underlying business is reinvesting all of its profits and cash back into growth initiatives.When it comes to choosing the right growth stocks to own, you should look at several important attributes to help you decide:The company needs to have a strong brand or a competitive edge that allows it to thrive.Its business should enjoy strong tailwinds that can help it grow for the foreseeable future.It should be managed by a competent team that can help it adapt to new trends and stay relevant in a fast-changing business world.Let's look at three such businesses that have these attributes, making their stocks fast growers.Image source: Getty Images.1. AdobeAdobe (NASDAQ: ADBE) is a software provider famous for its portable document format (PDF), which is used by millions worldwide. The company manages multiple software-as-a-service platforms, including Document Cloud which deals with PDF-related services, and Creative Cloud which allows users to conveniently generate images and text with search commands and prompts.Adobe reported stellar earnings for its fiscal 2023 (ending Dec 1, 2023). Revenue rose 10.2% to $19.4 billion, with 94% of that coming from subscriptions. Operating income increased by 9.1% to $6.7 billion, while net income climbed 14.1% to $5.4 billion. The company also demonstrated an impressive track record of free cash flow generation, with the past three fiscal years seeing positive free cash flow of around $7 billion per year.The momentum carried over into the first quarter of fiscal 2024 (ending March 1). Revenue for the quarter rose 11.3% year over year to a new record of $5.2 billion. Adobe booked a $1 billion impairment as part of the termination fee paid to Figma during the quarter, which caused its operating income to tumble by nearly 43% year over year to $907 million. Excluding this charge, Adobe's operating and net income would have improved by 20% and 30% year over year, respectively.The company continues to release new software updates that showcase new advancements along with the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to improve workplace productivity. Last month, the software company released its new Photoshop Beta with a new Generative Fill function that makes it easier for users to generate beautiful AI-influenced images. Earlier this month, Adobe also incorporated its AI Assistant for enterprise customers into its Reader and enterprise software across desktop, mobile, and web. New capabilities enabled by AI can allow workers to be more productive and help them generate insights and write-ups for reports, blogs, and presentations.Story continues2. ZscalerZscaler (NASDAQ: ZS) is a cybersecurity company with an integrated platform that provides cyber and data protection to its customers. Zscaler enjoys strong tailwinds from the digitalization trend powered by the recent pandemic, which pushed many organizations to embrace cloud computing, thereby creating a stronger demand for threat identification and data protection. The company reported a sparkling set of earnings for the first half of fiscal 2024 (ending Jan 31, 2024). Revenue surged by 37.5% year over year to $1 billion, while gross profit improved by 37% year over year to $793 million. On the cash flow front, the cybersecurity firm generated $325.5 million of free cash flow, slightly more than double the $158.4 million churned out in the previous year.Zscaler is also acquiring larger-ticket customers -- customers with more than $1 million in annual recurring revenue jumped 31% year over year to 497 for the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Roughly four out of 10 customers were Fortune 500 companies, providing revenue certainty to the business and a pathway to higher annual recurring revenue should these companies decide to spend more.The company also recently launched its Business Insights add-on to its business analytics portfolio to enable its clients to reduce cyber risks and improve their employee experience. Management is aiming to scale its platform to take on larger customers and increase its annual recurring revenue to $5 billion, or even $10 billion over time, by adding domain experts for specific sectors that can help align with what customers are looking for. Zscaler's current target market comprises 335 million serviceable users, but the company believes that this should increase to more than 600 million potential business-to-business users, giving the firm a $72 billion serviceable market that it can tap into for continued growth.3. ShopifyShopify (NYSE: SHOP) provides a cloud platform with a full suite of tools used by entrepreneurs and small business owners to start and run their retail and online businesses. The company saw a surge in demand for its services as more people started home businesses and side hustles during the pandemic.

Free cash flow for the quarter stood at $232 million, more than doubling year over year from $86 million in the prior period. Gross merchandise volume and gross payment volume saw year-over-year increases of 23% and 31.6%, respectively, to $60.9 billion and $36.2 billion. The business also saw monthly recurring revenue jump 32% year over year to $151 million, aided by higher prices across all of its subscription plans.Shopify also rolled out several product enhancements during the quarter, such as a web performance dashboard along with AI-enabled editing tools embedded within its platform.

                        "On today's episode of Market Domination, Yahoo Finance hosts Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton break down the trading day's biggest stories and latest trends.Nvidia (NVDA) topped earnings expectations and announced a 10-to-1 stock split. Will McGough, Director of Investments at Prime Capital Investment Advisors says the company's AI play \"has huge implications across multiple markets.\" RBC Capital Markets Software Equity Analyst Rishi Jaluria adds, \"80% of CIOs are telling us that they are either currently in production or expect to be in production with AI over the next 12 months, so the appetite is real, the use cases are real.\" Macquarie Head of US AI and Software Research Frederick Havemeyer notes that cybersecurity companies will benefit from the AI race, pointing to CrowdStrike (CRWD), which he believes will see growth as the competition heats up.New housing data reveals that April home sales fell below estimates, declining more than expected: a 1.9% drop month over month. Realtor.com Chief Economist Danielle Hale expects the real estate market and buyer activity to \"ramp up\" with every mortgage rate dip but forecasts a \"slow comeback\" overall.Goldman Sachs upgraded Shopify (SHOP) to Buy from Neutral, raising its price target on the stock to $74 from $67. Meanwhile, Citigroup downgraded Hims & Hers Health (HIMS) to Neutral from Buy and raised its price target to $20 from $16.Buy now, pay later (BNPL) stocks (AFRM, PYPL, SQ) are under pressure after the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau proposed a new rule that would force lenders to adhere to the same consumer protections as credit cards.This post was written by Melanie RiehlVideo TranscriptHello and welcome to market domination.I'm Him that Josh Lift in live from our New York City headquarters.We are giving you the ultimate investing playbook to help tune out the noise and make the right moves for your money here.Your headline blitz getting you up to speed one hour for the closing bell rings on Wall Street.MS. Earnings are very important because in general, if you look at what has been critical to S and P's rise, it's been big tech and MBD is a critical component.Probably the most important component of that subgroup of just six stocks.Nvidia is growing and evolving.Could it have a short term impact on the market here?No question.Do we own it?We own it.Are we staying in it?Yes, NVIDIA is one of those names.I think if you hold it over the next decade, you're going to be very well rewarded while some of the headline numbers were light of what was expected targets clearly making progress.Story continuesIts same store sales was down less this quarter than it was last quarter.Uh Plus it showed progress on its gross margin.We've got one hour to go until the market close.And we're taking a look at the major averages.Although today, I'm actually going to start with the video.We got to get to the major averages in just a moment.But Happy NVIDIA earnings day to those who observe, we have the shares pulling back from the record high where they closed yesterday.We're going to dig much more into NVIDIA, but as we've talked a lot about and we're going to talk more about, the stakes are high with the shares of 90% year to date.So let's get to the major averages here because there's a lot to talk about when it comes to them as well.We are seeing the dow go to the lows of the session here off right now, about 6/10 of 1% the S and P 500 off now about a half 1% as is the NASDAQ, what's going on.It looks like it is the Federal Reserve Minutes which were, were, were released just about an hour ago.That seems to be to blame here in those minutes which were from the meeting that concluded on May 1st.Participants expressed willingness to potentially tighten policy further if we continue to see inflation readings that are not showing much relief.And on top of that, we had Goldman Sachs is David Solomon speaking in comments at Boston College and saying he expects zero rate cuts this year and he says the risk of real and palpable economic slowdown is now big than it was six months ago.Now, stocks perhaps not down more because those Federal Reserve minutes in that discussion occurred before we got the latest CP I report which showed a little bit of relief on the inflation front.So all of that said we are seeing that pull back.I want to get to sectors here real quick within the S and P 500 energy down the most right now, consumer discretionary materials, utilities pretty broad based, sell up.In fact, the only group that is hired right now is health care, Josh Julie, let's get right to it.Invidia.Earnings are just over an hour away.The report where Wall Street has been waiting for, of course, our own Dan Halley is here with what to expect, Dan.Yeah, I think obviously the, the big news here is it's gonna be the, obviously the, the top line and bottom line numbers, but then the, the guidance going forward.And I think, you know, after seeing the massive jumps that we had seen in the prior quarters, uh the, the big news is going to be how did they do this quarter?But then what's happening next quarter?And what does that mean as far as Wall Street's interpretation?Right, because we're gonna start to, to lap last year where everything started to really blow up and we saw these, you know, 100% 200% gains.Right.I think the last quarter, uh, the revenue is around 21.6 billion something, uh, in, in that area, uh, nearly for that one quarter, nearly the entire revenue of the year prior in one quarter.So we're gonna have to what, what that means for this quarter and then moving forward those comps, what that looks like and how Wall Street responds to that.Are you gonna say?Well, look, you're not doing 300% growth.I don't know what to tell you.You know, we're out or are they gonna say?Ok, you're still the odds on leader in A I.And frankly, they are still with, with the hardware that they have to offer as well as the, the software mode that they have.Now something you and I have been talking a little bit about is what these chips are being used for within A I.And there's sort of two phases of A I that are important.There is the training and this is something I think we talked about a little bit yesterday, the training where you're building these large language models in the generative A I, right where they're learning, then once you get them trained, then you have inference where they actually start working, they start making connections.I'm saying it like it's a brain but we, we uh you know, who was it?Who said this week, we don't wanna anthropomorphize them too much.Was it, Sata Adella, who said that in any case where they start making forecasts and making uh thinking for lack of a better word, right?So the thing is to sort of figure out where NVIDIA fits in, it fits into the training, we know that and then what happens?Yeah, I mean, look the the the training is, is really the the heavy duty processing that, that these companies need these chips for.If you're gonna be training, you're, you, you need that kind of hardcore performance infer, you still need that performance but not as much.The the the the the data heavy side of training requires these big chips.But you can use less powerful, more efficient chips for infer incing itself.That's not to say that you can just like pop out a laptop chip from like, you know, my Macbook and start Infer.That's crazy, but it, it doesn't need to be these kinds of heavy duty Invidia chips.And so I think the, the, as we start to see companies go from training to infer, what does that then mean for NVIDIA overall?Does that mean that companies will start opting for less powerful and more efficient chips so that they're not consuming as much and as much energy and not paying as much when they uh sign on with cloud providers.That's a question that that is really important for NVIDIA to answer.Let me see, we were talking to Dan Niles on the show, you know, smart guy, long time tech investor and, and NVIDIA fan.And we asked Dan, you know that when you're talking to your clients and they wanna ask you about downside risk, what do you tell them?He, he named a few different points but then he said something that, you know, he said one risk he talks to his clients about is how, you know, yes, it's a chip giant but the real secret sauce is the software.That's what's locking the customers into the silicone.And his point being, of course, there's the efforts to develop these, you know, open source alternatives.And II, I don't Dan, I did not see that as a near even intermediate term risk, but how do you see it?I think that that is something that a lot of companies are keeping in mind.And so I think it's, it's important to, you can look at it almost from how the cloud evolved over time, right?When the cloud computing really started taking off initially, it was, well, let's sign up for a cloud provider, right?And then you saw a company say, I don't wanna get locked in with one guy that's just not good for me, that's not good for competition.Uh My clients might want something else uh customers might, might not wanna pay for this particular client or maybe I don't wanna have all my data relying uh sitting in this one place.Maybe I wanna have, you know, uh it on uh another provider.So now you have what's called a multi cloud strategy, right?It just makes more sense to, to disperse your, your data across different areas.And so I think you can kind of look at it in that same way where you initially go.OK. We have these NVIDIA chips.They're great.You're seeing the, the hyper scalar, the Microsoft, the Googles, the Amazons, uh they spread out, right?They have their own chips now that they're, they're building their own training and infer chips.Uh they have NVIDIA, they have a MD.Uh I'm sure they're using Intel as well at, at some point.But I, I think that the, the effort is going to be this, this more open source idea.And yeah, C A is uh the, the, the software mode, right?Once you build on CU A, you're building the software for that particular architecture.And so now there's ideas of, well, how can other companies maybe open that up so that you don't have to just rely on C A, you can get beyond that chips that can work with C A even um just quickly, a little perspective, a pause for some perspective.Here, we have two pie charts because we were looking a few years back 2021 at what the revenue breakdown looked like for NVIDIA at that time.And by the way, uh NVIDIA was the Yahoo Finance Committee of the year back in 20 16.But this revenue under $17 billion and gaming was still 46.5% of the revenue, 40% was data center.Fast forward to 2024.The or, and fiscal 2025 for the company.But um or fiscal actual 2023 fiscal 2024 excuse me, revenue, $61 billion.70 8% of that data center.And it's not that, that the gaming side is, is losing.I mean, maybe during that period, the, the 2021 where we saw the spike with, with uh COVID people going out and purchasing cards.And then we also saw the uh the crypto kind of surge was, was going hard at that point, people buying those up.Uh and then on the secondary market, they were selling for like, you know, $1500 when I mean, I'm a gamer, I couldn't get that man.Um But yeah, and then you, you, you look at how it's kind of changed to now where the gaming side is, it's cooled off a little bit.People still are buying those chips though.It's still the, the I mean, look, if you look at a breakdown between NVIDIA A MD and other uh when it comes to dedicated chips, NVIDIA crushes everything, right?So it's not as though gaming isn't an important business for them.It's just that the data center has exploded.It's not that the others aren't growing.It's that, that is growing so much more.Dan, we're gonna check in with you again.Thanks so much.Appreciate it.Although expectations for Nvidia's first quarter results are high.Once again, topping those estimates has not necessarily translated into big stock moves in recent quarters, Josh Schafer is here with more on that as the bogey's gotten a little bit tougher, right?I, I'm, I'm totally mixing my sports metaphors there, but it's gotten harder to beat, uh, whatever, whatever that, that's a metaphor, we know a forever, right?But for NVIDIA, really, the last couple quarters, we've seen that beating and raising as they have been doing hasn't always necessarily meant that the stock pops like most stocks pop in that scenario.So what you're looking at here is the implied options or the implied move for the stock after earnings.Uh, according to options, this is from the Friday going into earnings that's in purple.The blue is the actual earnings reaction.So today, we're looking at perhaps an 8.5% move closer to 9% move now per options.But when you look at these blue and purple lines, you see, they don't actually line up that much.So, really the broad takeaway here is what the expectations were going into the report don't quite matter that much once we get to about 415 this afternoon and it hasn't really been that accurate.In other words, we have no idea.We have no idea.And then the other takeaway from this graph is that in Q two and Q three of last year NVIDIA did beat and raise and the stock didn't even go up.Right.And that is something that could very well be a reality tonight into tomorrow.Right.The stock is at an all time high right now, or just off an all time high and up, over 90% going into the print.It's always something I think just important as investors to keep in mind when you're kind of staring at your screen later tonight, or maybe tomorrow morning and you read the commentary and it all, it all could seem relatively positive, but the stock isn't in the green.Well, maybe there was just a massive rally reading into the reading into the print and it's just not enough to move a stock that has rallied over 200% over the last year.It's something we've seen on earnings over the last couple of quarters.We're gonna find out.What about the broader market, Josh?Yeah, it's gonna be interesting to see what happens with NVIDIA in terms of the broader market, right?So we know obviously it is a large portion of the S and P 500 at this point, the NASDAQ 100 many of the major indexes and it is able to move those indexes quite significantly.So we were looking at your screen here is just simply the weighting of the company in the S and P 500 it's about 5% of the S and P 500/6 percent of the NASDAQ 100 so on and so forth there.So essentially, if you see a big move in this stock tomorrow, it might also mean that you're why you're seeing a move in the major indexes.And that's not even really getting into the fact that we know if NVIDIA says something about A I demand, that means X or Y for chips as well, right?So if they're saying positive and now for utilities, maybe for hyper scalars like there, it could be very broad.And I think that's the main thing I'm interested to see tomorrow.As you just mentioned, Julie is sort of the utilities, energy trade and that real A I broadening that we've had does that now trade on NVIDIA earnings too.I don't know, but it certainly could to some extent, right?And it's gonna be interesting to me, something to watch in the market action tomorrow.Find out it'll be fun.It will be fun.Thanks Josh and be sure to tune into young finance tonight and tomorrow, Dan Halley and I will be speaking with NVIDIA, Ceo Jensen Huang after the earnings call.So you don't want to miss his comments, stocks near the lows of the day as investors wait for the results of Nvidia's first quarter earnings.It's coming up after the bell, expectations we know are high for the tech giant and the stocks move this year accounts for a quarter of the S and P five hundred's gain according to Deutsche Bank.Joining us now is Will mcgough Director of Investment at prime capital Investment Advisors.Will good, see you.Thanks for having us.So let's let's maybe start there.Will NVIDIA after the bell today.What are you expecting?What does it mean for the market?I just wanna know who's not talking about NVIDIA.I've been in New York, New York for a couple of days and all of our meetings A I is the buzzword.So it's uh all eyes are on NVIDIA today as you just showed Josh, it's gonna drive the market with 5% weight in the S and P I don't specifically run our stock portfolios.I'm a multi asset guy, but our P MS are looking at operating earnings.They're trying to see if competition is gonna drip in a little bit, take away a little bit of market share.And so that's what our guys are looking at.Of course, we own NVIDIA like everybody else and we'll be observing just like everybody else.Well, and how are you thinking about it or are you thinking about it from a macro perspective?Right?Not just Invidia specifically, but the whole A I play, it's as, as you just mentioned with utilities, it's coming down.Utilities is like a two or 3% waiting sector of the S and P A lot of folks think it's old economy getting bid up with utilities, but it's really a tech driven uh buzz move here.So I think it's uh got huge implications across the economy.It's uh could command multiples higher.Uh you know, for example, last year it was no earnings growth.It was all multiple expansion earnings seasons coming through this year with multiple saying about the same.So could we enter a period where multiples could be rationally viewed higher when everybody else thinks they should come back towards average because of A I I think that's something that investors need to think about.Well, do you, when you think about NVIDIA, do you think about it now?And do your P MS think about it as kind of a gauge, a broader barometer rather than just, you know, does it say something more than just about NVIDIA itself at this point?For sure, you have to think about trends and A I is a trend is driving speculation.What could be market breath with small cap sos getting built up.It could be A I with large cap growth max seven.Uh the US economy of stock market is like a super tanker.It takes a while for these trends to percolate.They go on for a while and it takes a while for a new trend to develop.So you have to be aware of these trends in the market to ultimately position your portfolios.Speaking of trends, what is the inflation trend?That is the other big question right now that's gotten overshadowed by NVIDIA.We got a little bit of a hint of it in the Fed minutes where participants said, well, maybe we are gonna need to tighten more.The market seems to be sort of shrugging that.I mean, how did you read those comments?They were a little dated.I mean, I, I casually checked in on it before I was coming here to prep and it was more hawkish than I expected as you would.Most investors in its markets down a little bit today because of it.Uh The Fed likes to float speakers that have different theories out there to see how the market may react to cuts or no cuts.And we're kind of in a camp where we may see the unexpected of a hike if this rate, you know, inflation, Jay Powell told you, he, he basically took that off the table.We could see it.I mean, that's what's gonna happen if inflation stick here and rates stay higher, which I think is a good thing.Ultimately, if you have a higher rate environment, we haven't seen it and gosh knows how long.Uh so we can kind of get back to the old regime from like the sixties and seventies where you've got competition for capital with debt investors and equity investors it is healthy.We deal with a lot of retirement investors.So having cash rates higher is a good thing.Uh capital market assumptions increase higher when rates are when risk free is higher too.So I think higher rates are good.We're just uh conditioned to a bias of a low rate environment that's changing.And a lot of folks have grown up in this industry with low rates and that's all they.Yeah.So we have to see how that's going to affect, you know, cyclical and secular trends going forward too.But that said, I think, you know, mcdonald's has come out with the value meal target's gonna reduce prices on 3000 items or something like that.So we could be at peak inflation uh peak rate move.Um And we could just be talking about all this could just be a whole bunch of nothing.You know, the old adage sell in May and go away.I think it's a good strategy this year.It's uh we got all this news baked in markets should just settle down over the summer.Enjoy your summer break because when we come back in the fall, we got an election.So all that volatility I'm taking off for the summer.Well, thank you.Appreciate the, the green light on that.Thanks so much for being here.Appreciate it.We're just getting started here on market domination coming up.Shares of target are seeking today after it missed on earnings.We'll check in on the retail giant and a few other trending tickers on the other side.And at 430 Eastern time, it's the latest edition of our new show.Asking for trend.We dive into the latest numbers from NVIDIA and breaking down the moves that will be affecting your money and be sure to tune into Yahoo Finance tonight and tomorrow, Dan Halley and I will be speaking with NVIDIA, Ceo Jensen Wong after the earnings call.Stay tuned.We've got more market coverage after this.Let's get to some trending tickers.First up, target shares of the retail giant are sinking after a target missed on earnings.It also issued a forecast for the current quarter.Well below expectations, target shares have lost nearly half of their value since touching an all time high back in November of 2021.They are up this year um before today, they were up by about 9%.Although obviously they have cut that, but the stock is down the most in November 2022 today after they reported comps fell 3.7%.That is uh comparable store sales um which was the fourth straight quarter of decline.Yeah.So the stock taking a big hit.What are bulls saying today?Julie?Well, D A Davidson's Mike Baker got a buy ring.Here's what he told his clients bottom line is that the best print he said, you know, you gotta acknowledge that but largely is basically in line thinking, this is not uh justifying the kind of sell off we're seeing for stock trading at a below average.Multiple.In other words, he thinks it's attractively valued here with comps poised to turn positive.He said margins are still improving.We think this makes for a buying opportunity.He reiterated his buy rating.That's interesting.I mean, even uh Simeon Gutman over at Morgan Stanley who also is an over has an overweight rating.He was used about the increase in SGN a sales general administrative costs at the company.And that was a head scratcher for some of the other analysts as well.And then on top of that, you have traffic and average transaction falling 1.9% last quarter, which was really something that uh analysts said was concerning, you know, they saw a drop in home goods and furniture and apparel and food.So, you know, there's, it's the this current quarter could see an uptick, but we'll have to see if that guy I spoke to Mike Baker over D A Davidson.He kind of made the comparison.He said, you know, he buys on both likes Walmart, but he's like, listen, they are best in Breed firing in all cylinders.Target turnaround story.You know, you're the believer you don't.Finally our next trending ticker.Let's check out Lulu Lemon here shares falling as much as 7%.They found the news that its chief product officer to cho is leaving.So that was, that was the news, you know, chief product Officer leaves.It does not sound uh really like she's getting replaced.Apparently the responsibilities.It sounds like it said, gonna kinda getting shifted to other colleagues.And I did see some analysts who cover the company quote as saying this news just kind of added to these broader worries.They had this means for the sales weakness.In other words, people reading into it, you know what I'm worried about the belt bag.Are you familiar with the belt bag?Ok.It's a fan is what we used to call Fanny pack.And then it got like a 20 twenties makeover and now it's called a belt bag and you don't always wear it around your waist.Sometimes you wear it around.Ok?I have two Lulu and belt bags.I read in one of these notes today or one of the commentaries, the belt bag might be going out.Really?Lemon's belt bag.I like my belt bags.I don't wanna get rid of my belt bags.The Fanny pack has made a big comeback.I gotta tell you.There's all I really, yeah, it's a whole thing.I might have to switch to my daddy Dover.I have too many of these things clearly, but my point there is a bigger point here.It's not just about my own personal what I'm carrying around my stuff in, but that, that is little lemon losing some of that cachet is kind of the bigger question here.Remember we talked to Adrian Yee, um who talked of Barclays, who talked about that the wide leg denim trend was hurting Lulu.I remember that uh conversation with her and she said that this was sort of an incrementally negative data point that this uh executive was leaving.They do report uh Q one result coming up, June 5th.So hoping to get a little more insight and guidance that time and analysts are looking for the smallest same store sales growth that we've seen in quite some time for the company.Finally, we're taking a look at some buy now, pay later stocks, a firm paypal block, they're all lower.Today, after the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau proposed a new rule that would force the lenders to adhere to the same consumer protections as credit cards.So it was sort of an interpretation of existing rules and laws that would create more parallels between credit card companies and some of these companies.In other words, you know, that they would have to, I don't know, adhere to some more stringent standards, although a credit card company has to assess a borrower's ability to repay.They're not suggesting that the B NPL companies will have to do that.It's interesting.It's not surprising maybe Juliette, you see regulators at least kicking the tires more and more because B NPL has grown.So I mean, just it just as an industry.So this big jump and usage as e commerce just exploded during the pandemic and now others have jumped in.I mean, how many big banks even offering these, you know, pay overtime products?So maybe not too surprised to see, you know, Washington at least taking harder looks and in firm for its part said uh in an email to Yahoo Finance that they've already disclosed that the CFP B already oversees some parts of their business and they're gonna continue to work with them.So we'll see how it ends up affecting them.Well, new data on existing home sales for April out today, that number declining for the second straight month to an annual rate of 4.14 million.Yet the median price of an existing home sold rose by 5.7% year over year, just over $400,000.Joining us now, realtor.com, chief economist Dan Yell Hale Danielle, it's good to see you.So as we look at these numbers and this continued weakness, can we mostly point the finger at, at mortgage rates which have not come down?Yeah, I think mortgage rates and the resulting lack of affordability in the housing market is a key culprit behind this disappointing print today, I should say somewhat disappointing print.So 3.14 million, I'm sorry, 4.14 million.A modest decline from last month.Home sales have been at this relatively low 4 million plus level for the past several months.They're really kind of struggling to out of here because there are some significant challenges in the housing market, not just higher mortgage rates, but also home prices that hit a new high for this time of year and continue to present affordability challenges.In order to really make some headway against these challenges, we're going to need to see more building.The housing market continues to be short on supply even though we did see some optimistic numbers, some signs of improving supply.We're still not at a point where supply is ample enough uh, to help cool off home price growth.Danielle, let's stick with mortgage rates for a second because I, I'm on mortgage news daily here.They're telling me the 30 year fixed Danielle 7.09%.I'm interested where you think that is, you know, six months from now, Danielle, 12 months from now.And what's, you know, what's the rate that we need to see to really jump start greater activity, Danielle, you know, do you, do you think it's 6.5, 6 lower?Well, when you look at outstanding mortgage debt, 90% of it right now is under 6% and about two thirds of it is under 4%.So for existing homeowners who are, you know, maybe reasonably happy with their home but ready to make a trade either up or down or to something different uh it is really expensive to try to get a mortgage at a 7% rate compared to their current rate.90% some of them are under six and two thirds are under 4%.So it makes it a lot more expensive to move.The closer we get back to uh to those numbers, I think the more we're going to see housing activity ramp up and every drop in mortgage rates brings some potential buyers and likely sellers as well back to the housing market.So every little step down is going to help.But you know, I think we're not going to get to levels where we're going to see a jumpstart in housing activity.I think it's going to be more of a of uh a trickle or a slow comeback in housing activity as those mortgage rates come down.Danielle, I'm really curious about the new home market versus the existing home market, right?The existing home market much bigger to be sure, but we are not seeing the same kind of pricing pressure in the new home market.You know, we're seeing incentives still be offered because the home builders wanna move those homes.So if people are looking right now is new, are new homes actually more affordable on a relative basis, they're not necessarily more affordable on a, you know, an absolute price basis.But I think new homes are definitely an area that consumers should explore, especially if they're in a region like the South where builders have been really active.Parts of the Southwest.Builders remain active.And so, you know, builders don't have a low existing mortgage rate that they are tied into.And so they have continued to build and create inventory is available for buyers.They also are, you know, they're a business and so they're very pragmatic when looking at the market, if they need to make incentives in order to make a home purchase affordable for buyers, they have shown a willingness to do so whether that's cutting asking prices or offering mortgage rate, buy downs either temporary or longer term.And so as a result, if consumers are shopping and they see, you know, if they haven't considered new homes, it does make sense to consider them new homes right now because uh builders have done a good job of keeping up their pace of activity represent about 30% of the market of homes for sale.So it is likely that consumers are going to have new homes as an option to consider and perhaps more so than they can find in the existing home market today.All right, Danielle always appreciate having you on the show.Thanks so much for joining us.Absolutely.Coming up, we're playing ball in the latest edition of our series.Goodbye or goodbye.Find out which sports media stock to be a home run for your portfolio.Stay tuned, more market domination after this, please.It's a big noisy universe of stocks out there.Welcome to.Goodbye or goodbye.Our goal to help cut through that noise to navigate the best moves for your portfolio.Today, we're taking a look at sports media stocks in a match up between one intellectual property owner and a distributor.What's the best way to play it right now?I'm here with Chris Moran CO cio at the be fun.Thanks so much for being here.Appreciate it.So let's get your by stock and it is Atlanta Braves.Now, this is an interesting one.You were interestingly enough, not the first person who has talked to us about this stock, but it is not one that's widely held or that is as much talked about within the sort of media space.The shares are down over the past year, about 8.5%.But if you look at it, you talk about the loyalty that people have right to something like the Atlanta Braves.Sure.I know everybody wants to talk about A I today with, this is in many ways the anti A I play.This is in person.This is 100 and 50 year old company.It's the oldest continuously operating sports franchise in North America.The Atlanta Braves, there are very few opportunities to own sports assets in the public markets.This is one of them.And as you talk about owning sports in the public markets here, you we have seen in the private markets that there's been a lot of growth.So this shows here on this chart, the NFL and where we've seen that growth, the NBA, the MLB, the NHL and the compound annual growth rate altogether 16%.So in the private markets, we have seen that growth, sports assets have appreciated actually greater than the S and P over this time frame.Uh They've been great stores of value for lots of reasons um that we'll talk about but uh there again, very few ways to participate.Yeah, there aren't very many ways to participate.So what's interesting is that you say that the Atlanta Braves are, are treating any discount to that private market value, which is sort of counterintuitive.Well, so we, you know, first you start with what, what the private market value is.First, we, we calculate the private market value of the team based on where other uh sports teams have transacted in the market over the last 10 or 20 years.And we have a look at that.Actually, these are some of the recent cops uh in, in various leagues.Um The Phillies are the most relevant.Um They sold a minority stake for seven times revenue.We value the Braves at something like 5.5 or six times revenue.You add the value of the real estate which they have around the park and you get to a value of something like 3.5 billion for the company divided by the 62 million shares.And uh you get to a stock price in the high fifties versus 40 today.Ok. Got you.So that is a, a considerable discount.And it is illustrative to see, you know, the Phillies valued it at $2.8 billion.And then you have to ask with seeing those valuations kind of as the result of deals and knowing how much people are willing to pay for them.It has to lead you to ask, could we see a deal with the Braves?Right.So there's been a persistent discount in other sports assets.This is a little bit different because this asset is controlled by John Malone and the folks at Liberty media who split it off uh just about a year ago in July, uh in my view as a uh to position it for sale to a private who can capture that trophy value and close the discount to private market value.Would we potentially see a sale of part of it or do you think it's more likely you sell, you sell the entirety of the public company?Got you.So we always talk about what a risk could be potentially.And in this way, you say boredom is kind of a risk.In other words, like if you no catalyst, you go kind of muddle along without a deal or something else happening.I use boredom in particular because a lot of people find baseball boring.It's not gotten more exciting with some of the rule changes.But yeah, listen, there's not a lot of downside in my view to the private market value of this franchise.It's not like it's gonna get technologically disintermediated or they're gonna fall on their face in terms of earnings.Really.It's just a matter of the discount persisting for a very long period of time because there's not a transaction to surface the value.Do you happen to be a Braves fan?Also, I am not a Braves fan.I am a New York Yankees fan.I was gonna say your accent implies you would be more a Northern uh fan than an Atlanta Braves fan.And you guys do own Atlanta Braves and your portfolios.Our clients are actually the larger shareholders of this company.Ok.There you go.So let's talk about the stock.You don't like.This one is interesting.It's Disney now these years are up over the past year.There's been a lot going on with Disney.Obviously, the first reason you say you call it analog dollars for digital dimes.What do you mean by that?So first of all, let me preface this by saying before I get all the dis nerds out there.Uh Mad at me, Disney has fantastic intellectual property and is run by a very great leader in Bob Tiger, but it's still not immune to the forces impacting the media industry and and I started as a media analyst 20 years ago and I'm very familiar with those and, and that's basically this um concept that media companies were over earning for decades in the old big pay TV bundle system that has come apart with streaming.And uh it means that the companies are gonna earn less going forward.And Disney's done a pretty good job of, of transitioning their business to direct to consumer, but it's never gonna be as good it once was and still has some challenges in the immediate term.And you also, when you also say analog dollars for digital dimes is that, you know, they do have an analog business also in the form of the parks, but they're also investing all this money and trying to make streaming sort of work.Yeah.And this and the parks business is more than half of the IDA, more than half of the cash flow of this company and, and more than half of the value too.But we still like that business on a secular basis.The experiential economy is one we've uh been a proponent of it actually.Um it works for the Braves as well, but that one actually has some cyclical challenges coming up.Yeah.And let's talk about that, the economic sensitivity and those, those parks are not getting any less expensive, that is for sure for those of us with Children who've been there recently and uh you know, both both Comcast which owns the Universal Parks.And Disney have called out a moderating demand this summer in their, in their parks just as we get through COVID normalization and, and frankly, as the consumer is a little bit strained and can't spend as much.And then we showed that stock chart at the beginning where the stock is appreciated, something like 18.5% over the past year.And as I said, there's a lot that's been going on, namely a big proxy fight, right?That has helped in part drive the shares up.What now?Yeah, exactly.That's sort of the issue is that, you know, a lot of the catalysts are in the rearview mirror, whether it's the, the try and proxy battle that, that you referenced, uh taking costs out, um getting the DTC business, the direct to consumer business to profit, neutral, profitability, which they've all done and check, check those boxes.And that's why the stock has done well from here.It's gonna be more difficult trading out of, call it a 20 times kind of uh multiple slight premium to the market.Uh And there's just not a lot of enough of margin of safety for us to continue owning it.Ok.So let's talk about what then could go, right?That would maybe change your view, you know, if they do have good assets, they do still have Bob Iger in there.We don't know what's happening after Bob Iger, but you know, he could turn the ship from here.It's largely an execution story.And if they over execute, if they take more costs out, if they get direct to consumer uh right, faster than we think they will, the other side is gonna continue to dwell.The other thing I'd mention is this is an industry that's undergoing consolidation.You've got paramount subject of a takeover battle.Warner Brothers.Discovery could be another one.I don't think it's likely that anybody buys Disney, but there have been whispers of Apple for example, being interested again.I don't think that's likely but it's, it's not a nonzero chance and that is a risk to the upside.Now, you said you wouldn't want to own Disney or do you guys have some Disney?You've owned Disney in the past?We've been saying goodbye to it.Interesting.Ok.But you still have a little bit but you're, you're working it and we're very tech sensitive.So we have clients with very low basis.Understood.Chris, thank you so much.Let's let's summarize what you're telling folks here.You say you would buy Atlanta braves holdings based on a significant discount to sport teams, private market value.On the other side, you think avoid Disney amid the decline of traditional media and lack of catalyst going forward.Chris Mirani, good to see you.Thanks for coming in and thank you so much for watching.Goodbye or goodbye.We'll be bringing you new episodes three times a week at 330 pm Eastern time for some calls of the day, Goldman Sachs upgrading Shopify today to buy it from neutral and raising its price target to $74 up from 67.So, you know, this stock is interesting.It's been under some pressure.It's down more than 20% so far this year.Goldman says though, ok, that is an opportunity because they say yes, there's an investment cycle weighing on margins, more mixed consumer spending.We know that's been weighing on the stock.But they tell their clients, you stick with this because Shopify has significant technology mode in e commerce, software share gain across e commerce cycles.They point out bottom line that's gonna drive.Goldman says durable growth at scale.Goldman does point out some risk.But bottom line, they say this one is a buy to their clients.Yeah, and the stock is down like 25% year to date.So they're looking at it and seeing all of that that is perhaps priced in and not justified given that.Um and they talk about the, the company has been in investing in what they call large adjacency.In other words, you know, sort of bolt on technology, things that are adjacent to their business that will be a creative over time.And that's also one of the reasons uh that they like the stock.Yeah, there are some downside risks.They point out, listen, they say consumer spending could be worse.That would, that would pressure GMV shares in Ecommerce could be a impact.They said by kind of aggressive investment from companies rivals.That's Amazon Temu, but that is not their base case here that they're buyers.Um And then we got him and hers to talk about also Hims and hers being downgraded over at Citigroup to neutral from buy.But the analysts are also raising their price circuit from $16 to $20.The stock is down 7%.I have to say this is one of the more effusive downgrades that I have seen here because the analysts, they're still like him and hers over the long term, they talk about the, the recent announcement that the company is going to be selling G LP ones through their site and they say assuming an average monthly average selling price of $230 a month, this equates to an almost comically large $30 billion revenue opportunity.I love that, but the stock has rallied a lot.So that's basically why they're saying they would take a policy.That's it.After the announcement.They say listen, the stock jumped 20% added about 760 of enterprise value, leaves little room for upside in their opinion.They say given the significant uncertainties around the economics and durability of G LP ones, we are moving to the sidelines indeed.And so are other investors today to some extent?Well, coming up, we'll bring you down the best ways to position in your software, your portfolio in the software space after some key announcements in the sector in recent weeks, stay tuned for the Yahoo Finance playbook.On the other side, Microsoft is going all in on A I.The company this week announced a new category of P CS called Copilot plus their computers equipped with so called A I PC chips and will now run on open A is GP T +40 model.So as software technology continues to advance, we're looking at how to navigate the big picture and the best ways to position your portfolio with the Yahoo Finance playbook.Let's welcome in Rishi, Juria R BC capital Market, software equity analyst, as well as Frederick Havemeyer, the head of USA I and software research at Macquarie.Gentlemen, thank you so much for being here.I guess.Let's start, first of all with the Microsoft announcement itself and sort of how we should think about it as investors, how big of a deal it will be, how incrementally um it will add to revenue, etcetera.R. I'll start with you.Yeah, absolutely.And thanks so much for having us.We were just out in Seattle at Microsoft build this week and look, I think the introduction of these A IP CS is actually going to be a really big game changer to getting generative A I in the hands of every knowledge worker out there.Right.Recall when you use any sort of GP T system today, it requires a fast internet connection, a lot of computing power.Now, you know, it's going, it's going to take time to, you know, they get light enough that, that everyone can use them, but you'll be able to use some of these more small language and medium language models locally without a super fast internet connection.And so that I think will enable a lot more kind of general purpose.Uh A I use cases and workloads that previously didn't exist.So I do think this is a very exciting announcement for Microsoft, Fred.Let's bring you in here as well.Same question, Fred.So you know your reaction to that Microsoft event, you know Rishi says these new A IP CS game changer, Fred, do you agree?So for the past year, we've been making the call consistently that A I is going to have to move to the edge, it's gonna have to move to the device.And in many cases, this does require hardware like what Microsoft is rolling out to do it.And it's what would get us excited both about making this successful to consumers and knowledge workers plus also being able to drive uptake of A I in a profitable way.Because if you recall, I think one of the last time I was on Yahoo Finance, we had a great time talking about what smaller language models mean large language models still quite large but nevertheless smaller mean to uh margins.And as we found we explored in the past, we think that achieving uh 80% to 90% plus gross margins with running generative A I models can be done by using small language models on specialized hardware or on local devices.So I think quite exciting, Fred, just follow up on that, you wrote a recent note about how consumers are gonna determine the impact here.And I keep trying to figure out if where we are in the A I cycle is still um push or it's starting to be pull.In other words, like all this stuff is coming out are customers particularly on the retail side asking for this or these companies still at the face where they have to convince them that they want it.I think that when we look at products out there like chat G BT, I think we already see that there are north of 100 million users that I would qualify in many cases as consumers really interested in these types of products.Now commercializing it and making it something that's useful and interesting for consumers.I do think that there are technologies out there that have been perhaps what you describe as a solution in search of a problem.And at the same time, I do think that it's very clear to us that the technology of generative A I model of large language models is something that we find fit with consumers over time chat GP T did.And I think that with the right interface and the right uh platform, we'll find it over time.I mean, I'm a user of Meta's Rayban glasses, not here to discuss meta but just the glasses.They're fascinating.They're really good.And I really enjoy having this like modality of working with, with these A I models sitting right in my glasses.So we'll see over time, Rishi.Same question.I mean, when you look across uh your your coverage universe Richie, what, what kind of customer adoption and engagement are you seeing when it comes to, you know, these new A I products and features?Yeah.Um A absolutely.And I'm glad you have me alongside Fred because I, I definitely agree with him on a lot of what he's saying.Uh Look the, the what what I would say is when we're talking to companies, we're talking to Cio S CTO S heads of it.There is real appetite for A I usage within the enterprise.Um A lot of this, I would say maybe 70% of it is actually net new budget.So it's not even cannibalizing other parts of it.It's coming out from other parts of the organization.Um So there's real money being earmarked.Uh We're, we're, we're seeing uh I'd say 80% of Cio S are telling us that they are either currently in production or expect to be in production with A I over the next 12 months.So the appetite is real, the use cases are real.And remember we're still at very, very early stages of this.If I draw the analogy to the internet stages, you know, even though GP T four, incredibly powerful, this is probably 14 4 dial up level, right?We haven't even reached the high speed broadband.So I think there's still a lot more way for the technology to advance from here, but already seeing real interest from the enterprise and from consumers as well.So we know you guys both like Microsoft, even before this latest event, you guys both have outperform ratings on that one.Fred with you, I wanna dig into a couple others because you like a couple of the cyber security names including crowd strike and we recently heard from Palo Alto that seemed to make uh investors a little uncomfortable here.Do you think uh the likes of a crowd strike are gonna benefit from A I as to how it relates to cyber security or is it just a more general cybersecurity play?So we do think that it relates like crowd is really benefiting.I think from generative A I as a trend while they're not selling generative A I themselves, we think that the advent of generative A I is making it much easier for Attackers to exploit a lot of things like for example, fishing attacks are becoming far more sophisticated uh Attackers that want to build software are getting also just power ups now being able to use generative A I perhaps to actually build malware more effectively.We think that Crowdstrike which protects the endpoint, it protects the device as the last line of defense against all those attacks that have penetrated every other of security is really well positioned to defend against the brand new unknown threats that we think are likely to emerge with the advent of generative A I.So really like crowdstrike is our top pick for just overall trend based exposure to generative A I in the cybersecurity sector.Rishi 11 name I'm interested in.So you got Apple forms on Microsoft Crm.So, Fanella and Benioff, you also Richie like Zoom uh which has been a tough slog, you know, in the red richie year to date over the past 12 months.Why is Zoom A buy here?Yeah, I think Zoom has a really interesting play when it comes to A I.There is so much unstructured data when you think about video and audio even, you know, non verbal communication that I think Zoom has a really interesting road map.I think the hiring of actually from uh Microsoft was, was a great one and I really like that kind of thought leadership m uh sorry Zoom has put out on having a Federated A I approach.Um You think about things like sales coaching that uh it can tell sales people look, you're not making eye contact, stop wandering and make eye contact with your prospective customer.Uh hr when you're doing interviews with people, hey, this body language suggests that uh um the, you know, prospective employee might be wrong or, or lying, maybe problem with one or two follow up question.Um And I think about those use cases, maybe even vertical them for the contact center where contact center Zoom has been getting a great amount of success.I think Zoom is very much an underappreciated A I play in my book and I love that it will help you be more human or interact better with other humans.That's a sort of a fascinating offshoot of all of this.You got 11 other one, you guys both like is sales force and Michelle take you quickly on this and then we'll get Fred's opinion on on why you think it is gonna benefit here.I mean, that stock has also had some exogenous things going on, activist pressure, et cetera.Yeah.Um I I will say my uh bullishness on sales force is more related to the self help element of the story.I think there's a lot of margin expansion from here.Um There's a lot more cost cutting, they can do a lot more efficiencies they can bring to the organization.So the stock feels very much undervalued in my book.And I think there's upside to numbers and upside to the multiple from an A I perspective.I, I will say maybe I'm a little counter consensus on this.I want to see more out of sales force when it comes to A I, in theory, they could be a huge beneficiary.They're a system of record uh sales, people, marketing, people all rely on a day in day out and it's a huge platform with this massive ecosystem, but I just haven't seen enough innovation out of their A I road map where I would contrast that with hubspot, which is another name that we really like that has been showing a lot of innovation on the CRM front.So I think salesforce has its work cut out on the A I front.All right, Fred, quickly want to get your take.Yeah, I think I'm, I'm quite aligned here actually with how Rishi is approaching this.I think in the big picture of the software space, uh Microsoft, of course, we talked about fantastic.I think service now stands out to me as one of the top uh generative A I picks in our portfolio sales force.I really like, I do think that you have an opportunity here to just thoroughly imbue generative A I and A I throughout the entire sales force stack, makes sellers.",

city headquarters we are giving you the ultimate investing playbook to help tune out the noise and make the right moves for your money here your headline blitz getting you up to speed one hour for the closing bell rings on wall street ms  earnings are very important because in general  if you look at what has been critical to s and p s rise  it s been big tech and mbd is a critical component probably the most important component of that subgroup of just six stocks nvidia is growing and evolving could it have a short term impact on the market here no question do we own it we own it are we staying in it yes  nvidia is one of those names i think if you hold it over the next decade  you re going to be very well rewarded while some of the headline numbers were light of what was expected targets clearly making progress story continuesits same store sales was down less this quarter than it was last quarter uh plus it showed progress on its gross margin we ve got one hour to go until the market close and we re taking a look at the major averages although today  i m actually going to start with the video we got to get to the major averages in just a moment but happy nvidia earnings day to those who observe  we have the shares pulling back from the record high where they closed yesterday we re going to dig much more into nvidia  but as we ve talked a lot about and we re going to talk more about  the stakes are high with the shares of 90  year to date so let s get to the major averages here because there s a lot to talk about when it comes to them as well we are seeing the dow go to the lows of the session here off right now  about 6 10 of 1  the s and p 500 off now about a half 1  as is the nasdaq  what s going on it looks like it is the federal reserve minutes which were  were  were released just about an hour ago that seems to be to blame here in those minutes which were from the meeting that concluded on may 1st participants expressed willingness to potentially tighten policy further if we continue to see inflation readings that are not showing much relief and on top of that  we had goldman sachs is david solomon speaking in comments at boston college and saying he expects zero rate cuts this year and he says the risk of real and palpable economic slowdown is now big than it was six months ago now  stocks perhaps not down more because those federal reserve minutes in that discussion occurred before we got the latest cp i report which showed a little bit of relief on the inflation front so all of that said we are seeing that pull back i want to get to sectors here real quick within the s and p 500 energy down the most right now  consumer discretionary materials  utilities pretty broad based  sell up in fact  the only group that is hired right now is health care  josh julie  let s get right to it invidia earnings are just over an hour away the report where wall street has been waiting for  of course  our own dan halley is here with what to expect  dan yeah  i think obviously the  the big news here is it s gonna be the  obviously the  the top line and bottom line numbers  but then the  the guidance going forward and i think  you know  after seeing the massive jumps that we had seen in the prior quarters  uh the  the big news is going to be how did they do this quarter but then what s happening next quarter and what does that mean as far as wall street s interpretation right  because we re gonna start to  to lap last year where everything started to really blow up and we saw these  you know  100  200  gains right i think the last quarter  uh  the revenue is around 21 6 billion something  uh  in  in that area  uh  nearly for that one quarter  nearly the entire revenue of the year prior in one quarter so we re gonna have to what  what that means for this quarter and then moving forward those comps  what that looks like and how wall street responds to that are you gonna say well  look  you re not doing 300  growth i don t know what to tell you you know  we re out or are they gonna say ok  you re still the odds on leader in a i and frankly  they are still with  with the hardware that they have to offer as well as the  the software mode that they have now something you and i have been talking a little bit about is what these chips are being used for within a i and there s sort of two phases of a i that are important there is the training and this is something i think we talked about a little bit yesterday  the training where you re building these large language models in the generative a i  right where they re learning  then once you get them trained  then you have inference where they actually start working  they start making connections i m saying it like it s a brain but we  we uh you know  who was it who said this week  we don t wanna anthropomorphize them too much was it  sata adella  who said that in any case where they start making forecasts and making uh thinking for lack of a better word  right so the thing is to sort of figure out where nvidia fits in  it fits into the training  we know that and then what happens yeah  i mean  look the the the training is  is really the the heavy duty processing that  that these companies need these chips for if you re gonna be training  you re  you  you need that kind of hardcore performance infer  you still need that performance but not as much the the the the the data heavy side of training requires these big chips but you can use less powerful  more efficient chips for infer incing itself that s not to say that you can just like pop out a laptop chip from like  you know  my macbook and start infer that s crazy  but it  it doesn t need to be these kinds of heavy duty invidia chips and so i think the  the  as we start to see companies go from training to infer  what does that then mean for nvidia overall does that mean that companies will start opting for less powerful and more efficient chips so that they re not consuming as much and as much energy and not paying as much when they uh sign on with cloud providers that s a question that that is really important for nvidia to answer let me see  we were talking to dan niles on the show  you know  smart guy  long time tech investor and  and nvidia fan and we asked dan  you know that when you re talking to your clients and they wanna ask you about downside risk  what do you tell them he  he named a few different points but then he said something that  you know  he said one risk he talks to his clients about is how  you know  yes  it s a chip giant but the real secret sauce is the software that s what s locking the customers into the silicone and his point being  of course  there s the efforts to develop these  you know  open source alternatives and ii  i don t dan  i did not see that as a near even intermediate term risk  but how do you see it i think that that is something that a lot of companies are keeping in mind and so i think it s  it s important to  you can look at it almost from how the cloud evolved over time  right when the cloud computing really started taking off initially  it was  well  let s sign up for a cloud provider  right and then you saw a company say  i don t wanna get locked in with one guy that s just not good for me  that s not good for competition uh my clients might want something else uh customers might  might not wanna pay for this particular client or maybe i don t wanna have all my data relying uh sitting in this one place maybe i wanna have  you know  uh it on uh another provider so now you have what s called a multi cloud strategy  right it just makes more sense to  to disperse your  your data across different areas and so i think you can kind of look at it in that same way where you initially go ok  we have these nvidia chips they re great you re seeing the  the hyper scalar  the microsoft  the googles  the amazons  uh they spread out  right they have their own chips now that they re  they re building their own training and infer chips uh they have nvidia  they have a md uh i m sure they re using intel as well at  at some point but i  i think that the  the effort is going to be this  this more open source idea and yeah  c a is uh the  the  the software mode  right once you build on cu a  you re building the software for that particular architecture and so now there s ideas of  well  how can other companies maybe open that up so that you don t have to just rely on c a  you can get beyond that chips that can work with c a even um just quickly  a little perspective  a pause for some perspective here  we have two pie charts because we were looking a few years back 2021 at what the revenue breakdown looked like for nvidia at that time and by the way  uh nvidia was the yahoo finance committee of the year back in 20 16 but this revenue under  17 billion and gaming was still 46 5  of the revenue  40  was data center fast forward to 2024 the or  and fiscal 2025 for the company but um or fiscal actual 2023 fiscal 2024 excuse me  revenue   61 billion 70 8  of that data center and it s not that  that the gaming side is  is losing i mean  maybe during that period  the  the 2021 where we saw the spike with  with uh covid people going out and purchasing cards and then we also saw the uh the crypto kind of surge was  was going hard at that point  people buying those up uh and then on the secondary market  they were selling for like  you know   1500 when i mean  i m a gamer  i couldn t get that man um but yeah  and then you  you  you look at how it s kind of changed to now where the gaming side is  it s cooled off a little bit people still are buying those chips though it s still the  the i mean  look  if you look at a breakdown between nvidia a md and other uh when it comes to dedicated chips  nvidia crushes everything  right so it s not as though gaming isn t an important business for them it s just that the data center has exploded it s not that the others aren t growing it s that  that is growing so much more dan  we re gonna check in with you again thanks so much appreciate it although expectations for nvidia s first quarter results are high once again  topping those estimates has not necessarily translated into big stock moves in recent quarters  josh schafer is here with more on that as the bogey s gotten a little bit tougher  right i  i m  i m totally mixing my sports metaphors there  but it s gotten harder to beat  uh  whatever  whatever that  that s a metaphor  we know a forever  right but for nvidia  really  the last couple quarters  we ve seen that beating and raising as they have been doing hasn t always necessarily meant that the stock pops like most stocks pop in that scenario so what you re looking at here is the implied options or the implied move for the stock after earnings uh  according to options  this is from the friday going into earnings that s in purple the blue is the actual earnings reaction so today  we re looking at perhaps an 8 5  move closer to 9  move now per options but when you look at these blue and purple lines  you see  they don t actually line up that much so  really the broad takeaway here is what the expectations were going into the report don t quite matter that much once we get to about 415 this afternoon and it hasn t really been that accurate in other words  we have no idea we have no idea and then the other takeaway from this graph is that in q two and q three of last year nvidia did beat and raise and the stock didn t even go up right and that is something that could very well be a reality tonight into tomorrow right the stock is at an all time high right now  or just off an all time high and up  over 90  going into the print it s always something i think just important as investors to keep in mind when you re kind of staring at your screen later tonight  or maybe tomorrow morning and you read the commentary and it all  it all could seem relatively positive  but the stock isn t in the green well  maybe there was just a massive rally reading into the reading into the print and it s just not enough to move a stock that has rallied over 200  over the last year it s something we ve seen on earnings over the last couple of quarters we re gonna find out what about the broader market  josh yeah  it s gonna be interesting to see what happens with nvidia in terms of the broader market  right so we know obviously it is a large portion of the s and p 500 at this point  the nasdaq 100 many of the major indexes and it is able to move those indexes quite significantly so we were looking at your screen here is just simply the weighting of the company in the s and p 500 it s about 5  of the s and p 500 6 percent of the nasdaq 100 so on and so forth there so essentially  if you see a big move in this stock tomorrow  it might also mean that you re why you re seeing a move in the major indexes and that s not even really getting into the fact that we know if nvidia says something about a i demand  that means x or y for chips as well  right so if they re saying positive and now for utilities  maybe for hyper scalars like there  it could be very broad and i think that s the main thing i m interested to see tomorrow as you just mentioned  julie is sort of the utilities  energy trade and that real a i broadening that we ve had does that now trade on nvidia earnings too i don t know  but it certainly could to some extent  right and it s gonna be interesting to me  something to watch in the market action tomorrow find out it ll be fun it will be fun thanks josh and be sure to tune into young finance tonight and tomorrow  dan halley and i will be speaking with nvidia  ceo jensen huang after the earnings call so you don t want to miss his comments  stocks near the lows of the day as investors wait for the results of nvidia s first quarter earnings it s coming up after the bell  expectations we know are high for the tech giant and the stocks move this year accounts for a quarter of the s and p five hundred s gain according to deutsche bank joining us now is will mcgough director of investment at prime capital investment advisors will good  see you thanks for having us so let s let s maybe start there will nvidia after the bell today what are you expecting what does it mean for the market i just wanna know who s not talking about nvidia i ve been in new york  new york for a couple of days and all of our meetings a i is the buzzword so it s uh all eyes are on nvidia today as you just showed josh  it s gonna drive the market with 5  weight in the s and p i don t specifically run our stock portfolios i m a multi asset guy  but our p ms are looking at operating earnings they re trying to see if competition is gonna drip in a little bit  take away a little bit of market share and so that s what our guys are looking at of course  we own nvidia like everybody else and we ll be observing just like everybody else well  and how are you thinking about it or are you thinking about it from a macro perspective right not just invidia specifically  but the whole a i play  it s as  as you just mentioned with utilities  it s coming down utilities is like a two or 3  waiting sector of the s and p a lot of folks think it s old economy getting bid up with utilities  but it s really a tech driven uh buzz move here so i think it s uh got huge implications across the economy it s uh could command multiples higher uh you know  for example  last year it was no earnings growth it was all multiple expansion earnings seasons coming through this year with multiple saying about the same so could we enter a period where multiples could be rationally viewed higher when everybody else thinks they should come back towards average because of a i i think that s something that investors need to think about well  do you  when you think about nvidia  do you think about it now and do your p ms think about it as kind of a gauge  a broader barometer rather than just  you know  does it say something more than just about nvidia itself at this point for sure  you have to think about trends and a i is a trend is driving speculation what could be market breath with small cap sos getting built up it could be a i with large cap growth max seven uh the us economy of stock market is like a super tanker it takes a while for these trends to percolate they go on for a while and it takes a while for a new trend to develop so you have to be aware of these trends in the market to ultimately position your portfolios speaking of trends  what is the inflation trend that is the other big question right now that s gotten overshadowed by nvidia we got a little bit of a hint of it in the fed minutes where participants said  well  maybe we are gonna need to tighten more the market seems to be sort of shrugging that i mean  how did you read those comments they were a little dated i mean  i  i casually checked in on it before i was coming here to prep and it was more hawkish than i expected as you would most investors in its markets down a little bit today because of it uh the fed likes to float speakers that have different theories out there to see how the market may react to cuts or no cuts and we re kind of in a camp where we may see the unexpected of a hike if this rate  you know  inflation  jay powell told you  he  he basically took that off the table we could see it i mean  that s what s gonna happen if inflation stick here and rates stay higher  which i think is a good thing ultimately  if you have a higher rate environment  we haven t seen it and gosh knows how long uh so we can kind of get back to the old regime from like the sixties and seventies where you ve got competition for capital with debt investors and equity investors it is healthy we deal with a lot of retirement investors so having cash rates higher is a good thing uh capital market assumptions increase higher when rates are when risk free is higher too so i think higher rates are good we re just uh conditioned to a bias of a low rate environment that s changing and a lot of folks have grown up in this industry with low rates and that s all they yeah so we have to see how that s going to affect  you know  cyclical and secular trends going forward too but that said  i think  you know  mcdonald s has come out with the value meal target s gonna reduce prices on 3000 items or something like that so we could be at peak inflation uh peak rate move um and we could just be talking about all this could just be a whole bunch of nothing you know  the old adage sell in may and go away i think it s a good strategy this year it s uh we got all this news baked in markets should just settle down over the summer enjoy your summer break because when we come back in the fall  we got an election so all that volatility i m taking off for the summer well  thank you appreciate the  the green light on that thanks so much for being here appreciate it we re just getting started here on market domination coming up shares of target are seeking today after it missed on earnings we ll check in on the retail giant and a few other trending tickers on the other side and at 430 eastern time  it s the latest edition of our new show asking for trend we dive into the latest numbers from nvidia and breaking down the moves that will be affecting your money and be sure to tune into yahoo finance tonight and tomorrow  dan halley and i will be speaking with nvidia  ceo jensen wong after the earnings call stay tuned we ve got more market coverage after this let s get to some trending tickers first up  target shares of the retail giant are sinking after a target missed on earnings it also issued a forecast for the current quarter well below expectations  target shares have lost nearly half of their value since touching an all time high back in november of 2021 they are up this year um before today  they were up by about 9  although obviously they have cut that  but the stock is down the most in november 2022 today after they reported comps fell 3 7  that is uh comparable store sales um which was the fourth straight quarter of decline yeah so the stock taking a big hit what are bulls saying today julie well  d a davidson s mike baker got a buy ring here s what he told his clients bottom line is that the best print he said  you know  you gotta acknowledge that but largely is basically in line thinking  this is not uh justifying the kind of sell off we re seeing for stock trading at a below average multiple in other words  he thinks it s attractively valued here with comps poised to turn positive he said margins are still improving we think this makes for a buying opportunity he reiterated his buy rating that s interesting i mean  even uh simeon gutman over at morgan stanley who also is an over has an overweight rating he was used about the increase in sgn a sales general administrative costs at the company and that was a head scratcher for some of the other analysts as well and then on top of that  you have traffic and average transaction falling 1 9  last quarter  which was really something that uh analysts said was concerning  you know  they saw a drop in home goods and furniture and apparel and food so  you know  there s  it s the this current quarter could see an uptick  but we ll have to see if that guy i spoke to mike baker over d a davidson he kind of made the comparison he said  you know  he buys on both likes walmart  but he s like  listen  they are best in breed firing in all cylinders target turnaround story you know  you re the believer you don t finally our next trending ticker let s check out lulu lemon here shares falling as much as 7  they found the news that its chief product officer to cho is leaving so that was  that was the news  you know  chief product officer leaves it does not sound uh really like she s getting replaced apparently the responsibilities it sounds like it said  gonna kinda getting shifted to other colleagues and i did see some analysts who cover the company quote as saying this news just kind of added to these broader worries they had this means for the sales weakness in other words  people reading into it  you know what i m worried about the belt bag are you familiar with the belt bag ok it s a fan is what we used to call fanny pack and then it got like a 20 twenties makeover and now it s called a belt bag and you don t always wear it around your waist sometimes you wear it around ok i have two lulu and belt bags i read in one of these notes today or one of the commentaries  the belt bag might be going out really lemon s belt bag i like my belt bags i don t wanna get rid of my belt bags the fanny pack has made a big comeback i gotta tell you there s all i really  yeah  it s a whole thing i might have to switch to my daddy dover i have too many of these things clearly  but my point there is a bigger point here it s not just about my own personal what i m carrying around my stuff in  but that  that is little lemon losing some of that cachet is kind of the bigger question here remember we talked to adrian yee  um who talked of barclays  who talked about that the wide leg denim trend was hurting lulu i remember that uh conversation with her and she said that this was sort of an incrementally negative data point that this uh executive was leaving they do report uh q one result coming up  june 5th so hoping to get a little more insight and guidance that time and analysts are looking for the smallest same store sales growth that we ve seen in quite some time for the company finally  we re taking a look at some buy now  pay later stocks  a firm paypal block  they re all lower today  after the consumer financial protection bureau proposed a new rule that would force the lenders to adhere to the same consumer protections as credit cards so it was sort of an interpretation of existing rules and laws that would create more parallels between credit card companies and some of these companies in other words  you know  that they would have to  i don t know  adhere to some more stringent standards  although a credit card company has to assess a borrower s ability to repay they re not suggesting that the b npl companies will have to do that it s interesting it s not surprising maybe juliette  you see regulators at least kicking the tires more and more because b npl has grown so i mean  just it just as an industry so this big jump and usage as e commerce just exploded during the pandemic and now others have jumped in i mean  how many big banks even offering these  you know  pay overtime products so maybe not too surprised to see  you know  washington at least taking harder looks and in firm for its part said uh in an email to yahoo finance that they ve already disclosed that the cfp b already oversees some parts of their business and they re gonna continue to work with them so we ll see how it ends up affecting them well  new data on existing home sales for april out today  that number declining for the second straight month to an annual rate of 4 14 million yet the median price of an existing home sold rose by 5 7  year over year  just over  400 000 joining us now  realtor com  chief economist dan yell hale danielle  it s good to see you so as we look at these numbers and this continued weakness  can we mostly point the finger at  at mortgage rates which have not come down yeah  i think mortgage rates and the resulting lack of affordability in the housing market is a key culprit behind this disappointing print today  i should say somewhat disappointing print so 3 14 million  i m sorry  4 14 million a modest decline from last month home sales have been at this relatively low 4 million plus level for the past several months they re really kind of struggling to out of here because there are some significant challenges in the housing market  not just higher mortgage rates  but also home prices that hit a new high for this time of year and continue to present affordability challenges in order to really make some headway against these challenges  we re going to need to see more building the housing market continues to be short on supply even though we did see some optimistic numbers  some signs of improving supply we re still not at a point where supply is ample enough uh  to help cool off home price growth danielle  let s stick with mortgage rates for a second because i  i m on mortgage news daily here they re telling me the 30 year fixed danielle 7 09  i m interested where you think that is  you know  six months from now  danielle  12 months from now and what s  you know  what s the rate that we need to see to really jump start greater activity  danielle  you know  do you  do you think it s 6 5  6 lower well  when you look at outstanding mortgage debt  90  of it right now is under 6  and about two thirds of it is under 4  so for existing homeowners who are  you know  maybe reasonably happy with their home but ready to make a trade either up or down or to something different uh it is really expensive to try to get a mortgage at a 7  rate compared to their current rate 90  some of them are under six and two thirds are under 4  so it makes it a lot more expensive to move the closer we get back to uh to those numbers  i think the more we re going to see housing activity ramp up and every drop in mortgage rates brings some potential buyers and likely sellers as well back to the housing market so every little step down is going to help but you know  i think we re not going to get to levels where we re going to see a jumpstart in housing activity i think it s going to be more of a of uh a trickle or a slow comeback in housing activity as those mortgage rates come down danielle  i m really curious about the new home market versus the existing home market  right the existing home market much bigger to be sure  but we are not seeing the same kind of pricing pressure in the new home market you know  we re seeing incentives still be offered because the home builders wanna move those homes so if people are looking right now is new  are new homes actually more affordable on a relative basis  they re not necessarily more affordable on a  you know  an absolute price basis but i think new homes are definitely an area that consumers should explore  especially if they re in a region like the south where builders have been really active parts of the southwest builders remain active and so  you know  builders don t have a low existing mortgage rate that they are tied into and so they have continued to build and create inventory is available for buyers they also are  you know  they re a business and so they re very pragmatic when looking at the market  if they need to make incentives in order to make a home purchase affordable for buyers  they have shown a willingness to do so whether that s cutting asking prices or offering mortgage rate  buy downs either temporary or longer term and so as a result  if consumers are shopping and they see  you know  if they haven t considered new homes  it does make sense to consider them new homes right now because uh builders have done a good job of keeping up their pace of activity represent about 30  of the market of homes for sale so it is likely that consumers are going to have new homes as an option to consider and perhaps more so than they can find in the existing home market today all right  danielle always appreciate having you on the show thanks so much for joining us absolutely coming up  we re playing ball in the latest edition of our series goodbye or goodbye find out which sports media stock to be a home run for your portfolio stay tuned  more market domination after this  please it s a big noisy universe of stocks out there welcome to goodbye or goodbye our goal to help cut through that noise to navigate the best moves for your portfolio today  we re taking a look at sports media stocks in a match up between one intellectual property owner and a distributor what s the best way to play it right now i m here with chris moran co cio at the be fun thanks so much for being here appreciate it so let s get your by stock and it is atlanta braves now  this is an interesting one you were interestingly enough  not the first person who has talked to us about this stock  but it is not one that s widely held or that is as much talked about within the sort of media space the shares are down over the past year  about 8 5  but if you look at it  you talk about the loyalty that people have right to something like the atlanta braves sure i know everybody wants to talk about a i today with  this is in many ways the anti a i play this is in person this is 100 and 50 year old company it s the oldest continuously operating sports franchise in north america the atlanta braves  there are very few opportunities to own sports assets in the public markets this is one of them and as you talk about owning sports in the public markets here  you we have seen in the private markets that there s been a lot of growth so this shows here on this chart  the nfl and where we ve seen that growth  the nba  the mlb  the nhl and the compound annual growth rate altogether 16  so in the private markets  we have seen that growth  sports assets have appreciated actually greater than the s and p over this time frame uh they ve been great stores of value for lots of reasons um that we ll talk about but uh there again  very few ways to participate yeah  there aren t very many ways to participate so what s interesting is that you say that the atlanta braves are  are treating any discount to that private market value  which is sort of counterintuitive well  so we  you know  first you start with what  what the private market value is first  we  we calculate the private market value of the team based on where other uh sports teams have transacted in the market over the last 10 or 20 years and we have a look at that actually  these are some of the recent cops uh in  in various leagues um the phillies are the most relevant um they sold a minority stake for seven times revenue we value the braves at something like 5 5 or six times revenue you add the value of the real estate which they have around the park and you get to a value of something like 3 5 billion for the company divided by the 62 million shares and uh you get to a stock price in the high fifties versus 40 today ok  got you so that is a  a considerable discount and it is illustrative to see  you know  the phillies valued it at  2 8 billion and then you have to ask with seeing those valuations kind of as the result of deals and knowing how much people are willing to pay for them it has to lead you to ask  could we see a deal with the braves right so there s been a persistent discount in other sports assets this is a little bit different because this asset is controlled by john malone and the folks at liberty media who split it off uh just about a year ago in july  uh in my view as a uh to position it for sale to a private who can capture that trophy value and close the discount to private market value would we potentially see a sale of part of it or do you think it s more likely you sell  you sell the entirety of the public company got you so we always talk about what a risk could be potentially and in this way  you say boredom is kind of a risk in other words  like if you no catalyst  you go kind of muddle along without a deal or something else happening i use boredom in particular because a lot of people find baseball boring it s not gotten more exciting with some of the rule changes but yeah  listen  there s not a lot of downside in my view to the private market value of this franchise it s not like it s gonna get technologically disintermediated or they re gonna fall on their face in terms of earnings really it s just a matter of the discount persisting for a very long period of time because there s not a transaction to surface the value do you happen to be a braves fan also  i am not a braves fan i am a new york yankees fan i was gonna say your accent implies you would be more a northern uh fan than an atlanta braves fan and you guys do own atlanta braves and your portfolios our clients are actually the larger shareholders of this company ok there you go so let s talk about the stock you don t like this one is interesting it s disney now these years are up over the past year there s been a lot going on with disney obviously  the first reason you say you call it analog dollars for digital dimes what do you mean by that so first of all  let me preface this by saying before i get all the dis nerds out there uh mad at me  disney has fantastic intellectual property and is run by a very great leader in bob tiger  but it s still not immune to the forces impacting the media industry and and i started as a media analyst 20 years ago and i m very familiar with those and  and that s basically this um concept that media companies were over earning for decades in the old big pay tv bundle system that has come apart with streaming and uh it means that the companies are gonna earn less going forward and disney s done a pretty good job of  of transitioning their business to direct to consumer  but it s never gonna be as good it once was and still has some challenges in the immediate term and you also  when you also say analog dollars for digital dimes is that  you know  they do have an analog business also in the form of the parks  but they re also investing all this money and trying to make streaming sort of work yeah and this and the parks business is more than half of the ida  more than half of the cash flow of this company and  and more than half of the value too but we still like that business on a secular basis the experiential economy is one we ve uh been a proponent of it actually um it works for the braves as well  but that one actually has some cyclical challenges coming up yeah and let s talk about that  the economic sensitivity and those  those parks are not getting any less expensive  that is for sure for those of us with children who ve been there recently and uh you know  both both comcast which owns the universal parks and disney have called out a moderating demand this summer in their  in their parks just as we get through covid normalization and  and frankly  as the consumer is a little bit strained and can t spend as much and then we showed that stock chart at the beginning where the stock is appreciated  something like 18 5  over the past year and as i said  there s a lot that s been going on  namely a big proxy fight  right that has helped in part drive the shares up what now yeah  exactly that s sort of the issue is that  you know  a lot of the catalysts are in the rearview mirror  whether it s the  the try and proxy battle that  that you referenced  uh taking costs out  um getting the dtc business  the direct to consumer business to profit  neutral  profitability  which they ve all done and check  check those boxes and that s why the stock has done well from here it s gonna be more difficult trading out of  call it a 20 times kind of uh multiple slight premium to the market uh and there s just not a lot of enough of margin of safety for us to continue owning it ok so let s talk about what then could go  right that would maybe change your view  you know  if they do have good assets  they do still have bob iger in there we don t know what s happening after bob iger  but you know  he could turn the ship from here it s largely an execution story and if they over execute  if they take more costs out  if they get direct to consumer uh right  faster than we think they will  the other side is gonna continue to dwell the other thing i d mention is this is an industry that s undergoing consolidation you ve got paramount subject of a takeover battle warner brothers discovery could be another one i don t think it s likely that anybody buys disney  but there have been whispers of apple for example  being interested again i don t think that s likely but it s  it s not a nonzero chance and that is a risk to the upside now  you said you wouldn t want to own disney or do you guys have some disney you ve owned disney in the past we ve been saying goodbye to it interesting ok but you still have a little bit but you re  you re working it and we re very tech sensitive so we have clients with very low basis understood chris  thank you so much let s let s summarize what you re telling folks here you say you would buy atlanta braves holdings based on a significant discount to sport teams  private market value on the other side  you think avoid disney amid the decline of traditional media and lack of catalyst going forward chris mirani  good to see you thanks for coming in and thank you so much for watching goodbye or goodbye we ll be bringing you new episodes three times a week at 330 pm eastern time for some calls of the day  goldman sachs upgrading shopify today to buy it from neutral and raising its price target to  74 up from 67 so  you know  this stock is interesting it s been under some pressure it s down more than 20  so far this year goldman says though  ok  that is an opportunity because they say yes  there s an investment cycle weighing on margins  more mixed consumer spending we know that s been weighing on the stock but they tell their clients  you stick with this because shopify has significant technology mode in e commerce  software share gain across e commerce cycles they point out bottom line that s gonna drive goldman says durable growth at scale goldman does point out some risk but bottom line  they say this one is a buy to their clients yeah  and the stock is down like 25  year to date so they re looking at it and seeing all of that that is perhaps priced in and not justified given that um and they talk about the  the company has been in investing in what they call large adjacency in other words  you know  sort of bolt on technology  things that are adjacent to their business that will be a creative over time and that s also one of the reasons uh that they like the stock yeah  there are some downside risks they point out  listen  they say consumer spending could be worse that would  that would pressure gmv shares in ecommerce could be a impact they said by kind of aggressive investment from companies rivals that s amazon temu  but that is not their base case here that they re buyers um and then we got him and hers to talk about also hims and hers being downgraded over at citigroup to neutral from buy but the analysts are also raising their price circuit from  16 to  20 the stock is down 7  i have to say this is one of the more effusive downgrades that i have seen here because the analysts  they re still like him and hers over the long term  they talk about the  the recent announcement that the company is going to be selling g lp ones through their site and they say assuming an average monthly average selling price of  230 a month  this equates to an almost comically large  30 billion revenue opportunity i love that  but the stock has rallied a lot so that s basically why they re saying they would take a policy that s it after the announcement they say listen  the stock jumped 20  added about 760 of enterprise value  leaves little room for upside in their opinion they say given the significant uncertainties around the economics and durability of g lp ones  we are moving to the sidelines indeed and so are other investors today to some extent well  coming up  we ll bring you down the best ways to position in your software  your portfolio in the software space after some key announcements in the sector in recent weeks  stay tuned for the yahoo finance playbook on the other side  microsoft is going all in on a i the company this week announced a new category of p cs called copilot plus their computers equipped with so called a i pc chips and will now run on open a is gp t  40 model so as software technology continues to advance  we re looking at how to navigate the big picture and the best ways to position your portfolio with the yahoo finance playbook let s welcome in rishi  juria r bc capital market  software equity analyst  as well as frederick havemeyer  the head of usa i and software research at macquarie gentlemen  thank you so much for being here i guess let s start  first of all with the microsoft announcement itself and sort of how we should think about it as investors  how big of a deal it will be  how incrementally um it will add to revenue  etcetera r  i ll start with you yeah  absolutely and thanks so much for having us we were just out in seattle at microsoft build this week and look  i think the introduction of these a ip cs is actually going to be a really big game changer to getting generative a i in the hands of every knowledge worker out there right recall when you use any sort of gp t system today  it requires a fast internet connection  a lot of computing power now  you know  it s going  it s going to take time to  you know  they get light enough that  that everyone can use them  but you ll be able to use some of these more small language and medium language models locally without a super fast internet connection and so that i think will enable a lot more kind of general purpose uh a i use cases and workloads that previously didn t exist so i do think this is a very exciting announcement for microsoft  fred let s bring you in here as well same question  fred so you know your reaction to that microsoft event  you know rishi says these new a ip cs game changer  fred  do you agree so for the past year  we ve been making the call consistently that a i is going to have to move to the edge  it s gonna have to move to the device and in many cases  this does require hardware like what microsoft is rolling out to do it and it s what would get us excited both about making this successful to consumers and knowledge workers plus also being able to drive uptake of a i in a profitable way because if you recall  i think one of the last time i was on yahoo finance  we had a great time talking about what smaller language models mean large language models still quite large but nevertheless smaller mean to uh margins and as we found we explored in the past  we think that achieving uh 80  to 90  plus gross margins with running generative a i models can be done by using small language models on specialized hardware or on local devices so i think quite exciting  fred  just follow up on that  you wrote a recent note about how consumers are gonna determine the impact here and i keep trying to figure out if where we are in the a i cycle is still um push or it s starting to be pull in other words  like all this stuff is coming out are customers particularly on the retail side asking for this or these companies still at the face where they have to convince them that they want it i think that when we look at products out there like chat g bt  i think we already see that there are north of 100 million users that i would qualify in many cases as consumers really interested in these types of products now commercializing it and making it something that s useful and interesting for consumers i do think that there are technologies out there that have been perhaps what you describe as a solution in search of a problem and at the same time  i do think that it s very clear to us that the technology of generative a i model of large language models is something that we find fit with consumers over time chat gp t did and i think that with the right interface and the right uh platform  we ll find it over time i mean  i m a user of meta s rayban glasses  not here to discuss meta but just the glasses they re fascinating they re really good and i really enjoy having this like modality of working with  with these a i models sitting right in my glasses so we ll see over time  rishi same question i mean  when you look across uh your your coverage universe richie  what  what kind of customer adoption and engagement are you seeing when it comes to  you know  these new a i products and features yeah um a absolutely and i m glad you have me alongside fred because i  i definitely agree with him on a lot of what he s saying uh look the  the what what i would say is when we re talking to companies  we re talking to cio s cto s heads of it there is real appetite for a i usage within the enterprise um a lot of this  i would say maybe 70  of it is actually net new budget so it s not even cannibalizing other parts of it it s coming out from other parts of the organization um so there s real money being earmarked uh we re  we re  we re seeing uh i d say 80  of cio s are telling us that they are either currently in production or expect to be in production with a i over the next 12 months so the appetite is real  the use cases are real and remember we re still at very  very early stages of this if i draw the analogy to the internet stages  you know  even though gp t four  incredibly powerful  this is probably 14 4 dial up level  right we haven t even reached the high speed broadband so i think there s still a lot more way for the technology to advance from here  but already seeing real interest from the enterprise and from consumers as well so we know you guys both like microsoft  even before this latest event  you guys both have outperform ratings on that one fred with you  i wanna dig into a couple others because you like a couple of the cyber security names including crowd strike and we recently heard from palo alto that seemed to make uh investors a little uncomfortable here do you think uh the likes of a crowd strike are gonna benefit from a i as to how it relates to cyber security or is it just a more general cybersecurity play so we do think that it relates like crowd is really benefiting i think from generative a i as a trend while they re not selling generative a i themselves  we think that the advent of generative a i is making it much easier for attackers to exploit a lot of things like for example  fishing attacks are becoming far more sophisticated uh attackers that want to build software are getting also just power ups now being able to use generative a i perhaps to actually build malware more effectively we think that crowdstrike which protects the endpoint  it protects the device as the last line of defense against all those attacks that have penetrated every other of security is really well positioned to defend against the brand new unknown threats that we think are likely to emerge with the advent of generative a i so really like crowdstrike is our top pick for just overall trend based exposure to generative a i in the cybersecurity sector rishi 11 name i m interested in so you got apple forms on microsoft crm so  fanella and benioff  you also richie like zoom uh which has been a tough slog  you know  in the red richie year to date over the past 12 months why is zoom a buy here yeah  i think zoom has a really interesting play when it comes to a i there is so much unstructured data when you think about video and audio even  you know  non verbal communication that i think zoom has a really interesting road map i think the hiring of actually from uh microsoft was  was a great one and i really like that kind of thought leadership m uh sorry zoom has put out on having a federated a i approach um you think about things like sales coaching that uh it can tell sales people look  you re not making eye contact  stop wandering and make eye contact with your prospective customer uh hr when you re doing interviews with people  hey  this body language suggests that uh um the  you know  prospective employee might be wrong or  or lying  maybe problem with one or two follow up question um and i think about those use cases  maybe even vertical them for the contact center where contact center zoom has been getting a great amount of success i think zoom is very much an underappreciated a i play in my book and i love that it will help you be more human or interact better with other humans that s a sort of a fascinating offshoot of all of this you got 11 other one  you guys both like is sales force and michelle take you quickly on this and then we ll get fred s opinion on on why you think it is gonna benefit here i mean  that stock has also had some exogenous things going on  activist pressure  et cetera yeah um i i will say my uh bullishness on sales force is more related to the self help element of the story i think there s a lot of margin expansion from here um there s a lot more cost cutting  they can do a lot more efficiencies they can bring to the organization so the stock feels very much undervalued in my book and i think there s upside to numbers and upside to the multiple from an a i perspective i  i will say maybe i m a little counter consensus on this i want to see more out of sales force when it comes to a i  in theory  they could be a huge beneficiary they re a system of record uh sales  people  marketing  people all rely on a day in day out and it s a huge platform with this massive ecosystem  but i just haven t seen enough innovation out of their a i road map where i would contrast that with hubspot  which is another name that we really like that has been showing a lot of innovation on the crm front so i think salesforce has its work cut out on the a i front all right  fred  quickly want to get your take yeah  i think i m  i m quite aligned here actually with how rishi is approaching this i think in the big picture of the software space  uh microsoft  of course  we talked about fantastic i think service now stands out to me as one of the top uh generative a i picks in our portfolio sales force i really like  i do think that you have an opportunity here to just thoroughly imbue generative a i and a i throughout the entire sales force stack  makes sellers ',

                        "Cathie Wood makes it easy to keep tabs on her aggressive growth stock habits. The co-founder, CEO, and investment manager of the Ark Invest family of exchange-traded funds publishes her transactions at the end of every trading day. She became a widely followed player with monster returns in 2020. She followed back-to-back years of disappointing returns with another market-thumping performance last year.Things haven't gone so well in 2024, but it's not stopping her from fine-tuning her collection of growth stocks day by day. Wood added to her existing positions in Shopify (NYSE: SHOP), Intellia Therapeutics (NASDAQ: NTLA), and Adaptive Biotechnologies (NASDAQ: ADPT) on Tuesday. Let's take a closer look at the stocks that are trading 16% to 29% lower in 2024.1. ShopifyThe online retailing giant is one of Wood's 10 largest holdings across her combined portfolios, playing a small part in her market-trouncing performance last year as well as this year's slide. Shares of the e-commerce platform that gives sellers of all sizes a way to get their digital storefronts noticed more than doubled last year. The stock is down 27% in 2024, and a poorly received financial update earlier this month didn't help.Revenue rose 23% in the first quarter, or a heartier 29% increase if you back out the logistics business that it unloaded over the past year. This isn't the reason for the stock plummeting 19% the day it announced results. Top-line results exceeded market expectations. It was also a beat on the bottom line. The problem came in its guidance. Shopify warned that growth for the current quarter will decelerate to the high teens, or the low-to-mid-twenties when adjusted for the lack of its logistics business. Wall Street was holding out for more. At least 14 analysts would go on to lower their price targets on the stock following the May 8 report.Image source: Getty Images.Shopify was a rock star for investors, cranking out revenue growth of 47% or better for nearly a decade through the end of 2021. This is shaping up to be the third consecutive year of sub-30% gains on the top line.There is still a strong business here if you dig deeper. It has delivered three straight quarters of double-digit free-cash-flow margin, and that streak is expected to stretch to four in the current quarter. Revenue growth may be slowing, but Shopify continues to gain market share. Analysts see revenue climbing 21% this year and another 20% come 2025. It may translate into four years of failing to top 30% growth, but an optimist would see it as four years of clearing 20%. Earnings gains should be even stronger.Story continuesWood sees an opportunity in the post-earnings sell-off that has continued to eat away at the stock in the last two weeks. She may not be alone. Goldman Sachs upgraded the stock on Wednesday, feeling that the downticks are overdone.2. Intellia TherapeuticsIntellia is another major holding across the Ark portfolios. There are only a dozen stocks with a greater weighting. Wood has stakes in a few gene-editing stocks, figuring that owning a basket of its most promising players will pay off even if just one of them makes a major breakthrough.Like Shopify, Intellia didn't soar after beating expectations on both ends of the income statement two weeks ago. The good news is that it didn't move lower on the news, even though the shares are still down 16% year to date.This isn't a stock that's being judged by its quarterly numbers. The real story here is some potentially promising CRISPR-based therapies. Intellia has one treatment entering the critical third phase of clinical trials and will soon have a second. Because of its a cash-rich balance sheet, time is on its side. Wood's Ark owns a whopping 10.6% of Intellia's total share count.3. Adaptive BiotechnologiesWood added to only four of her existing positions on Tuesday, and three of them were gene-editing stocks. Adaptive Biotechnologies was one of them. She has a smaller position in the genetic sequencing technology specialist than the other additions, but she still owns more than 7% of Adaptive's shares outstanding.The stock is trading 29% lower in 2024, but this one moved higher after the company posted financial results two weeks ago. It boosted the midpoint of its full-year revenue guidance for its minimal residual disease (MRD) business, its largest segment. Losses also continue to narrow, but investors still aren't impressed. Its CFO leaving the company to pursue another opportunity isn't a good look, but Wood is still a believer.Should you invest $1,000 in Shopify right now?Before you buy stock in Shopify, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Shopify wasn’t one of them.

dig deeper  it has delivered three straight quarters of double digit free cash flow margin  and that streak is expected to stretch to four in the current quarter  revenue growth may be slowing  but shopify continues to gain market share  analysts see revenue climbing 21  this year and another 20  come 2025  it may translate into four years of failing to top 30  growth  but an optimist would see it as four years of clearing 20   earnings gains should be even stronger story continueswood sees an opportunity in the post earnings sell off that has continued to eat away at the stock in the last

                        'Shopify has accused a rival of creating a “thinly disguised knockoff” of the e-commerce platform’s software. In a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, Shopify claimed that Shopline—a subsidiary of Chinese technology company Joyy Inc.—copied its Dawn program.Dawn allows Shopify users to create a customizable online storefront through templates. According to the suit, Shopline copied Dawn with its own product, called Seed. Shopify said that Dawn’s file structure, layout, file names, function names, lines of code and icon codes can be found in Seed.More from Sourcing JournalConsumer Watchdog: Buy Now, Pay Later Apps Must Play by Same Rules as Credit CardsLevi Strauss Settles Trademark Lawsuit Against Brunello CucinelliShopify Stock Plummets After Lower Q2 Growth ExpectationsThe Canadian e-commerce platform also claimed the Shopify name still appears in the code of various versions of Seed, and that a Chinese webpage hosted by Joyy with the title “Seed Theme” still carries headers reading “dawn-test.”“By copying, modifying and distributing its Dawn knockoff in the United States, Shopline has engaged in widespread and willful infringement of Shopify’s copyrights in Dawn,” the lawsuit said. Shopify said that because of this, Shopline’s merchant clients are also guilty of infringement by association.Shopify requested a court order blocking Shopline’s infringement, as well as unspecified monetary damages.This isn’t Shopify’s first time contending with trademark issues. Last year, the e-commerce platform tangled with a patent troll—Dallas-based Lower48, which provides data analysis and portfolio management for the oil and gas industry—which claimed that Shopify’s features infringed on their own patented technologies.Shopify asked a judge to make Lower48 disclose all third-party interests in the suit, saying those entities may have a vested interest in the outcome of the case. Patent trolls try to exploit intellectual property for financial gain, often filing patents as a means to sue rivals.This latest lawsuit comes just days after Shopify reported a 23 percent increase in revenue for Q1 compared to last year. But the company’s outlook for the remainder of the year projected revenue growth at a high-teens percentage rate on a year-over-year basis. As a result, investors could be looking at Shopify’s lowest quarterly revenue growth in two years.Requests for comment from Shopify and Joyy were not immediately returned.',

                        "Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) is a fast-growing company with a rich valuation and small profit margins (for the moment). The stock has sold off over 20% following earnings, providing investors with an opportunity to buy at a discount.The earnings were overall good, but some investors may have been spooked with the lack of GAAP profitability.In this analysis, I explain why this is not a real concern, and three reasons I like the stock long term.Earnings recapWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with SHOP.Shopify exceeded both earnings and revenue estimates, yet the stock fell 20% following the announcement.Take Advantage of Shopify's DipRevenue grew by 23%, or 29% if we exclude the logistics arm that Shopify is closing down. The growth in revenue was particularly strong in merchant solutions, aligning closely with the guidance provided by the company last quarter. As it noted in the release:\"Revenue to grow at a low-twenties percentage rate on a year-over-year basis, which translates into a year-over-year growth rate in the mid-to-high-twenties when adjusting for the 500 to 600 basis points impact from the sale of our logistics businesses.\"Take Advantage of Shopify's DipGross margin, a key metric indicating Shopify's progress toward GAAP profitability, reached 49.80% in the last quarter of 2023. Management had projected a 150 basis point increase for the first quarter of this year.Investors were pleased to learn the company exceeded expectations with a reported gross margin of 51.40%, slightly surpassing the earlier guidance.Looking ahead, Shopify provided the following guidance:Revenue growth in the high 20sGross margin to decrease by 50 basis points due to slightly higher operating expensesFree cash flow margin expected to remain in line with the previous quarterBased on these positive figures and guidance, the stock's decline was unexpected.Why the sell-off?Although Shopify achieved higher revenue, margins and adjusted earnings per share, it still fell short of achieving actual GAAP profitability.Take Advantage of Shopify's DipShopify reported a loss of 21 cents per share this quarter, despite being profitable during the same period last year. This loss was primarily attributed to a $373 million loss on equity and other investments.The actual loss in earnings likely raised concerns among investors, especially considering it is a high-growth stock. This triggered a decline in the stock price, reflecting broader market trends affecting even mega-cap stocks.Three reasons to buyI have always been a fan of Shopify's underlying fundamentals. Despite some short-term headwinds, the growth story remains robust and I find the valuation reasonably attractive.Story continuesWhen it comes to growth, Shopify has a largely untapped market, especially internationally.Take Advantage of Shopify's DipFurther, its growth spans both online and offline channels.Take Advantage of Shopify's DipWhile growth prospects seem promising, the question remains about its margins.Overall, Shopify is benefitting from the growing move to e-commerce, which is not only taking place in the U.S. but accelerating overseas. The company has a dominant market position and is expanding value to its customers, which is ultimately going to translate in better growth.In addition, Shopify has historically faced challenges in achieving profitability, but they appear to be moving in the right direction.Take Advantage of Shopify's DipThe company's technical unprofitability is largely attributed to its strategic investments, which I am not particularly concerned about at the moment. Unless there is a significant economic downturn, I believe the coming months and years could be favorablefor the markets, with many of Shopify's initiatives poised to yield positive results.Shopify is ultimately a software platform, or at least it was before investing in logistics, which it is now divesting from. Therefore, I believe the company has the potential to achieve significant profitability in the coming years.Finally, Shopify's valuation metrics like the price-earnings or price-sales ratio may appear quite rich. However, when considering the forward PEG ratio (five-year expected), which compares the price-earnings ratio to the expected earnings growth rate, Shopify trades at 1.12 times its forward earnings growth rate.Take Advantage of Shopify's DipShopify has always traded at a high valuation, but this is justified given its fast growth and market dominance. This makes the stock volatile, as seen after earnings, but also gives investors more upside potential.Ultimately, Shopify's success will hinge on its ability to deliver on its earnings growth potential, a prospect that I am optimistic about.Technical outlookTake Advantage of Shopify's DipWe have now reached a critical volume support area, as indicated by the Visible Range Volume Profile. Looking at it from an Elliott Wave perspective, it appears we may have completed a 1-2 pattern within the larger (1)-(2), which could pave the way for a rally in wave 3 towards the $200 mark. Additionally, the relative strength index is rebounding from oversold levels and showing a bullish divergence with the price.While this projection might seem ambitious, keep in mind that Shopify previously traded as high as $175, and I anticipate surpassing those levels again.Shopify's stock is known for its volatility, with rapid downward movements being as common as upward ones.ConclusionIn summary, I believe this is a reasonable price point to acquire shares. The company holds strong long-term appeal and is making strides towards profitability, and the technical indicators suggest a favorable setup at this level.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

                        "Shopify, Kraft Heinz upgraded: Wall Street's top analyst callsThe most talked about and market moving research calls around Wall Street are now in one place. Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.Top 5 Upgrades: Goldman Sachs upgraded Shopify (SHOP) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $74, up from $67. Given Shopify's \"significant technology moat\" in e-commerce software and share gain across cycles, the firm believes these investments will drive more durable revenue growth at scale.Piper Sandler upgraded Kraft Heinz (KHC) to Overweight from Neutral with an unchanged price target of $42. The firm sees incrementally better visibility on Kraft Heinz's upside in foodservice, helped by its new innovation in time-saving dispensers, which it expects can drive incremental revenues within existing relationships and some incremental distribution.Needham upgraded Stryker (SYK) to Buy from Hold with a $392 price target. The firm expects new product launches combined with Stryker's capital equipment backlog to allow it to deliver upside to consensus revenue estimates and overcome any potential recon market slowdown.Citi upgraded Tandem Diabetes (TNDM) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $57, up from $40. The firm believes Tandem's guidance screens conservatively as it only relies on 70% patient renewals and flat to down new patient starts.Citi upgraded Edwards Lifesciences (EW) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $105, up from $98. The stock is positioned to work well into the end of the year, with a reset base business and optimism on the next leg of growth, the firm tells investors in a research note.Top 5 Downgrades:JPMorgan downgraded Middleby (MIDD) to Underweight from Neutral with a price target of $118, down from $145. The firm says the company's backlog tailwind is behind it.Citi downgraded Hims & Hers (HIMS) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $20, up from $16. With the stock up 20% since the GLP-1 launch announcement, Hims & Hers has effectively added $760M of enterprise value on limited new information, leaving little room for upside, the firm tells investors in a research note.Oppenheimer downgraded Generac (GNRC) to Perform from Outperform without a price target. The firm believes recent strength in the shares now reflects a more reasonable anticipation of business model development prospects.Morgan Stanley downgraded Box (BOX) to Equal Weight from Overweight with a price target of $32, down from $35. The firm cites a lack of near-term catalysts, prolonged macro challenges impacting Box's seat-based model, continued currency headwinds pressuring growth, and \"constant competitive overhang\" for the downgrade.Piper Sandler downgraded Digi International (DGII) to Neutral from Overweight with a price target of $29, down from $35, following a change in analysts. The company's business transition \"still has a long way to go before volatility can be significantly reduced\" while its internet of things share has been stagnant, the firm tells investors in a research note.Story continuesTop 5 Initiations: FBN Securities initiated coverage of JFrog (FROG) with an Outperform rating and $45 price target. The DevOps market is projected by the firm to grow by well over 20% year-over-year in both 2024 and 2025 and it believes that JFrog should be able to \"basically keep its market share against the prominent competitors.\" UBS also started coverage of JFrog with a Buy rating and $41 price target.UBS initiated coverage of Couchbase (BASE) with a Neutral rating and $31 price target. The firm likes Couchbase Capella's potential to accelerate new logo growth and support sustainable 20% annual recurring revenue growth over the coming years, but says Capella's growth to date still appears to be primarily driven by existing installed base conversions.UBS initiated coverage of DigitalOcean (DOCN) with a Neutral rating and $40 price target. The firm cites the competitive backdrop of the cloud infrastructure market and DigitalOcean's exposure to \"macro-sensitive\" individual and smaller customers for the Neutral rating.Citi reinstated coverage of Aon plc (AON) with a Neutral rating and $309 price target. The firm is cautious on the company's organic growth underperformance, near-term disruption from the acquisition of NFP and multi-year transformation programUBS initiated coverage of Elastic (ESTC) with a Buy rating and $135 price target. Elastic has a better artificial intelligence opportunity than is currently priced into the stock, the firm tells investors in a research note. ",

Motley Fool Money starts now. I'm Dylan Lewis, and I'm joined over the airwaves by Motley Fool Analyst Jason Moser. Jason, thanks for joining me.Jason Moser: Hey, Dylan, glad to be here. How's everything?Dylan Lewis: Things are good. We've got some deal-making going on in private equity, we've got the Global EV Race heating up, and we've got to look at a lesser-known player in online advertising today. Jason, I love it when we check the news on a Monday morning, and we've got a fun deal to unpack, certainly the case today. Website building suites, Squarespace will be going private, thanks to an all-cash deal from private equity firm Permira, valuing the company at around $6.9 billion. Seems like a nice time for us to reflect on Squarespace as a publicly traded company, it has not exactly been a world-beater and went public at a tough time during the peak of the pandemic. What do you think Permira sees in Squarespace's business?Jason Moser: It's not been the greatest time for Squarespace, a very competitive industry in website building, and what comes with that. I think that Permira likely sees a couple of things, I think first and foremost, they see this massive market opportunity. When you look at Squarespace's S1, for example, back when they went public in 2021 when they filed that S1, based on data from Intuit, they were estimating around 800 million small to medium-sized businesses in a medium-term addressable market of $150 billion at least. Those are big numbers, and that's not something that is all Squarespace's opportunity. This is where the puck is headed, right? When it comes to retail, when it comes to commerce, it's headed online, and if you own a small or medium-sized business and you don't have a web presence, you are leaving something out there, you need to get on that. Squarespace obviously is one tool that can help get that done, yes, it's been a difficult time for the company as a publicly traded company, but I would imagine that Permira sees this attractive market opportunity, and maybe has some ideas in regard to strategy in ways that they can perhaps improve the business, when you're chasing a market opportunity of $150 billion as quoted, it's understandable to want a little slice of that.Story continuesDylan Lewis: To be clear, Squarespace is not alone in being a company that has struggled in this zone, I think the nearest competitor for them is a company like Wix. Both of those businesses are, it depends on your basis type stocks, where if you've owned it over the last two years or so, you're probably feeling pretty good if your basis is tied to some of the pandemic highs, probably not feeling quite as good.Jason Moser: Yeah.Dylan Lewis: But if you expand that out, and you get out just beyond the site builders and you start thinking more about companies that specialize in e-commerce, bring BigCommerce, bring Shopify in the mix, similar story there too. How do you look at these companies that are good at one specific thing in the zone, versus the more built for shopping, more e-commerce, more breadth-oriented offerings?Jason Moser: If you look at the website building opportunity, that on its own probably isn't the most attractive out there. We saw, for example, Block, formerly Square, acquired Weebly sometime back, which was essentially the same thing, I even remember building a website on Weebly back in the day, and I was impressed with how easy it was, and how robust you can make it, and they had the freemium version, and then you can upgrade and pay subscription fees to get more features. And I think that's the key to it all, on its own, maybe it's not the most attractive, but when you consider the opportunity to build additional value add features, and additional revenue streams, and so thinking about things like ads, or payments, or what have you, then it starts to become a little bit more palatable because again, those are large market opportunities on their own, and contend to be more recurring, given the nature of the actual business in that online space.Dylan Lewis: If you're looking for details, shares are up 13% to just over $43, the deal price was $44. Jason, it seems like there's a high level of confidence that this one is going to be happening, there is not a lot of uncertainty being priced into the stock right now.Jason Moser: No, I don't think so. This is a situation where you'd be at Squarespace competing against some very tough incumbents out there, Shopify among others. When you look at the fundamentals of the business, it's not a bad business, but it's a young business and it's still trying to establish its own market position there, they've grown revenue at about 17% annualized over the last three years. Not bad, but probably not something necessarily to write home about. Still working toward profitability, but worth noting, that it is cash-flow positive even after you account for stock-based compensation. I think that when you look at this acquisition, it's not the craziest valuation for a business like this, it's somewhere around between six and seven times sales. To me, it does make sense to go ahead and take a chance on this now when the valuation is looking a little bit more attractive, given that Squarespace has had such a difficult time as a publicly traded company.Dylan Lewis: It's a nice opportunity for us to check in a little bit on the private equity space. In researching the show, I saw a piece from S&P market intelligence, that at year-end, of 2023, private equity firms were sitting on nearly 2.6 trillion in dry powder, a lot of cash on the sidelines, basically double what they had in 2016, and I think an all-time high for the category. This is not the first time we have seen a tech company get taken private, especially one that had come out to some fanfare on the public markets. Qualtrics was out as a public company for about two years before it got scooped up in 2023, I think Toshiba was also taken private in 2023. Do you expect that we'll see some more announcements like this with how much money is sitting on the sidelines right now, Jason?Jason Moser: Yeah, that's a lot of cabbage insight. I think just by that alone, yes, we are likely to see more deals that are in the future. Permira, they didn't want that money just sitting there, that money has to go to work doing something, and I think now we will likely see more deals materialize, we've got a lot of companies out there with very interesting prospects, but just very young business models, I think Squarespace fits into this category, some interesting prospects there, which is still a young business finding its way, and now we're in a bit more of a risk-off environment, it's not like we've seen over the last few years where investors just had this unquestionable thirst for risk, it's a little bit of a different situation now, what that means, what comes along with that, valuation starts to look a little bit more enticing. So it makes a lot of sense that private equity is taking a very close look at a lot of these businesses, I would imagine we'll start to see slowly here through the rest of 2024 in into 2025, I'd imagine we'll be talking about some more deals here on the show in the coming months and quarters.Dylan Lewis: Over to a space where business might be a little bit tougher going forward, EVs reports this week that President Biden will announce a new set of tariffs on EVs, solar equipment, and medical supplies coming from China in parts to protect American industry and also in the interest of national security. Jason, EVs are getting the headline and are really showing up in a lot of the reporting on this, but I think we do need to put it relatively plainly. There are not a lot of EVs coming into the United States from China right now.Jason Moser: No, not at all. I think it's somewhere in the neighborhood of a couple of thousand, it's not even material, and that rings true for most of the markets where these tariffs will occur. This is a recurring theme we've seen over the last several years, has been for a lot of companies that are looking to reduce their dependence on China through supply chains, figuring out ways to diversify their businesses away from dependent necessarily on that Chinese economy, but we've seen Apple making big inroads with India, for example, not only for consumers, but in regard to production as well. I think you mentioned the word headline, I think this is a headline, but there's not a whole heck of a lot more to it, on its own, this stuff isn't terribly impactful, like you said, we're not bringing a lot of EVs in from China, the solar cell market, not a big deal there, it's not something where this is going to impact one side terribly, but it seems to me at least they're trying to hit this before it becomes a problem; we're talking about things like solar and EVs and whatnot, we're talking about markets that are still developing in representing attractive growth opportunities, and so just trying to get ahead of this before it does become a problem, and we become too dependent on an economy outside of our own.Dylan Lewis: I think the concern here is just that the sheer market dynamics of the US is generally at a higher price point for most of the EVs that we're seeing, we know a lot of the cars that are coming out of China are a bit cheaper, while it does not have an immediate impact. I do know when we look at things like tariffs and trade negotiations, Jason, there tends to be a little bit of, you do this, I do that. I can't help but wonder what type of response we may see related to these tariffs, because I think at present the tariff is about 25%, that could escalate up to about 100% under this new plan, I have to imagine that China will respond to that, and there will be some effect for companies in the United States.Jason Moser: I suspect you're right. A tit for tat deal there, a lot of politics, and even more so, a lot of diplomacy that comes with things like this. We see two different aspects of this from the economic side of things, but then also the political side of things, and speaking of headlines, these are headlines, I suspect we're going to see more and more of this type of back-and-forth here over the next several months because if I remember correctly, there's I think an election in November.Dylan Lewis: I've seen some reporting on that.Jason Moser: Relative to modest consequences, I'm not sure, I think this is one of those, and we will continue to see the back-and-forth nature of it, and I think the key for things like this all boils down to diplomacy. You don't want to look at this as we just want to go it on our own, but by the same token, there is a protectionist nature here when it comes to these developing markets, and we want to make sure that we are not overly reliant on anyone in particular, and the history with China, and the government there is. How do I put this diplomatically, Dylan, it's volatile [laughs]. Let's just say it's volatile. I'd imagine we'll continue to see this back-and-forth. But hopefully, it's nothing that's too terribly debilitating for either side.Dylan Lewis: Fair to say that businesses that have a fair exposure to China, that volatility will continue.Jason Moser: I suspect, and I think we're going to continue to see language riddled throughout these earnings calls over the next several quarters. Companies again, they're trying to diversify away from that reliance on that China's supply chain, and that makes perfect sense. Particularly when we've seen the impacts when those supply chain were so dependent on one particular entity, one particular economy in regard to supply chains, and then those supply chains break, it can have really long-reaching impacts and that's something worth avoiding if we can.Dylan Lewis: Our final story for the news roundup for some retail investors, the times and the portfolio dashboards are changing. Schwab's TD Ameritrade migration nearly complete. Over the weekend, I think just shy of two million TD customers moved over to Schwab. Jason, marks the end of an era for some folks in their investing journey. I saw a lot of people on X lamenting that they were so used to checking in on TD and are now being switched over to Schwab. Now that we finally have all these customers over, we know it was part of Schwab's grander strategy, how should we be looking at this?Jason Moser: Well, I for one hope that this is it. Because I was a Scottrade user, Scottrade got acquired by TD Ameritrade and then I had to get used to TD Ameritrade and I was like, TD Ameritrade is not so bad. This is work, wait, now it's getting acquired by Schwab. Fortunately, I guess I was spiked over to Schwab much earlier, so I've had a chance to get familiar with that user interface. I will say whether it's web-based, or app-based, I think Schwab has a terrific interface. I'm able to get everything done I want to get done, but this is really a story of the strong getting stronger. Schwab is one of the biggest financial entities out there in the world, and when I talk about big, we're talking about 35 million active brokerage accounts. You're talking more than five million workplace participant plans. You're talking about two million banking accounts and close to nine trillion dollars in client assets. This is a massive company and bringing TD Ameritrade into the fold, it's understandable. Consolidation in this space is something we've been talking about for a while, so clearly Schwab saw a lot of value there in TD Ameritrade. To your point there, in seeing the reactions on Twitter or wherever else about people disappointed that they have to leave that TD Ameritrade interface, and well, maybe that's just goes to show TD Ameritrade was doing something right. Maybe Schwab made a wise choice in bringing TD Ameritrade into the fold. But this absolutely is something that makes one of the biggest banks out there even bigger, even stronger. I think folks who've been moved over to Schwab, there's a little bit of a learning curve, but you get used to it quick, I'm sure.Dylan Lewis: If there's anything that's true over time, that people hate change.Jason Moser: We all do. We all do until we figure out, well, maybe it wasn't so bad.Dylan Lewis: Jason Moser, thanks for joining me today.Jason Moser: Thank you.Ricky Mulvey: Ricky Mulvey with Motley Fool Money here.

Up next, Fool analysts, Asit Sharma joins Ricky Mulvey for a look at PubMatic, an advertising company creating trillions of impressions per quarter, and facing off against some trillion-dollar companies. Asit, before we get into PubMatic, a lot of this Ad platform stuff is a little confusing. Can you explain what a sell side Ad platform does? Who are the customers?Asit Sharma: Absolutely. A sell-side platform, Ricky, is a platform that represents publishers. Think about a company like Yahoo!, which is a company that PubMatic has had a long relationship with, that's a publisher. They have inventory on their web pages, and they want to sell that inventory. You can see that's differentiated from what we call the demand side. Those are advertisers who want to advertise and reach end-users. It's a pretty simple demarcation between the two. Publishers on one side, that's sell side, buyers are advertisers on the other side, that's the demand side.Ricky Mulvey: This is one of those companies I've probably experienced, but maybe I don't know where. Where might I have seen a PubMatic ad?Asit Sharma: Let's see if, again, you've been on any of Yahoo's sites, you'll likely have seen one of these ads, maybe News Corp. Any number of publishers with acronyms that really we don't come into contact with in the wild, so let me go to some other examples where you probably have seen some of the inventory that's represented on this platform. If you've played games on Zynga or Electronic Arts, we've seen those. Coming soon, Klarna. If you use Klarna, you'll see ads that are generated through PubMatic's platform. Same with Roblox, which also just announced a partnership with this company. If you've ever ventured onto over-the-top streaming sites, there several which PubMatic represents. AMC Networks, Barstool Sports, Major League Baseball, the Cox Media Group. Their reach is really pretty wide. I'm going to just say that if you spent more than a few hours on the internet or a connected device of some sort, you've probably seen an ad that came through a PubMatic server.Ricky Mulvey: That's a lot of the internet, but this company claims they're doing 58 trillion impressions in a quarter, which sounds like a lot. How is that possible? I know you've listed their customers, but how is that even possible?Asit Sharma: Well, think about, Ricky, not just the internet but connected TV, so we mentioned streaming. The number of hours that we as a society spend on the internet, on TV shows that aren't through traditional linear TV, through gaming, all of this amounts to an amazing, just incomprehensible amount of inventory. If you think of each click as representing a destination or each minute that you might spend on a streaming platform is a potential to see an ad? Multiply that out by maybe hundreds of millions of people or billions of people, since we've got eight billion people on the planet, and the math starts to work out crazily enough. I don't want to go back to the old days of seeing how much time I spent on my phone. I used to do this and installed a minimalist app after that. But when we start extrapolating the math, actually it's like that's not a big number at all.Ricky Mulvey: Fool favorite The Trade Desk, which is on the other side of ad buying. So do these companies have a relationship? Is PubMatic selling ads to the buyers on The Trade Desk?Asit Sharma: Yes, it is. In fact, PubMatic integrates with many platforms that are on the demand side, but The Trade Desk is one of the biggest integrations that it has. So think of it as being able to link both sides of that sell-side and demand side equation that I talked about. You have to play nice with the business model on the other side. That's something that PubMatic has done a great job of. They actually cooperated with The Trade Desk a few years ago when The Trade Desk was trying to promote its solution to cookies, we had all the signals that Google Chrome was going to dispense with cookies. They wouldn't follow you around the internet anymore. But some new technologies would have to come into place that would protect user privacy and also let advertisers get to us. PubMatic really worked with The Trade Desk and several other major players in the industry to have technology. It's called UID 2.0. It's just one of many that PubMatic works with, but having this kind of positive frenemy relationship with the other side, I think is one of the things that's enabled them to succeed.Ricky Mulvey: A lot of the Internet economy is winner-take-all, or there's one or two big winners. And then all of the other companies seem to be left to the side. It's difficult to be the second most popular bookseller on the web, or the third most popular ride-hailing app in the United States. On this sell side, which is a space I've seen but I'm less familiar with, is PubMatic the big winner, or are there, or are there other competitors for investors to watch?Asit Sharma: I think there's a big winner so far. There is Magnite, which was formed from the merger of two different companies several years ago. There's a company called Criteo. These are decent business models. But PubMatic, I think, has differentiated itself through really astute investments in technology which can get into, in a moment here. By doing that, I think they've won more credits with publishers. One example is they now have something that blurs the line between demand side and sell side. When they offer new product up to publishers, they, they get a pretty rapid uptake. I think you can consider them in terms of potential and profitability and probably to now share of the market is on this smaller sell-side. I can think of them as a top dog.Ricky Mulvey: Speaking of technology investments, this is a rare tech company that's actually adding to its headcount this year. Growing their employee base by 11%. Now they're making moves on where those folks are going with generative AI. What do you make of this move in the investments PubMatic's making?Asit Sharma: I think it's solid. On one hand, you can say, gee, maybe the company is having to spend more to make more money. But PubMatic has a history of investing during various cycles. This last cycle, when interest rates spike, inflation spiked and advertisers pulled back, all these stocks got pummeled. PubMatic was working on its platform during that time, they were actually a very early adopter of generative AI. They've got a team of engineers out in Poona, which is close to Mumbai in India. They were really into using this technology to become more efficient. It's a very cost-efficient company. It's always been profitable. It generates a lot of free cash flow per revenue dollar. I see this as really coming to the end of the cycle of investment in capital expenditure. I've had a chance to speak to the CEO, Rajeev Goel, a few times. In the last time I spoke to him last year, he told me, look, we are in an investment cycle and that's going to have its end as well. We'll have to start reinvesting in capex, capital expenditure, but for now, we've made those investments, now we have to optimize them. Part of that logically is hiring more engineers to reduce the cost of impressions for advertisers, which helps their bottom line too, because they sell more of these clicks. I think given their history, it's a move you can have confidence in, but you have to watch it too, they have to get a yield on that investment.Ricky Mulvey: Because if you look at the income statement, as this company has dramatically grown revenue, it hasn't necessarily grown its operating income even though it's profitable. It's still may be experiencing growth pains or do they have a spending problem?Asit Sharma: I don't think it's a spending problem historically, they actually have generated decent operating income, but we're I think a couple of years into that cycle now that I mentioned before, it's really the dip in advertising demand that hit their income statement and you see him solely coming out of that. The forerunner of that is cashflows. So free cash-flow hit a trough. It tripled in the last quarter. I think the margin on a book basis, a GAAP basis, is going to follow as now we see more advertisers spending. As that spend goes up, you'll see them capture the incremental profit. I think that's more of a cyclical thing when you look back at their entire history, even before they were a public company. We got a glimpse into that, into that when they had their S1 a few years ago. But I think the point behind your question is correct though if you're growing in a competitive environment, investors are going to want to see, if this is your narrative and that is their narrative, when this advertising spend keeps growing, it's got to show up in the bottom-line. We're going to need to see that bottom-line profit.Ricky Mulvey: Then as we wrap up any other flags, good or bad, greed flags, orange flag, yellow flags, red flags you're keeping an eye on with this company?Asit Sharma: I'm very fond of this company, Ricky. I've been following it for a number of years ever since it went public, recommended it in services I work in. But you have to be clear-eyed about this. The biggest threat to a business like PubMatic may not be what looks obvious. The obvious thing is The Trade Desk can step over into the supply side. In fact, as I mentioned, PubMatic has a product that's steps into the demand side. Trade Desk has its product to try to play with publishers themselves. But really the threat is more the big giants. We have Google, which is a force in the digital advertising field, and you have companies like Microsoft. Microsoft was chosen to act as sort of a sell-side and demand side platform for Netflix. That's a big chunk of business that rightfully maybe should have gone to PubMatic and The Trade Desk. So whenever Big Tech throws its weight around, that the little fish feel what it is to be a minnow. I think that to succeed The Trade Desk, less so, PubMatic more so is going to have to be able to navigate some waters where Microsoft can take what it's done with a Netflix and lift and shift that to another big entity. I know we're almost out of time, but I want to put in one pathway that PubMatic can actually do this. That's through retail media advertising. They've been very quick to work with a growing number of retailers who want to advertise or let their vendors advertise to customers. I think that's a wave that they will be able to ride. The second is something that Rajeev Goel has been very intent on, which is called supply path optimization. That's cutting out all the middlemen in the buying process. On the supply side, he's been pushing the company to do this, which is a higher-margin business. So each quarter you see more and more revenue is a function of supply path optimization and there's your margin, Ricky, in the long run, that's where a lot of the profit is going to come from.Ricky Mulvey: But there is a significant problem with the connected TV story though. If you have Microsoft throwing its weight around with Netflix, because that's the story PubMatic's telling investors is, hey, more ad impressions on TV. This is where people are spending time and this is where we're selling. The part we're not hearing it as much about is there's trillion-dollar companies who are also looking at that market.Asit Sharma: Totally. This is really such a opportunistic market, meaning that there's opportunity there for the tech players, but there's also opportunistic revenue from big tech giants. So the one thing I think PubMatic would answer back to that is it's a very fast-growing market. There's room for a smaller player to keep growing, even as giants take a bigger chunk of the business. But I think it's a risk when I think you're right to call that out as a risk, so we'll keep following it. I think it's got a bright future, but it's not like a slam dunk future. I think the company is really capable, management is capable, that product is good, the tech is good. But you have to put all those pieces together and get out there and fight against these big whales every day.Dylan Lewis: As always, people on the program may own stocks mentioned in the Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against.

money is brought to you by squarespace  which will be brought to you soon by  permira of private equity  motley fool money starts now  i m dylan lewis  and i m joined over the airwaves by motley fool analyst jason moser  jason  thanks for joining me jason moser  hey  dylan  glad to be here  how s everything dylan lewis  things are good  we ve got some deal making going on in private equity  we ve got the global ev race heating up  and we ve got to look at a lesser known player in online advertising today  jason  i love it when we check the news on a monday morning  and we ve got a fun deal to unpack  certainly the case today  website building suites  squarespace will be going private  thanks to an all cash deal from private equity firm permira  valuing the company at around  6 9 billion  seems like a nice time for us to reflect on squarespace as a publicly traded company  it has not exactly been a world beater and went public at a tough time during the peak of the pandemic  what do you think permira sees in squarespace s business jason moser  it s not been the greatest time for squarespace  a very competitive industry in website building  and what comes with that  i think that permira likely sees a couple of things  i think first and foremost  they see this massive market opportunity  when you look at squarespace s s1  for example  back when they went public in 2021 when they filed that s1  based on data from intuit  they were estimating around 800 million small to medium sized businesses in a medium term addressable market of  150 billion at least  those are big numbers  and that s not something that is all squarespace s opportunity  this is where the puck is headed  right  when it comes to retail  when it comes to commerce  it s headed online  and if you own a small or medium sized business and you don t have a web presence  you are leaving something out there  you need to get on that  squarespace obviously is one tool that can help get that done  yes  it s been a difficult time for the company as a publicly traded company  but i would imagine that permira sees this attractive market opportunity  and maybe has some ideas in regard to strategy in ways that they can perhaps improve the business  when you re chasing a market opportunity of  150 billion as quoted  it s understandable to want a little slice of that story continuesdylan lewis  to be clear  squarespace is not alone in being a company that has struggled in this zone  i think the nearest competitor for them is a company like wix  both of those businesses are  it depends on your basis type stocks  where if you ve owned it over the last two years or so  you re probably feeling pretty good if your basis is tied to some of the pandemic highs  probably not feeling quite as good jason moser  yeah dylan lewis  but if you expand that out  and you get out just beyond the site builders and you start thinking more about companies that specialize in e commerce  bring bigcommerce  bring shopify in the mix  similar story there too  how do you look at these companies that are good at one specific thing in the zone  versus the more built for shopping  more e commerce  more breadth oriented offerings jason moser  if you look at the website building opportunity  that on its own probably isn t the most attractive out there  we saw  for example  block  formerly square  acquired weebly sometime back  which was essentially the same thing  i even remember building a website on weebly back in the day  and i was impressed with how easy it was  and how robust you can make it  and they had the freemium version  and then you can upgrade and pay subscription fees to get more features  and i think that s the key to it all  on its own  maybe it s not the most attractive  but when you consider the opportunity to build additional value add features  and additional revenue streams  and so thinking about things like ads  or payments  or what have you  then it starts to become a little bit more palatable because again  those are large market opportunities on their own  and contend to be more recurring  given the nature of the actual business in that online space dylan lewis  if you re looking for details  shares are up 13  to just over  43  the deal price was  44  jason  it seems like there s a high level of confidence that this one is going to be happening  there is not a lot of uncertainty being priced into the stock right now jason moser  no  i don t think so  this is a situation where you d be at squarespace competing against some very tough incumbents out there  shopify among others  when you look at the fundamentals of the business  it s not a bad business  but it s a young business and it s still trying to establish its own market position there  they ve grown revenue at about 17  annualized over the last three years  not bad  but probably not something necessarily to write home about  still working toward profitability  but worth noting  that it is cash flow positive even after you account for stock based compensation  i think that when you look at this acquisition  it s not the craziest valuation for a business like this  it s somewhere around between six and seven times sales  to me  it does make sense to go ahead and take a chance on this now when the valuation is looking a little bit more attractive  given that squarespace has had such a difficult time as a publicly traded company dylan lewis  it s a nice opportunity for us to check in a little bit on the private equity space  in researching the show  i saw a piece from s p market intelligence  that at year end  of 2023  private equity firms were sitting on nearly 2 6 trillion in dry powder  a lot of cash on the sidelines  basically double what they had in 2016  and i think an all time high for the category  this is not the first time we have seen a tech company get taken private  especially one that had come out to some fanfare on the public markets  qualtrics was out as a public company for about two years before it got scooped up in 2023  i think toshiba was also taken private in 2023  do you expect that we ll see some more announcements like this with how much money is sitting on the sidelines right now  jason jason moser  yeah  that s a lot of cabbage insight  i think just by that alone  yes  we are likely to see more deals that are in the future  permira  they didn t want that money just sitting there  that money has to go to work doing something  and i think now we will likely see more deals materialize  we ve got a lot of companies out there with very interesting prospects  but just very young business models  i think squarespace fits into this category  some interesting prospects there  which is still a young business finding its way  and now we re in a bit more of a risk off environment  it s not like we ve seen over the last few years where investors just had this unquestionable thirst for risk  it s a little bit of a different situation now  what that means  what comes along with that  valuation starts to look a little bit more enticing  so it makes a lot of sense that private equity is taking a very close look at a lot of these businesses  i would imagine we ll start to see slowly here through the rest of 2024 in into 2025  i d imagine we ll be talking about some more deals here on the show in the coming months and quarters dylan lewis  over to a space where business might be a little bit tougher going forward  evs reports this week that president biden will announce a new set of tariffs on evs  solar equipment  and medical supplies coming from china in parts to protect american industry and also in the interest of national security  jason  evs are getting the headline and are really showing up in a lot of the reporting on this  but i think we do need to put it relatively plainly  there are not a lot of evs coming into the united states from china right now jason moser  no  not at all  i think it s somewhere in the neighborhood of a couple of thousand  it s not even material  and that rings true for most of the markets where these tariffs will occur  this is a recurring theme we ve seen over the last several years  has been for a lot of companies that are looking to reduce their dependence on china through supply chains  figuring out ways to diversify their businesses away from dependent necessarily on that chinese economy  but we ve seen apple making big inroads with india  for example  not only for consumers  but in regard to production as well  i think you mentioned the word headline  i think this is a headline  but there s not a whole heck of a lot more to it  on its own  this stuff isn t terribly impactful  like you said  we re not bringing a lot of evs in from china  the solar cell market  not a big deal there  it s not something where this is going to impact one side terribly  but it seems to me at least they re trying to hit this before it becomes a problem  we re talking about things like solar and evs and whatnot  we re talking about markets that are still developing in representing attractive growth opportunities  and so just trying to get ahead of this before it does become a problem  and we become too dependent on an economy outside of our own dylan lewis  i think the concern here is just that the sheer market dynamics of the us is generally at a higher price point for most of the evs that we re seeing  we know a lot of the cars that are coming out of china are a bit cheaper  while it does not have an immediate impact  i do know when we look at things like tariffs and trade negotiations  jason  there tends to be a little bit of  you do this  i do that  i can t help but wonder what type of response we may see related to these tariffs  because i think at present the tariff is about 25   that could escalate up to about 100  under this new plan  i have to imagine that china will respond to that  and there will be some effect for companies in the united states jason moser  i suspect you re right  a tit for tat deal there  a lot of politics  and even more so  a lot of diplomacy that comes with things like this  we see two different aspects of this from the economic side of things  but then also the political side of things  and speaking of headlines  these are headlines  i suspect we re going to see more and more of this type of back and forth here over the next several months because if i remember correctly  there s i think an election in november dylan lewis  i ve seen some reporting on that jason moser  relative to modest consequences  i m not sure  i think this is one of those  and we will continue to see the back and forth nature of it  and i think the key for things like this all boils down to diplomacy  you don t want to look at this as we just want to go it on our own  but by the same token  there is a protectionist nature here when it comes to these developing markets  and we want to make sure that we are not overly reliant on anyone in particular  and the history with china  and the government there is  how do i put this diplomatically  dylan  it s volatile  laughs   let s just say it s volatile  i d imagine we ll continue to see this back and forth  but hopefully  it s nothing that s too terribly debilitating for either side dylan lewis  fair to say that businesses that have a fair exposure to china  that volatility will continue jason moser  i suspect  and i think we re going to continue to see language riddled throughout these earnings calls over the next several quarters  companies again  they re trying to diversify away from that reliance on that china s supply chain  and that makes perfect sense  particularly when we ve seen the impacts when those supply chain were so dependent on one particular entity  one particular economy in regard to supply chains  and then those supply chains break  it can have really long reaching impacts and that s something worth avoiding if we can dylan lewis  our final story for the news roundup for some retail investors  the times and the portfolio dashboards are changing  schwab s td ameritrade migration nearly complete  over the weekend  i think just shy of two million td customers moved over to schwab  jason  marks the end of an era for some folks in their investing journey  i saw a lot of people on x lamenting that they were so used to checking in on td and are now being switched over to schwab  now that we finally have all these customers over  we know it was part of schwab s grander strategy  how should we be looking at this jason moser  well  i for one hope that this is it  because i was a scottrade user  scottrade got acquired by td ameritrade and then i had to get used to td ameritrade and i was like  td ameritrade is not so bad  this is work  wait  now it s getting acquired by schwab  fortunately  i guess i was spiked over to schwab much earlier  so i ve had a chance to get familiar with that user interface  i will say whether it s web based  or app based  i think schwab has a terrific interface  i m able to get everything done i want to get done  but this is really a story of the strong getting stronger  schwab is one of the biggest financial entities out there in the world  and when i talk about big  we re talking about 35 million active brokerage accounts  you re talking more than five million workplace participant plans  you re talking about two million banking accounts and close to nine trillion dollars in client assets  this is a massive company and bringing td ameritrade into the fold  it s understandable  consolidation in this space is something we ve been talking about for a while  so clearly schwab saw a lot of value there in td ameritrade  to your point there  in seeing the reactions on twitter or wherever else about people disappointed that they have to leave that td ameritrade interface  and well  maybe that s just goes to show td ameritrade was doing something right  maybe schwab made a wise choice in bringing td ameritrade into the fold  but this absolutely is something that makes one of the biggest banks out there even bigger  even stronger  i think folks who ve been moved over to schwab  there s a little bit of a learning curve  but you get used to it quick  i m sure dylan lewis  if there s anything that s true over time  that people hate change jason moser  we all do  we all do until we figure out  well  maybe it wasn t so bad dylan lewis  jason moser  thanks for joining me today jason moser  thank you ricky mulvey  ricky mulvey with motley fool money here  i love the investing side of managing money  but the personal finance bit is honestly a chore  i ve checked out some personal finance apps and

lewis  coming up  the internet economy is all about eyeballs  up next  fool analysts  asit sharma joins ricky mulvey for a look at pubmatic  an advertising company creating trillions of impressions per quarter  and facing off against some trillion dollar companies  asit  before we get into pubmatic  a lot of this ad platform stuff is a little confusing  can you explain what a sell side ad platform does  who are the customers asit sharma  absolutely  a sell side platform  ricky  is a platform that represents publishers  think about a company like yahoo   which is a company that pubmatic has had a long relationship with  that s a publisher  they have inventory on their web pages  and they want to sell that inventory  you can see that s differentiated from what we call the demand side  those are advertisers who want to advertise and reach end users  it s a pretty simple demarcation between the two  publishers on one side  that s sell side  buyers are advertisers on the other side  that s the demand side ricky mulvey  this is one of those companies i ve probably experienced  but maybe i don t know where  where might i have seen a pubmatic ad asit sharma  let s see if  again  you ve been on any of yahoo s sites  you ll likely have seen one of these ads  maybe news corp  any number of publishers with acronyms that really we don t come into contact with in the wild  so let me go to some other examples where you probably have seen some of the inventory that s represented on this platform  if you ve played games on zynga or electronic arts  we ve seen those  coming soon  klarna  if you use klarna  you ll see ads that are generated through pubmatic s platform  same with roblox  which also just announced a partnership with this company  if you ve ever ventured onto over the top streaming sites  there several which pubmatic represents  amc networks  barstool sports  major league baseball  the cox media group  their reach is really pretty wide  i m going to just say that if you spent more than a few hours on the internet or a connected device of some sort  you ve probably seen an ad that came through a pubmatic server ricky mulvey  that s a lot of the internet  but this company claims they re doing 58 trillion impressions in a quarter  which sounds like a lot  how is that possible  i know you ve listed their customers  but how is that even possible asit sharma  well  think about  ricky  not just the internet but connected tv  so we mentioned streaming  the number of hours that we as a society spend on the internet  on tv shows that aren t through traditional linear tv  through gaming  all of this amounts to an amazing  just incomprehensible amount of inventory  if you think of each click as representing a destination or each minute that you might spend on a streaming platform is a potential to see an ad  multiply that out by maybe hundreds of millions of people or billions of people  since we ve got eight billion people on the planet  and the math starts to work out crazily enough  i don t want to go back to the old days of seeing how much time i spent on my phone  i used to do this and installed a minimalist app after that  but when we start extrapolating the math  actually it s like that s not a big number at all ricky mulvey  fool favorite the trade desk  which is on the other side of ad buying  so do these companies have a relationship  is pubmatic selling ads to the buyers on the trade desk asit sharma  yes  it is  in fact  pubmatic integrates with many platforms that are on the demand side  but the trade desk is one of the biggest integrations that it has  so think of it as being able to link both sides of that sell side and demand side equation that i talked about  you have to play nice with the business model on the other side  that s something that pubmatic has done a great job of  they actually cooperated with the trade desk a few years ago when the trade desk was trying to promote its solution to cookies  we had all the signals that google chrome was going to dispense with cookies  they wouldn t follow you around the internet anymore  but some new technologies would have to come into place that would protect user privacy and also let advertisers get to us  pubmatic really worked with the trade desk and several other major players in the industry to have technology  it s called uid 2 0  it s just one of many that pubmatic works with  but having this kind of positive frenemy relationship with the other side  i think is one of the things that s enabled them to succeed ricky mulvey  a lot of the internet economy is winner take all  or there s one or two big winners  and then all of the other companies seem to be left to the side  it s difficult to be the second most popular bookseller on the web  or the third most popular ride hailing app in the united states  on this sell side  which is a space i ve seen but i m less familiar with  is pubmatic the big winner  or are there  or are there other competitors for investors to watch asit sharma  i think there s a big winner so far  there is magnite  which was formed from the merger of two different companies several years ago  there s a company called criteo  these are decent business models  but pubmatic  i think  has differentiated itself through really astute investments in technology which can get into  in a moment here  by doing that  i think they ve won more credits with publishers  one example is they now have something that blurs the line between demand side and sell side  when they offer new product up to publishers  they  they get a pretty rapid uptake  i think you can consider them in terms of potential and profitability and probably to now share of the market is on this smaller sell side  i can think of them as a top dog ricky mulvey  speaking of technology investments  this is a rare tech company that s actually adding to its headcount this year  growing their employee base by 11   now they re making moves on where those folks are going with generative ai  what do you make of this move in the investments pubmatic s making asit sharma  i think it s solid  on one hand  you can say  gee  maybe the company is having to spend more to make more money  but pubmatic has a history of investing during various cycles  this last cycle  when interest rates spike  inflation spiked and advertisers pulled back  all these stocks got pummeled  pubmatic was working on its platform during that time  they were actually a very early adopter of generative ai  they ve got a team of engineers out in poona  which is close to mumbai in india  they were really into using this technology to become more efficient  it s a very cost efficient company  it s always been profitable  it generates a lot of free cash flow per revenue dollar  i see this as really coming to the end of the cycle of investment in capital expenditure  i ve had a chance to speak to the ceo  rajeev goel  a few times  in the last time i spoke to him last year  he told me  look  we are in an investment cycle and that s going to have its end as well  we ll have to start reinvesting in capex  capital expenditure  but for now  we ve made those investments  now we have to optimize them  part of that logically is hiring more engineers to reduce the cost of impressions for advertisers  which helps their bottom line too  because they sell more of these clicks  i think given their history  it s a move you can have confidence in  but you have to watch it too  they have to get a yield on that investment ricky mulvey  because if you look at the income statement  as this company has dramatically grown revenue  it hasn t necessarily grown its operating income even though it s profitable  it s still may be experiencing growth pains or do they have a spending problem asit sharma  i don t think it s a spending problem historically  they actually have generated decent operating income  but we re i think a couple of years into that cycle now that i mentioned before  it s really the dip in advertising demand that hit their income statement and you see him solely coming out of that  the forerunner of that is cashflows  so free cash flow hit a trough  it tripled in the last quarter  i think the margin on a book basis  a gaap basis  is going to follow as now we see more advertisers spending  as that spend goes up  you ll see them capture the incremental profit  i think that s more of a cyclical thing when you look back at their entire history  even before they were a public company  we got a glimpse into that  into that when they had their s1 a few years ago  but i think the point behind your question is correct though if you re growing in a competitive environment  investors are going to want to see  if this is your narrative and that is their narrative  when this advertising spend keeps growing  it s got to show up in the bottom line  we re going to need to see that bottom line profit ricky mulvey  then as we wrap up any other flags  good or bad  greed flags  orange flag  yellow flags  red flags you re keeping an eye on with this company asit sharma  i m very fond of this company  ricky  i ve been following it for a number of years ever since it went public  recommended it in services i work in  but you have to be clear eyed about this  the biggest threat to a business like pubmatic may not be what looks obvious  the obvious thing is the trade desk can step over into the supply side  in fact  as i mentioned  pubmatic has a product that s steps into the demand side  trade desk has its product to try to play with publishers themselves  but really the threat is more the big giants  we have google  which is a force in the digital advertising field  and you have companies like microsoft  microsoft was chosen to act as sort of a sell side and demand side platform for netflix  that s a big chunk of business that rightfully maybe should have gone to pubmatic and the trade desk  so whenever big tech throws its weight around  that the little fish feel what it is to be a minnow  i think that to succeed the trade desk  less so  pubmatic more so is going to have to be able to navigate some waters where microsoft can take what it s done with a netflix and lift and shift that to another big entity  i know we re almost out of time  but i want to put in one pathway that pubmatic can actually do this  that s through retail media advertising  they ve been very quick to work with a growing number of retailers who want to advertise or let their vendors advertise to customers  i think that s a wave that they will be able to ride  the second is something that rajeev goel has been very intent on  which is called supply path optimization  that s cutting out all the middlemen in the buying process  on the supply side  he s been pushing the company to do this  which is a higher margin business  so each quarter you see more and more revenue is a function of supply path optimization and there s your margin  ricky  in the long run  that s where a lot of the profit is going to come from ricky mulvey  but there is a significant problem with the connected tv story though  if you have microsoft throwing its weight around with netflix  because that s the story pubmatic s telling investors is  hey  more ad impressions on tv  this is where people are spending time and this is where we re selling  the part we re not hearing it as much about is there s trillion dollar companies who are also looking at that market asit sharma  totally  this is really such a opportunistic market  meaning that there s opportunity there for the tech players  but there s also opportunistic revenue from big tech giants  so the one thing i think pubmatic would answer back to that is it s a very fast growing market  there s room for a smaller player to keep growing  even as giants take a bigger chunk of the business  but i think it s a risk when i think you re right to call that out as a risk  so we ll keep following it  i think it s got a bright future  but it s not like a slam dunk future  i think the company is really capable  management is capable  that product is good  the tech is good  but you have to put all those pieces together and get out there and fight against these big whales every day dylan lewis  as always  people on the program may own stocks mentioned in the motley fool

                        "For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – May 28, 2024 – Zacks Value Trader is a podcast hosted weekly by Zacks Stock Strategist Tracey Ryniec. Every week, Tracey will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks, bonds and ETFs and how it impacts your life. To listen to the podcast, click here: https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2278948/long-term-stock-investors-when-do-you-sell)Long-Term Stock Investors: When Do You Sell?Welcome to Episode #370 of the Value Investor Podcast.(0:30) - How Do You Know When To Sell Your Long-term Investment?(5:30) - Tracey’s Top Stock Picks For Buy and Hold(28:00) - Episode Roundup: AAPL, SBUX, DIS, SQ, TSLAPodcast@Zacks.comEvery week, Tracey Ryniec, the editor of Zacks Value Investor portfolio, shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks.How long have you held some of your stocks?5-years? 10-years? Or even 20-years?Warren Buffett has famously said the time to sell a stock is never. But even the world's greatest value investor has sold stocks from the Berkshire portfolio, including the sale of IBM which was for a loss.When Do You Sell? There's no manual that tells you when to sell. When he sold IBM, Buffett said the business wasn't performing as he had hoped when he bought it. Recently, Berkshire Hathaway sold a $20 billion chunk of its Apple position. It has owned Apple for 8 years. Buffett claimed the sale was for tax purposes.Basically, investors should ask whether the company's business is similar to what it was when they bought it. Is the management still excellent? Is there still growth and new products? Is the company in an industry that faces risks that will be difficult to overcome? Does it have a moat?It's Not All or NothingThat's another thing all long-term investors should know. You don't have to sell your entire position. Another option is to sell just a portion of your position and let the rest of it ride in your portfolio. That's what Buffett did with Apple.5 Popular Buy and Hold Stocks1. Apple Inc. AAPLApple is one of the most popular stocks among value investors thanks to Warren Buffett gushing about it nearly every year since 2016. But his recent sale of Apple probably did cause some long-term investors to question their own strategy.Apple is expected to grow its earnings by 7.2% in fiscal 2024 and another 9.6% in fiscal 2025. Shares of Apple are up just 9.6% over the last year and are underperforming the S&P 500, which was up 25.7% during the same period.Trading at 29x, Apple is no longer a value stock. Should long-term investors think about taking some profit off on Apple like Buffett did?Story continues2. Starbucks Corp. SBUXStarbucks recently had a disappointing quarter. Earnings are only expected to be up 1.4% in fiscal 2024.Shares of Starbucks have fallen 21.6% over the last year but Starbucks isn't cheap. It still trades with a forward P/E of 22.5.Tracey has owned Starbucks in her personal portfolio for 10 years. Is it time to cut Starbucks loose?3. The Walt Disney Co. DISMany parents have bought shares of Walt Disney over the years for their children's stock portfolio. After all, why not buy what you know?It's been a rough 5 years for Walt Disney. Shares are down 24.2% during that time while the S&P 500 is up 86.4%. Earnings of Walt Disney are rebounding, however. They are expected to be up 26.6% in fiscal 2024 and another 14.3% in fiscal 2025.Should Walt Disney still be in a parent's portfolio?4. Shopify Inc. SHOPShopify was a big pandemic winner, hitting new highs in late 2021. But since, it has sold off. However, Shopify is still up 154% over the last 5 years, which is beating the S&P 500 which is up 86.4%.Shares of Shopify are struggling in 2024, as they have fallen 26% year-to-date. Yet, earnings are on the rebound. Earnings are expected to rise 29.7% in 2024 and another 33.8% in 2025.Should long-term investors have patience with Shopify?5. Tesla, Inc. TSLATesla has hit a rough patch in 2024. Shares of Tesla have fallen 30% year-to-date. But long-term investors might barely have noticed as the stock is still up 1570% over the last 5 years.Tesla's earnings are expected to fall this year, by 20.8%. But analysts expect a rebound in 2025, with earnings forecast to rise 31%.Tesla investors have been known to be patient. Should they continue to be in 2024?What Else Should You Know About Selling a Long-Term Stock Position?

I will now turn the call over to Amir, Co-Founder and CEO.Story continuesAmir SchlachetThank you, Erica, and welcome, everyone. For the financial results of Q1, which we are releasing today, we are off to a great start of what we believe will be yet another pivotal year of growth for Global-E. GMV, revenues and adjusted EBITDA all beat the top of our forecasted range for the quarter. With GMV growing 32% year-on-year, revenues growing 24% and adjusted EBITDA growing 47%. These strong results manifest our team's continued execution across all elements of the business, coupled with our effectiveness in controlling costs and the fact that macro conditions during the quarter were slightly more favorable than what we initially anticipated back in February. Moreover, we remain confident in our ability to uphold our plans for the remainder of the year as is reflected in our updated guidance for the full year of 2024. Most notably, the large client launches planned for the second half of the year are on track and Shopify market's growth continues to amass merchants at the planned pace. Among other things, we believe both these factors will contribute to our ability to accelerate growth in the second half of the year. Later in this call, also will review our Q1 results in more detail and will provide you with our guidance for Q2 and our raised guidance for the full year of 2024. But before we do that, I would like to share with you some of the exciting business developments we have seen recently. During Q1, we continued to experience strong demand for our services across all markets we operate in. Q1, so many renowned brands go live with Global-E services. In the US, designer brands, Donna Karan and DKNY, footwear brand hated by Crocs and sport fashion brand golf length all went live , as did Imperial workshop, our first US merchant on the Wix platform. Thanks to the combination of Wix and Global-E, all aspiring Jedi Knights can now do their essential lifesaver shopping online on the Imperial virtual website regardless of where they live. Of course, as long as they it's not in a galaxy far, far away. During the quarter, we also launched with lingerie brand, La Senza in Canada as well as high street fashion brands, hubs and TM Lewin, luggage brand antler and homeware brand Soho home in the UK. In Europe, we launched with the French minted style fashion brand, Louise MiSha with fashion brands Gérard Darel, Soeur and Caroll, and we're doing now and luxury lifestyle brand Repetto, which thanks to Global-E can now sell it iconic Ballerina shoes worldwide as seamlessly and effectively as it does so in France. The quarter also saw the launch of innovative fashion brand marketing and the online store of workwear and protective gear retailer Engelbert Strauss both in Germany. Moreover, we launch with the leisure brand Pacha in Spain with its famous Jerry's logo, women's luxury fashion brand Costarellos in Greece and the fashion brand Rubato in Sweden among many others. Our business in APAC continued to expand all the time as well. With examples of recent launches in the region being Infamous Swim and Carla Zampatti in Australia, Hi mu-mo by Avex and commmonsmart in Japan, DIY Watch Club in Hong Kong and more. During Q1, we also continued our efforts to expand our business with existing merchants and with brand groups. As such, we opened new markets for Adidas and Doen and went live with Infiniment, an additional brand from the COTY group. We also went live with Tap To Style, a new brand by Modes in Italy, who themselves just went live the previous quarter. And we've NNormal, a new Spanish brand from the Camper group. With dozens of other brands going live and we've robust integration and sales pipelines, we believe we can continue on our growth path into the future as more and more merchants put emphasis on global direct-to-consumer sales. Switching gears, I would like to update you regarding the various components of our strategic partnership with Shopify. On the 3P or direct integration side, the migration of our historical merchant base onto the new native integration is nearing completion and the team's focus has turned now towards the continued gradual transition of all Shopify merchants onto checkout extensibility. On the 1P or Shopify markets Pro side, merchants continue to sign up and go live, gradually amassing GMV at the planned rate. In parallel, the teams on both sides continue to work on developing additional features and capabilities, further enhancing the solutions reach. Given the large market potential on the Shopify platform and as adoption of the innovative market's Pro solution continues to rise, we remain highly convinced in our ability to capture a meaningful part of this massive market opportunity over the course over the next few years. We've already had exciting developments and with many others across the entire business, we continue to believe more than ever in our ability to exhibit long-term and durable growth as we capture more and more of the vast greenfield opportunity that lies ahead of us. I will now hand it to Ofer, our CFO to take us through the quarterly numbers in more depth as well as present our updated guidance going forward.Ofer KorenThank you, Amir, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today for our earnings call. We are off to a strong start in 2024. Q1 with another quarter of fast growth and robust adjusted EBITDA as we continue to drive progress on all fronts and remain committed to delivering value to merchants in their international initiatives. I'd like to point out again that in addition to our GAAP results, I'll also be discussing certain non-GAAP results. Our GAAP financial results, along with the reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results can be found in our earnings release. As I mentioned, we have experienced rapid growth of GMV in Q1 as we generated $930 million of GMV, an increase of 32% year-over-year. 3.9% over the midpoint of our guidance for Q1. We continued to benefit from the growth of Global e-commerce, which is back to its pre-COVID long-term pattern, taking share from brick and mortar retailers and the continued focus of merchants of direct to consumer, where there is still uncertainty regarding consumer demand, which remains volatile. In Q1, we generated total revenue of $145.9 million up 24% year-over-year. Service fee revenue were $68.3 million, up 36%, and fulfillment services revenue were up 15% to $77.6 million. The higher growth of service fee revenue compared to fulfillment services revenue was mainly driven by the higher share of our multi-local offering. As reflected in our guidance, we expect take rates to stabilize at close to 16%, driven by elevated levels of fulfillment services adoption. Non-GAAP gross profit continued to outpace revenue growth. In Q1, non-GAAP gross profit was $66.1 million, up 36% year-over-year, representing a gross margin of 45.3% compared to 41.4% in the same period last year, driven by the higher share of service revenue and our continuous efficiency efforts. GAAP gross profit was $63.3 million, representing a margin of 43.4%. Moving on to operational expenses, we continued to invest in the development of our platform to further enhance and expand our offering. R&D expense in Q4, excluding stock-based compensation, was $20.1 million or 13.8% of revenue compared to $16.9 million or 14.3% in the same period last year. Total R&D spend in Q4 was $23.5 million. We also continue to invest in sales and marketing to expand our pipeline while maintaining efficiencies. Sales and marketing expense excluding Shopify related amortization expenses, stock-based compensation acquisition related intangibles amortization was $17.2 million or 11.8% of revenue compared to $10.5 million or 8.9% of revenue in the same period last year. Shopify warrant related amortization expense was $36.3 million. Total sales and marketing expenses for the quarter were $57 million. General and administrative expenses, excluding stock-based compensation, acquisition related expenses and acquisition related contingent consideration was $8.3 million or 5.7% of revenue compared to $7.4 million or 6.3% of revenue in the same period last year. Total G&A spend in Q1 was $12.1 million. Adjusted EBITDA continued to grow rapidly and totaled $21.3 million, representing a 14.6% adjusted EBITDA margin and increasing by 47% from $14.5 million or 12.3% margin in the same period last year. Net loss was $32.1 million compared to a net loss of $43.1 million in the year ago period, driven mainly by the amortization expenses related to the Shopify warrants and by the transaction related intangibles. Switching gears and turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statements, we ended the quarter with $298 million in cash, cash equivalents, including short-term deposits and marketable securities. Cash flow used by operating activities was $54.3 million compared to $29.5 million used a year ago, driven by typical first quarter post peak working capital dynamics and a $12.2 million payment of held back acquisition related proceeds to the flow founders. Moving on to our financial outlook and guidance for Q2 and our updated 2024 full year guidance. For Q2 2024, we're expecting GMV to be in the range of $1.025 billion to $1.065 billion. At the midpoint of the range, this represents a growth rate of 27% versus Q2 of 2023. We expect Q2 revenue to be in the range of $162.5 million to $168.5 million. At the midpoint of the range, this represents a growth rate of 24% versus Q2 of 2023. For adjusted EBITDA, we're expecting profit in the range of $24.5 million to $28.5 million. For the full year of 2024, we are raising our guidance and now anticipate GMV to be in the range of $4.625 billion to $4.865 billion, representing a [33.4%] annual growth rate at the midpoint of the range. Revenue is now expected to be in the range of $733 million to $773 million, representing a growth rate of 32.1% at the midpoint of the range. For adjusted EBITDA, we are now expecting a profit of $124 million to 140 million. We continue to believe growth will accelerate in the second half of the year, driven by large merchant launches planned for H2, which are on track. Anticipated elevate volume contribution from Shopify market Pro, which is growing as expected and the lower impact from border free on a year-on-year comparison. In conclusion, the opportunity in front of us remains massive, and we continue our journey to support merchants worldwide in expanding their direct to consumer business. We focus on execution and believe we can continue to grow rapidly while further expanding cash generation in the coming years. And with that, Amir and I are happy to answer questions you may have. Operator?Question and Answer SessionOperatorThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question and answer session. (Operator Instructions) Will Nance, Goldman Sachs.Will NanceHey, guys. Good morning. I appreciate taking the question. I know you had a comment in the prepared remarks that the macro environment ended up being a little bit better than the expectations in the first quarter. And I'm just wondering if you could kind of speak to what you're seeing so far in 2Q, just given some of the negative data points around luxury spending. And is there anything have you guys noticed any change in spending patterns over the last month and a half?Amir SchlachetHey, Will, thanks for the question. Basically we haven't seen any material changes in Q2 so far. Things continue to be volatile in terms of macro conditions, we see it basically in the trading patterns. But our anticipation and what we've seen so far in Q2 and our assumptions for the remainder of Q2 is that the volatility enhanced the macro environment in general will remain similar to what we've seen in Q1.Will NanceIt's super helpful. And then can you just talk about the pipeline of product enhancements on the market pro side, things like fulfillment and just what the rollout schedule for things like that would be?Nir DebbiHey, Will, it's Nir. We continue to work according to our roadmap, developing, enhancements and features towards a Shopify market's pro. And we continue to hold those out. I think over the next few quarters, we will see a gradual rollout of all the key elements we are working toward, and we expect that to continue and accelerate the growth in the coming quarters of the solutions adoption.Will NanceGot it. I appreciate taking the questions.OperatorSamad Samana, Jefferies.Samad SamanaHi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So maybe first, you guys mentioned multiple times that markets pro that the merchant ramp is tracking to plan. Can you just remind us of what the planned target is, whether that's in terms of number of merchants or GMV that you're targeting for 2024 and what have you assumed in guidance for the rest of the year?Nir DebbiI Samad. We haven't guided for specific numbers of what we expect this year on market pro. In the future as we indicated before, once it becomes a large enough this time, we will look at the more clarity specifically on market pro. However, the market expectations as reflected between different markets report is in line with what we see today. So we are trading within the numbers that are outside in the market.Samad SamanaUnderstood. And then maybe just affairs, I think about the you mentioned, we've turned the corner, but I didn't catch NRR. Could you maybe help us understand how NRR track through the quarter and what you've observed maybe first quarter and if that's tracking to kind of historical assumptions that you've seen over the last few years?Ofer KorenSo, hey Samada, thanks for the question. So as you know, we provide the annual and the NRR numbers. However, generally speaking, we can say that while as Amir mentioned, there is volatility in consumer behavior, all in all, except for the lower two weeks in February, it has been around or just slightly below the numbers we usually feel that the numbers we've expected for this year. So it's not at its peak and it's -- it is below average, but it's more or less in line with what we've expected for 2024.Samad SamanaGreat. Thanks again, and congrats on strong quarter.Ofer KorenThank you a lot.OperatorBrian Peterson, Raymond James.Brian PetersonThanks all and congrats on the quarter. So I know you mentioned some commentary on the macro. I'm curious how that relates to the top of the funnel. What are you seeing in terms of pipeline creation in deal timing thus far in 2024.Nir DebbiHey, hi, it's Nir. Thank you for the question. For now, what we see as here today is that our pipelines remained strong or even stronger than what we've seen ever in the past. We are looking toward the second part of the year where we expect the launch of several large merchants that are currently in project state as well as the signing of at least additional one. So we're quite optimistic. I don't think that we ever had the pipeline in terms of sheer dollars that is as strong as this one.Brian PetersonThat's great to hear and maybe just to follow up on, you had a nice beat in gross margins this quarter. I know the mix is maybe a little bit different, but want to understand what drove that and how we should be thinking about modeling gross margins going forward. Thanks, guys.Ofer KorenThat -- so yeah, gross margins have been high this quarter, and that is due to two factors. The first one is actually the mix of revenues. So service fees share was higher compared to last year to the parallel quarter. And in addition, we are continuously working on efficiencies, improving processes and so on so forth. So this contributed as well. Going forward, we don't expect as we previously stated, we don't expect any significant expansion this year. We are happy with the level of gross margins we currently have. So going forward, we do not expect a significant increase.OperatorKoji Ikeda, Bank of America.Koji IkedaYeah, hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking the questions. I wanted to ask on the guidance here, just thinking about the GMV guide specifically. And when I look at the second quarter guide and the full quarter guide and a little bit of the historica,l a seasonal pattern in GMV, it looks like a pretty heavy ramp into the fourth quarter here. So just trying to understand, or maybe a bit more qualitative color in the way you're thinking about linearity in GMV ramp for the rest of the year? Thank you.Ofer KorenSo you're right, this year is not our typical year, and we've discussed that in the previous quarter as well. H2 growth takes into account the few drivers. The first one is the large client launches that we expect and currently are on track, on time. So this is one main contributor. In previous years, we had large client launches, but they were not all in the second half of the year. The second driver is obviously Shopify markets roll, which is ramping up, but we expect it to contribute more in H2. And it is currently, as we mentioned it on target. So we feel quite confident with the way it's progressing. The third one is we do expect to see reduced effect of Borderfree work -- Borderfree is weighing on our growth a bit due to the nature of the merchants trading on Borderfree, a lot of large department stores and so on. And as we go forward, one, its share of our volume is decreasing because the other businesses is growing and we are migrating those merchants to globally, and we expect to see uplifts once those migrations are done. So those are the main drivers behind the H2 growth.Koji IkedaGot it. Thank you. Just a follow-up here on the large merchants that you've mentioned that you're expecting to come on in the second half. It definitely sounds like it's a positive and on the progression here to get them to go live. But it also sounds like it's a pretty big risk guidance if they don't go live, so maybe you could speak to what is giving you that confidence that these guys will be able to get the globally platform live later this year? Thanks guys.Nir DebbiHi, Koji. It's Nir. The large projects are currently on track. It's projects that are already deep into the project phase of it in order to launch in Q3 and early Q4 because no one launches in November, December. Usually everybody is doing it for peak. So in the next four months in order to launch large merchants are already deep into the integration and the testing cycle. So we do have high confidence that it is happening. While there is always a risk of delay, we do have a high level of confidence based on the current status of the project, and it's actually going to go as planned. So as we do take some, I would say some level of conservatism into our guidance, of course, we do have -- we did factor out certain delays a few weeks here a few weeks there in order to absorb the minor changes in the launches.Koji IkedaThank you. Thank you for taking the call.Nir DebbiThanks, good.OperatorScott Berg, Needham.Scott BergHi, everyone, it's Berg. Thanks for taking my questions. Nir, I think it was you that responded to the pipeline question in second half and pleased that actually I think it was dollar wise might be an all-time high here. As you look back at your Q1 business, how or what your sales cycles look like? Are you able at continue to close deals at similar rates? Or is there anything in the macro that might be accelerating or delaying some of those sales cycles?Nir DebbiYeah. So to be honest, I think after I would a slight delay sometime in mid-half last year, as of -- I would say, late last year, this Q1 we are more optimistic that merchants are -- I would say, starting to see a light at the end of the tunnel and we see a willing to make commitments faster, is the main change we see is on the larger project side where we see more RFPs coming in, a more interest from large merchants than if that continues. We do expect it to affect very positively our 2025 launches. So it's pipeline that is being built now, very strong one, and we believe that if this continues along the year as we will see a very positive effect on our 2025 business.Scott BergGot it. That's very helpful. Thank you. And then as you all look at six months into the market's pro opportunity with Shopify, you seem pleased with current traction at least year to date and what the second half looks like. But are there additional levers that you believe that you can pull, maybe that on impact this year, maybe it's more impacting next year in fiscal '25, but are there additional levers that you can pull to maybe it accelerates some of the merchant adoption of that platform?Amir SchlachetYeah. Thanks, Scott, it's Amir. So as you said, and as we noted, we're indeed pleased with the pace in which our merchants are onboarding and the GMV is amassing. And yes, there is a joint pipeline and roadmap between us and Shopify, which is aimed at constantly adding more features and enhancing the solution, which by itself should enlarge the applicability of the solution for additional merchants and accelerate down the line into as indicated into next year and beyond, the pace in which it is adopted. In addition, as a reminder, this market's pro currently available just for US based merchants, again, as part of our roadmap into the future, we do also plan together with Shopify down the line to open the markets for offering for merchants from additional markets like the UK and others that's still there's no date yet set. It's still in the future. But when that goes online, it will further accelerate the adoption rate.Scott BergUnderstood. Very helpful. Thanks and congrats again on good quarter.Amir SchlachetWelcome.OperatorJames Faucette, Morgan Stanley.James FaucetteGreat. Thank you. I wanted to ask just a couple of follow-up questions. First, in terms of your existing customers, I know you said that the NRR was kind of moving around and wasn't quite as strong as it has been historically. But can you give us a little color on how the same-store sales component of that is tracking in if you've made any adjustments to how that's being incorporated into your outlook for this year?Ofer KorenSure. Thank you for that, James. It's offer. So I was referring previously mainly to that component that the same-store sales has been lower than the historical average and it has been volatile. However, we see it sort of stabilizing around the levels that we've assumed or used for our budget. So there was a drop in mid-February that we talked about in the previous quarter, then it came back. And since then it is sort of hovering around the same levels with some volatility.James FaucetteGreat. Appreciate that. And then one back on Shopify, Shopify markets pro and it sounds like that that's continuing to track well, if you can give us a little more insight into how that develops sequentially and then and clearly, you're doing a lot to add incremental functionality is -- I guess the comment that that'll increase the applicability, is that built into the acceleration you're expecting in the latter part of this year? Or should we think about there being more of a lag and there being more of an impact in trajectory in '25? Thanks.Amir SchlachetYeah. Thanks, James. So in terms of the adoption rate, we see a constant stream of merchants that is joining and it's where constantly working, not just on features that have to do with the offering itself, but also the onboarding process, which is not less important and making it even more seamless and even faster for merchants to onboard and start trading. So this together with the larger appeal as we roll down, roll out, more features should gradually enhance that kind of daily or weekly pace of merchants joining the platform. So we do bake into our assumptions going forward, the kind of gradual increase in that base when we look on a longer term, but also take into account that these are all new merchants. So as the year progresses, we should get increasingly meaningful because we get more and more of these merchants to trade in parallel on the platform.OperatorBrent Bracelin, Piper Sandler.Brent BracelinI thank you. So it sounds like the large merchants here are helping drive the second half acceleration. It sounds like you're getting more interest from large merchants in the pipeline. I just wanted to double-click into why now? Could you talk about why these large merchants are now turning to Global-E, the tough macro out there. There's certainly challenges. So love to better explain kind of why you're seeing the large buckets it over to Global-E now. Thanks.Nir DebbiHi, Brent. It's Nir. Then overall, we have seen a movement toward larger merchants that started in COVID. COVID pushed much more larger retailers towards accelerating the direct to consumer approach, especially on a global level as most of them had it in the home market. And we do see this being accelerated now with more RFPs coming out as domestic markets I assume are more challenging or more saturated for many of them. And they do want to have a further growth and further profitability that can be provided by a direct to consumer and not to wholesale or middlemen in different countries around the world. So we do expect it to continue to grow. And I think it also relates to globally positioning that overtime build much more expertise and brand position as market leader in supporting those large brands, generating great results and making the operations much more seamless and simple, trading around the world. And we continue to see this growing and accelerating over time as we able to build more capabilities, as being much more localized in more markets around the world and gain and generate more data out of this growth. Of the combination of it all, I think creates this flywheel effect that would continue to attract a larger business into the company as we see it.Brent Bracelin[Applause]. Thanks for that. And then I know for your -- if I think about the GMV growth guide at the midpoint versus the revenue guide at the midpoint. Can you just talk a little bit about take rate and expectations on take rate. What's driving improvement here in Q2?Ofer KorenSo basically, as we mentioned previously, we expect -- while we do expect some volatility in take rates, depending on specific GMV mix. We expect it to be much more stable if you look at the entire year compared to previous years. So we expect it to be close to 16% over the year with less volatility between quarters. As we've mentioned, we do see multi-local growth normalizing not because they're those merchants are not growing, they're growing very nicely. But last year, they either that the larger of those either expanded their business with us or launched the business with us. So it was a unique year in that perspective. So we see more normalized take rate. There aren't many changes, it's mainly so the margin movement depending on the GMV mix, but we do expect it to stabilize below 16%.Brent BracelinMakes sense. Thank you so much.Ofer KorenThanks, Brent.OperatorAndrew Basch, Wells Fargo.Andrew BaschHey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to get a product update on the demand then solution that you're planning to launch in the second half and maybe an update on early receptiveness you heard from clients and whether that can meaningfully move the needle on revenues or margins as we get in the back half of the year?Nir DebbiHi, thank you for the question, it's Nir. We continue to invest in building out the margin capabilities. We did over the last few quarters, build expertise and an in-house specialized agency to support our brands in growing the demand generation. In the second part of the year, we are going to launch to support it based on the Borderfree acquisition, a unique proposition, that would support us in driving our brands's growth. We are now in the early stages of introducing this solution to our merchants. We it's -- not it's not like for them yet. It's just being introduced to them now in order to get the buy-in in order to get them live on it in the second part of the year. We do see a very great interest in it and we do expect high adoption. We do believe it will accelerate the growth and we will start seeing positive effect as of the last quarter of the year, but much more when we're looking to add 2025 onwards, it does go into as we see it accelerate our growth. And our clients' growth based on actually increasing NDL. We expect that the trading merchants today and merchants that will launch with us in the future would be able to penetrate new markets and increase the footfall in current markets with the services. So we do have high hopes to it, most of it will not materialize. Of course, in 2024, we do see it as a contribution that's going to grow as of 2025 onwards.Andrew BaschDefinitely something to look forward to. Touching on adjusted EBITDA, another nice quarter of stability there. Just thinking about the back half ramp with markets grow and with the two large merchants, how do you feel from an investment perspective that you're positioned today? And how do you think that can translate to margins as we get in the back half of this year and then into 2025? Just trying to better understand the modeling here.Ofer KorenSo EBITDA, as reflected in our guidance, we expect the margin to grow -- to continue to grow in 2024 and to be around 18%. The economics of new merchants coming in or the Shopify markets, the flow offering, obviously, those are large merchants, the economics are a bit different, but on the same level, we launched many smaller merchants in the first half of the year. So there is a balance there. We don't expect any significant changes. We expect to see an improvement over time as reflected in our guidance for the entire year as well.Amir SchlachetAnd it's Amir. I'll just add maybe that we do or we've spoken a couple of times in the past and also in this call, we strongly believe that there is a huge greenfield opportunity still ahead of us. So we do, it's important to note that we do still prioritize growth over profitability. So whenever we see and we continue to see you all the time opportunities to reinvest in the business, of course, always watching our operations, expenses growth and making sure that we continue to gradually improve on margins. But still we continue to invest in adding more resources on both on the R&D side and across the rest of the business to make sure that we are continue to be well positioned to capture this opportunity.OperatorPat Walravens, JMP.Pat WalravensOh, great. Thank you. So Amir, big picture, you have all these growth drivers, you've got Shopify, you can go more in the US, they go internationally, just launched with mix. You're adding more and bigger brands. You have the demand gen solution coming out. So the question is what are the constraints on the ability of this company to scale? You're going to do $1 billion next year? Why can't it grow to $10 billion?Amir SchlachetI don't think we can't. I think we can. Pat, I think it's the opportunity is there, I think our product market fit is there. I think we have in the pipeline, also additional complementary services that we can add. So all of that together, I think we're on the right path to continue growing. We are also constantly working on enlarging our already significant ecosystem of great partners around us where they can contribute to our growth and we can contribute to their growth. So I think the main constraints are time. And of course, as always, execution, and we continue to focus on execution. We continue to make sure that we do the best job possible for the growth of our merchants and we believe that as we continue to do so, growth will continue to come and we can continue to materialize that opportunity ahead of us.Pat WalravensAwesome. Right. And I'm looking forward to seeing you guys on Wednesday until then congratulations.Amir SchlachetSame here. Thanks, Pat.OperatorMaddie Schrage, KeyBanc Capital Markets.Maddie SchrageHey, guys, and thank you for taking my question. I was just wondering if you can give an update on the Borderfree migration. Just kind of wondering maybe what percentage of customers have moved over to the Global-E platform and kind of any early learnings on that uplift that you could potentially see there? Thanks.Amir SchlachetSo we do continue to work with the clients toward migration to end -- by the end of this year or latest if we'll see as there is a need for it early Q1 next year. The clients that have migrated, we have seen great results in uplifting the sales conversion rates, driving better performance, better sales based on the -- I would say, a larger suite of solutions and services on our platform. We do expect that once the vast majority of Borderfree clients would migrate, we will see a better trading with them in the following quarter -- in the following quarters. So we are optimistic about it. It is as we indicated in the past, going slower than initially expected. So we do believe that some of it will roll out into Q1 of next year. However, we are happy with the results that we have seen on migrated clients.Maddie SchrageGreat. And then just a quick follow up. Do you have any call-outs from maybe a geo perspective? are there any standouts in terms of inbound markets, either headwinds or tailwinds? Thanks.Amir SchlachetI think that we constantly see different changes in different markets around the world in terms of inbound volumes as some countries face a more challenging macro. You see there a growth, a declining. Some of the markets are affected by geopolitics, if you look at the inbound into Israel and Ukraine, where you see the market is actually shrinking in two digit percentage base heavily. But because of our global nature and amount of corridors we sell into as an actuary, I think that all in all, as Ofer indicated, and we do see some stability. So it's overall numbers are slightly below historical averages, but in line with what we expected for this year, which was, I would say, a bit softer macro in general than previous years, despite the fact that, yes, there is volatility. Some weeks looks better or less. But overall, I think what we do see now is stable, a relatively okay macro, not as great as previous years. But I would say an okay, macro in general reflected in same-store sales across different corridors.OperatorMark Zgutowicz, The Benchmark Company.Mark ZgutowiczThank you. Hi, guys. Just a question around the onboarding process for markets pro merchants. I know there's been some progress made there and just curious in terms of lifting the friction there. Are those capabilities now in place? Are there still more enhancements that may accelerate the onboarding of US merchants? And then is this the key variable in terms of moving markets pro outside the US with Shopify? Thanks.Nir DebbiYeah, and thank you for the question, it's Nir. We do continue to roll out features and the process alignments in order to make the onboarding quicker, more seamless and to gain a great but even better results out of the gate. However, also on the ongoing trading and is a market segments and vertical that the solution is geared for. We do have still a rollout plan of different feature and capabilities, that will be rolled out to the coming quarters. On the back of this completion, of course, we would go into a much wider rollout, but this is dependent, of course, on Shopify and our decisions. But we are fully aligned on the roadmap ahead and what we need to achieve in the coming quarters in order to continue with the rollout.Mark ZgutowiczThanks, Nir, That's helpful. And then one quick one for over possibly on luxury. Just curious how that segment is pacing first half versus it was just year-over-year first up year-over-year? Thanks.Ofer KorenYeah. So regarding luxury, 2023 was not a good year for luxury as we discussed several times. And since then, we've seen it sort of [double] and coming back to growth, not very strong growth. But after the lows that we have seen during some of the quarters, mainly, I think it was in Q3 last year, it has stabilized and gone back to growth, maybe not growing as fast as other segments, but positive growth.OperatorMatt Coad, Kelly, Autonomous Research.Matt CoadHey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I'm curious if you could unpack the growth in sales and marketing expenses ex the one amortization, sorry about that? It's growing at a really fast pace, as you noted in your prepared remarks. Just curious, a lot of this growth coming mainly from Shopify's revenue share or are there changes to your go-to-market approach that we should be aware of? Thanks.Ofer KorenSure. So as you mentioned, we do have sort of a variable cost in our sales and marketing, which is the Shopify rev share component and it is growing. So I think most of the growth in expenses or the -- not most of the growth, but most of the extra growth is due to Shopify rev share expenses. However, nothing special to report, but we are continuously expanding our sales force. It's a gradual expansion. But as we grow, we are bringing in more people, but not anything out of the ordinary.OperatorMatt O'Neill, FT partners.Matt O'NeillHey, gentlemen, thanks so much for receiving me in at the end. A lot of good questions asked and answered. Maybe first, Ofer, I know you mentioned a couple of points contributing to the gross take rate that'll stabilize close to [16] you mentioned. This quarter, the net take rate actually outperformed by a good amount and I was just curious if there's any call-outs to attribute that to anything that we should expect to be stickier going forward or if it was maybe more of a mix shift? And then I'll just get my follow-up in there now. And a bunch of people asked about Shopify markets pro and specifically the international rollout. That's one thing just from a time line perspective to be conservative, we should think about international markets there as it 2025 and beyond type of a discussion. Thanks a lot.Nir DebbiIn terms of the international rollout, I think it's also dependent on Shopify plans. So we can't commit or comment about it without being aligned with Shopify. But I do expect that if we in the coming quarters, we will meet our target. We will see additional market being rolled in when I think it's much more decision for Shopify to make.Matt O'NeillUnderstood. And on the net take rate this quarter, anything to think about going forward or maybe some unique mix elements that were idiosyncratic.Ofer KorenSo as we previously stated, some of it is due to GMV mix. However, we do see a clear line of improvement over time. Due to one efficiencies, so, different processes we brought in, we have a team, very senior team that is going through the organization and mapping it for AI initiatives. I think that we've mentioned in the previous call that we had some very nice processes that are implemented, that are already contributing mainly around our service but also in other areas. So this is just an example. Another example is classification, duty classifications, and we do have quite a few initiatives, but it's not just the [iron] initiative, but also other processes and also economies of scale that we're pushing. So over time, we do expect to see an improvement. However, as I mentioned this, the gross margin we had this quarter was high and some of it was due to this specific revenue and GMV mix.OperatorThank you. There are no further questions at this time. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Amir Schlachet for final closing comments.Amir SchlachetThank you very much, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. And we very much look forward to seeing you again on our future earnings calls. Just before we adjourn, I would like to take this opportunity again to say a big thank you to all of our wonderful team members throughout the world. Your hard work and complete dedication to the success of our merchants are and will always be the key driving force behind our continued growth and success. So goodbye to all and take care.OperatorThank you. So ladies and gentlemen, this concludes your conference call for today. We thank you for participating and ask that you please disconnect your lines.",

growing 24  and adjusted ebitda growing 47   these strong results manifest our team s continued execution across all elements of the business  coupled with our effectiveness in controlling costs and the fact that macro conditions during the quarter were slightly more favorable than what we initially anticipated back in february  moreover  we remain confident in our ability to uphold our plans for the remainder of the year as is reflected in our updated guidance for the full year of 2024  most notably  the large client launches planned for the second half of the year are on track and shopify market s growth continues to amass merchants at the planned pace  among other things  we believe both these factors will contribute to our ability to accelerate growth in the second half of the year  later in this call  also will review our q1 results in more detail and will provide you with our guidance for q2 and our raised guidance for the full year of 2024  but before we do that  i would like

point out again that in addition to our gaap results  i ll also be discussing certain non gaap results  our gaap financial results  along with the reconciliation between gaap and non gaap results can be found in our earnings release  as i mentioned  we have experienced rapid growth of gmv in q1 as we generated  930 million of gmv  an increase of 32  year over year  3 9  over the midpoint of our guidance for q1  we continued to benefit from the growth of global e commerce  which is back to its pre covid long term pattern  taking share from brick and mortar retailers and the continued focus of merchants of direct to consumer  where there is still uncertainty regarding consumer demand  which remains volatile  in q1  we generated total revenue of  145 9 million up 24  year over year  service fee revenue were  68 3 million  up 36   and fulfillment services revenue were up 15  to  77 6 million  the higher growth of service fee revenue compared to fulfillment services revenue was mainly driven by the higher share of our multi local offering  as reflected in our guidance  we expect take rates to stabilize at close to 16   driven by elevated levels of fulfillment services adoption  non gaap gross profit continued to outpace revenue growth  in q1  non gaap gross profit was  66 1 million  up 36  year over year  representing a gross margin of 45 3  compared to 41 4  in the same period last year  driven by the higher share of service revenue and our continuous efficiency efforts  gaap gross profit was  63 3 million  representing a margin of 43 4   moving on to operational expenses  we continued to invest in the development of our platform to further enhance and expand our offering  r d expense in q4  excluding stock based compensation  was  20 1 million or 13 8  of revenue compared to  16 9 million or 14 3  in the same period last year  total r d spend in q4 was  23 5 million  we also continue to invest in sales and marketing to expand our pipeline while maintaining efficiencies  sales and marketing expense excluding shopify related amortization expenses  stock based compensation acquisition related intangibles amortization was  17 2 million or 11 8  of revenue compared to  10 5 million or 8 9  of revenue in the same period last year  shopify warrant related amortization expense was  36 3 million  total sales and marketing expenses for the quarter were  57 million  general and administrative expenses  excluding stock based compensation  acquisition related expenses and acquisition related contingent consideration was  8 3 million or 5 7  of revenue compared to  7 4 million or 6 3  of revenue in the same period last year  total g a spend in q1 was  12 1 million  adjusted ebitda continued to grow rapidly and totaled  21 3 million  representing a 14 6  adjusted ebitda margin and increasing by 47  from  14 5 million or 12 3  margin in the same period last year  net loss was  32 1 million compared to a net loss of  43 1 million in the year ago period  driven mainly by the amortization expenses related to the shopify warrants and by the transaction related intangibles  switching gears and turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statements  we ended the quarter with  298 million in cash  cash equivalents  including short term deposits and marketable securities  cash flow used by operating activities was  54 3 million compared to  29 5 million used a year ago  driven by typical first quarter post peak working capital dynamics and a  12 2 million payment of held back acquisition related proceeds to the flow founders  moving on to our financial outlook and guidance for q2 and our updated 2024 full year guidance  for q2 2024  we re expecting gmv to be in the range of  1 025 billion to  1 065 billion  at the midpoint of the range  this represents a growth rate of 27  versus q2 of 2023  we expect q2 revenue to be in the range of  162 5 million to  168 5 million  at the midpoint of the range  this represents a growth rate of 24  versus q2 of 2023  for adjusted ebitda  we re expecting profit in the range of  24 5 million to  28 5 million  for the full year of 2024  we are raising our guidance and now anticipate gmv to be in the range of  4 625 billion to  4 865 billion  representing a  33 4   annual growth rate at the midpoint of the range  revenue is now expected to be in the range of  733 million to  773 million  representing a growth rate of 32 1  at the midpoint of the range  for adjusted ebitda  we are now expecting a profit of  124 million to 140 million  we continue to believe growth will accelerate in the second half of the year  driven by large merchant launches planned for h2  which are on track  anticipated elevate volume contribution from shopify market pro  which is growing as expected and the lower impact from border free on a year on year comparison  in conclusion  the opportunity in front of us remains massive  and we continue our journey to support merchants worldwide in expanding their direct to consumer business  we focus on execution and believe we can continue to grow rapidly while further expanding cash generation in the coming years  and with that  amir and i are happy to answer questions you may have  operator question and answer sessionoperatorthank you  ladies and gentlemen  we will now begin the question and answer session   operator instructions  will nance  goldman sachs will nancehey  guys  good morning  i appreciate taking the question  i know you had a comment in the prepared remarks that the macro environment ended up being a little bit better than the expectations in the first quarter  and i m just wondering if you could kind of speak to what you re seeing so far in 2q  just given some of the negative data points around luxury spending  and is there anything have you guys noticed any change in spending patterns over the last month and a half amir schlachethey  will  thanks for the question  basically we haven t seen any material changes in q2 so far  things continue to be volatile in terms of macro conditions  we see it basically in the trading patterns  but our anticipation and what we ve seen so far in q2 and our assumptions for the remainder of q2 is that the volatility enhanced the macro environment in general will remain similar to what we ve seen in q1 will nanceit s super helpful  and then can you just talk about the pipeline of product enhancements on the market pro side  things like fulfillment and just what the rollout schedule for things like that would be nir debbihey  will  it s nir  we continue to work according to our roadmap  developing  enhancements and features towards a shopify market s pro  and we continue to hold those out  i think over the next few quarters  we will see a gradual rollout of all the key elements we are working toward  and we expect that to continue and accelerate the growth in the coming quarters of the solutions adoption will nancegot it  i appreciate taking the questions operatorsamad samana  jefferies samad samanahi  good morning  thanks for taking my questions  so maybe first  you guys mentioned multiple times that markets pro that the merchant ramp is tracking to plan  can you just remind us of what the planned target is  whether that s in terms of number of merchants or gmv that you re targeting for 2024 and what have you assumed in guidance for the rest of the year nir debbii samad  we haven t guided for specific numbers of what we expect this year on market pro  in the future as we indicated before  once it becomes a large enough this time  we will look at the more clarity specifically on market pro  however  the market expectations as reflected between different markets report is in line with what we see today  so we are trading within the numbers that are outside in the market samad samanaunderstood  and then maybe just affairs  i think about the you mentioned  we ve turned the corner  but i didn t catch nrr  could you maybe help us understand how nrr track through the quarter and what you ve observed maybe first quarter and if that s tracking to kind of historical assumptions that you ve seen over the last few years ofer korenso  hey samada  thanks for the question  so as you know  we provide the annual and the nrr numbers  however  generally speaking  we can say that while as amir mentioned  there is volatility in consumer behavior  all in all  except for the lower two weeks in february  it has been around or just slightly below the numbers we usually feel that the numbers we ve expected for this year  so it s not at its peak and it s    it is below average  but it s more or less in line with what we ve expected for 2024 samad samanagreat  thanks again  and congrats on strong quarter ofer korenthank you a lot operatorbrian peterson  raymond james brian petersonthanks all and congrats on the quarter  so i know you mentioned some commentary on the macro  i m curious how that relates to the top of the funnel  what are you seeing in terms of pipeline creation in deal timing thus far in 2024 nir debbihey  hi  it s nir  thank you for the question  for now  what we see as here today is that our pipelines remained strong or even stronger than what we ve seen ever in the past  we are looking toward the second part of the year where we expect the launch of several large merchants that are currently in project state as well as the signing of at least additional one  so we re quite optimistic  i don t think that we ever had the pipeline in terms of sheer dollars that is as strong as this one brian petersonthat s great to hear and maybe just to follow up on  you had a nice beat in gross margins this quarter  i know the mix is maybe a little bit different  but want to understand what drove that and how we should be thinking about modeling gross margins going forward  thanks  guys ofer korenthat    so yeah  gross margins have been high this quarter  and that is due to two factors  the first one is actually the mix of revenues  so service fees share was higher compared to last year to the parallel quarter  and in addition  we are continuously working on efficiencies  improving processes and so on so forth  so this contributed as well  going forward  we don t expect as we previously stated  we don t expect any significant expansion this year  we are happy with the level of gross margins we currently have  so going forward  we do not expect a significant increase operatorkoji ikeda  bank of america koji ikedayeah  hey  guys  thanks so much for taking the questions  i wanted to ask on the guidance here  just thinking about the gmv guide specifically  and when i look at the second quarter guide and the full quarter guide and a little bit of the historica l a seasonal pattern in gmv  it looks like a pretty heavy ramp into the fourth quarter here  so just trying to understand  or maybe a bit more qualitative color in the way you re thinking about linearity in gmv ramp for the rest of the year  thank you ofer korenso you re right  this year is not our typical year  and we ve discussed that in the previous quarter as well  h2 growth takes into account the few drivers  the first one is the large client launches that we expect and currently are on track  on time  so this is one main contributor  in previous years  we had large client launches  but they were not all in the second half of the year  the second driver is obviously shopify markets roll  which is ramping up  but we expect it to contribute more in h2  and it is currently  as we mentioned it on target  so we feel quite confident with the way it s progressing  the third one is we do expect to see reduced effect of borderfree work    borderfree is weighing on our growth a bit due to the nature of the merchants trading on borderfree  a lot of large department stores and so on  and as we go forward  one  its share of our volume is decreasing because the other businesses is growing and we are migrating those merchants to globally  and we expect to see uplifts once those migrations are done  so those are the main drivers behind the h2 growth koji ikedagot it  thank you  just a follow up here on the large merchants that you ve mentioned that you re expecting to come on in the second half  it definitely sounds like it s a positive and on the progression here to get them to go live  but it also sounds like it s a pretty big risk guidance if they don t go live  so maybe you could speak to what is giving you that confidence that these guys will be able to get the globally platform live later this year  thanks guys nir debbihi  koji  it s nir  the large projects are currently on track  it s projects that are already deep into the project phase of it in order to launch in q3 and early q4 because no one launches in november  december  usually everybody is doing it for peak  so in the next four months in order to launch large merchants are already deep into the integration and the testing cycle  so we do have high confidence that it is happening  while there is always a risk of delay  we do have a high level of confidence based on the current status of the project  and it s actually going to go as planned  so as we do take some  i would say some level of conservatism into our guidance  of course  we do have    we did factor out certain delays a few weeks here a few weeks there in order to absorb the minor changes in the launches koji ikedathank you  thank you for taking the call nir debbithanks  good operatorscott berg  needham scott berghi  everyone  it s berg  thanks for taking my questions  nir  i think it was you that responded to the pipeline question in second half and pleased that actually i think it was dollar wise might be an all time high here  as you look back at your q1 business  how or what your sales cycles look like  are you able at continue to close deals at similar rates  or is there anything in the macro that might be accelerating or delaying some of those sales cycles nir debbiyeah  so to be honest  i think after i would a slight delay sometime in mid half last year  as of    i would say  late last year  this q1 we are more optimistic that merchants are    i would say  starting to see a light at the end of the tunnel and we see a willing to make commitments faster  is the main change we see is on the larger project side where we see more rfps coming in  a more interest from large merchants than if that continues  we do expect it to affect very positively our 2025 launches  so it s pipeline that is being built now  very strong one  and we believe that if this continues along the year as we will see a very positive effect on our 2025 business scott berggot it  that s very helpful  thank you  and then as you all look at six months into the market s pro opportunity with shopify  you seem pleased with current traction at least year to date and what the second half looks like  but are there additional levers that you believe that you can pull  maybe that on impact this year  maybe it s more impacting next year in fiscal  25  but are there additional levers that you can pull to maybe it accelerates some of the merchant adoption of that platform amir schlachetyeah  thanks  scott  it s amir  so as you said  and as we noted  we re indeed pleased with the pace in which our merchants are onboarding and the gmv is amassing  and yes  there is a joint pipeline and roadmap between us and shopify  which is aimed at constantly adding more features and enhancing the solution  which by itself should enlarge the applicability of the solution for additional merchants and accelerate down the line into as indicated into next year and beyond  the pace in which it is adopted  in addition  as a reminder  this market s pro currently available just for us based merchants  again  as part of our roadmap into the future  we do also plan together with shopify down the line to open the markets for offering for merchants from additional markets like the uk and others that s still there s no date yet set  it s still in the future  but when that goes online  it will further accelerate the adoption rate scott bergunderstood  very helpful  thanks and congrats again on good quarter amir schlachetwelcome operatorjames faucette  morgan stanley james faucettegreat  thank you  i wanted to ask just a couple of follow up questions  first  in terms of your existing customers  i know you said that the nrr was kind of moving around and wasn t quite as strong as it has been historically  but can you give us a little color on how the same store sales component of that is tracking in if you ve made any adjustments to how that s being incorporated into your outlook for this year ofer korensure  thank you for that  james  it s offer  so i was referring previously mainly to that component that the same store sales has been lower than the historical average and it has been volatile  however  we see it sort of stabilizing around the levels that we ve assumed or used for our budget  so there was a drop in mid february that we talked about in the previous quarter  then it came back  and since then it is sort of hovering around the same levels with some volatility james faucettegreat  appreciate that  and then one back on shopify  shopify markets pro and it sounds like that that s continuing to track well  if you can give us a little more insight into how that develops sequentially and then and clearly  you re doing a lot to add incremental functionality is    i guess the comment that that ll increase the applicability  is that built into the acceleration you re expecting in the latter part of this year  or should we think about there being more of a lag and there being more of an impact in trajectory in  25  thanks amir schlachetyeah  thanks  james  so in terms of the adoption rate  we see a constant stream of merchants that is joining and it s where constantly working  not just on features that have to do with the offering itself  but also the onboarding process  which is not less important and making it even more seamless and even faster for merchants to onboard and start trading  so this together with the larger appeal as we roll down  roll out  more features should gradually enhance that kind of daily or weekly pace of merchants joining the platform  so we do bake into our assumptions going forward  the kind of gradual increase in that base when we look on a longer term  but also take into account that these are all new merchants  so as the year progresses  we should get increasingly meaningful because we get more and more of these merchants to trade in parallel on the platform operatorbrent bracelin  piper sandler brent bracelini thank you  so it sounds like the large merchants here are helping drive the second half acceleration  it sounds like you re getting more interest from large merchants in the pipeline  i just wanted to double click into why now  could you talk about why these large merchants are now turning to global e  the tough macro out there  there s certainly challenges  so love to better explain kind of why you re seeing the large buckets it over to global e now  thanks nir debbihi  brent  it s nir  then overall  we have seen a movement toward larger merchants that started in covid  covid pushed much more larger retailers towards accelerating the direct to consumer approach  especially on a global level as most of them had it in the home market  and we do see this being accelerated now with more rfps coming out as domestic markets i assume are more challenging or more saturated for many of them  and they do want to have a further growth and further profitability that can be provided by a direct to consumer and not to wholesale or middlemen in different countries around the world  so we do expect it to continue to grow  and i think it also relates to globally positioning that overtime build much more expertise and brand position as market leader in supporting those large brands  generating great results and making the operations much more seamless and simple  trading around the world  and we continue to see this growing and accelerating over time as we able to build more capabilities  as being much more localized in more markets around the world and gain and generate more data out of this growth  of the combination of it all  i think creates this flywheel effect that would continue to attract a larger business into the company as we see it brent bracelin applause   thanks for that  and then i know for your    if i think about the gmv growth guide at the midpoint versus the revenue guide at the midpoint  can you just talk a little bit about take rate and expectations on take rate  what s driving improvement here in q2 ofer korenso basically  as we mentioned previously  we expect    while we do expect some volatility in take rates  depending on specific gmv mix  we expect it to be much more stable if you look at the entire year compared to previous years  so we expect it to be close to 16  over the year with less volatility between quarters  as we ve mentioned  we do see multi local growth normalizing not because they re those merchants are not growing  they re growing very nicely  but last year  they either that the larger of those either expanded their business with us or launched the business with us  so it was a unique year in that perspective  so we see more normalized take rate  there aren t many changes  it s mainly so the margin movement depending on the gmv mix  but we do expect it to stabilize below 16  brent bracelinmakes sense  thank you so much ofer korenthanks  brent operatorandrew basch  wells fargo andrew baschhey  good morning  thanks for taking the question  i just wanted to get a product update on the demand then solution that you re planning to launch in the second half and maybe an update on early receptiveness you heard from clients and whether that can meaningfully move the needle on revenues or margins as we get in the back half of the year nir debbihi  thank you for the question  it s nir  we continue to invest in building out the margin capabilities  we did over the last few quarters  build expertise and an in house specialized agency to support our brands in growing the demand generation  in the second part of the year  we are going to launch to support it based on the borderfree acquisition  a unique proposition  that would support us in driving our brands s growth  we are now in the early stages of introducing this solution to our merchants  we it s    not it s not like for them yet  it s just being introduced to them now in order to get the buy in in order to get them live on it in the second part of the year  we do see a very great interest in it and we do expect high adoption  we do believe it will accelerate the growth and we will start seeing positive effect as of the last quarter of the year  but much more when we re looking to add 2025 onwards  it does go into as we see it accelerate our growth  and our clients  growth based on actually increasing ndl  we expect that the trading merchants today and merchants that will launch with us in the future would be able to penetrate new markets and increase the footfall in current markets with the services  so we do have high hopes to it  most of it will not materialize  of course  in 2024  we do see it as a contribution that s going to grow as of 2025 onwards andrew baschdefinitely something to look forward to  touching on adjusted ebitda  another nice quarter of stability there  just thinking about the back half ramp with markets grow and with the two large merchants  how do you feel from an investment perspective that you re positioned today  and how do you think that can translate to margins as we get in the back half of this year and then into 2025  just trying to better understand the modeling here ofer korenso ebitda  as reflected in our guidance  we expect the margin to grow    to continue to grow in 2024 and to be around 18   the economics of new merchants coming in or the shopify markets  the flow offering  obviously  those are large merchants  the economics are a bit different  but on the same level  we launched many smaller merchants in the first half of the year  so there is a balance there  we don t expect any significant changes  we expect to see an improvement over time as reflected in our guidance for the entire year as well amir schlachetand it s amir  i ll just add maybe that we do or we ve spoken a couple of times in the past and also in this call  we strongly believe that there is a huge greenfield opportunity still ahead of us  so we do  it s important to note that we do still prioritize growth over profitability  so whenever we see and we continue to see you all the time opportunities to reinvest in the business  of course  always watching our operations  expenses growth and making sure that we continue to gradually improve on margins  but still we continue to invest in adding more resources on both on the r d side and across the rest of the business to make sure that we are continue to be well positioned to capture this opportunity operatorpat walravens  jmp pat walravensoh  great  thank you  so amir  big picture  you have all these growth drivers  you ve got shopify  you can go more in the us  they go internationally  just launched with mix  you re adding more and bigger brands  you have the demand gen solution coming out  so the question is what are the constraints on the ability of this company to scale  you re going to do  1 billion next year  why can t it grow to  10 billion amir schlacheti don t think we can t  i think we can  pat  i think it s the opportunity is there  i think our product market fit is there  i think we have in the pipeline  also additional complementary services that we can add  so all of that together  i think we re on the right path to continue growing  we are also constantly working on enlarging our already significant ecosystem of great partners around us where they can contribute to our growth and we can contribute to their growth  so i think the main constraints are time  and of course  as always  execution  and we continue to focus on execution  we continue to make sure that we do the best job possible for the growth of our merchants and we believe that as we continue to do so  growth will continue to come and we can continue to materialize that opportunity ahead of us pat walravensawesome  right  and i m looking forward to seeing you guys on wednesday until then congratulations amir schlachetsame here  thanks  pat operatormaddie schrage  keybanc capital markets maddie schragehey  guys  and thank you for taking my question  i was just wondering if you can give an update on the borderfree migration  just kind of wondering maybe what percentage of customers have moved over to the global e platform and kind of any early learnings on that uplift that you could potentially see there  thanks amir schlachetso we do continue to work with the clients toward migration to end    by the end of this year or latest if we ll see as there is a need for it early q1 next year  the clients that have migrated  we have seen great results in uplifting the sales conversion rates  driving better performance  better sales based on the    i would say  a larger suite of solutions and services on our platform  we do expect that once the vast majority of borderfree clients would migrate  we will see a better trading with them in the following quarter    in the following quarters  so we are optimistic about it  it is as we indicated in the past  going slower than initially expected  so we do believe that some of it will roll out into q1 of next year  however  we are happy with the results that we have seen on migrated clients maddie schragegreat  and then just a quick follow up  do you have any call outs from maybe a geo perspective  are there any standouts in terms of inbound markets  either headwinds or tailwinds  thanks amir schlacheti think that we constantly see different changes in different markets around the world in terms of inbound volumes as some countries face a more challenging macro  you see there a growth  a declining  some of the markets are affected by geopolitics  if you look at the inbound into israel and ukraine  where you see the market is actually shrinking in two digit percentage base heavily  but because of our global nature and amount of corridors we sell into as an actuary  i think that all in all  as ofer indicated  and we do see some stability  so it s overall numbers are slightly below historical averages  but in line with what we expected for this year  which was  i would say  a bit softer macro in general than previous years  despite the fact that  yes  there is volatility  some weeks looks better or less  but overall  i think what we do see now is stable  a relatively okay macro  not as great as previous years  but i would say an okay  macro in general reflected in same store sales across different corridors operatormark zgutowicz  the benchmark company mark zgutowiczthank you  hi  guys  just a question around the onboarding process for markets pro merchants  i know there s been some progress made there and just curious in terms of lifting the friction there  are those capabilities now in place  are there still more enhancements that may accelerate the onboarding of us merchants  and then is this the key variable in terms of moving markets pro outside the us with shopify  thanks nir debbiyeah  and thank you for the question  it s nir  we do continue to roll out features and the process alignments in order to make the onboarding quicker  more seamless and to gain a great but even better results out of the gate  however  also on the ongoing trading and is a market segments and vertical that the solution is geared for  we do have still a rollout plan of different feature and capabilities  that will be rolled out to the coming quarters  on the back of this completion  of course  we would go into a much wider rollout  but this is dependent  of course  on shopify and our decisions  but we are fully aligned on the roadmap ahead and what we need to achieve in the coming quarters in order to continue with the rollout mark zgutowiczthanks  nir  that s helpful  and then one quick one for over possibly on luxury  just curious how that segment is pacing first half versus it was just year over year first up year over year  thanks ofer korenyeah  so regarding luxury  2023 was not a good year for luxury as we discussed several times  and since then  we ve seen it sort of  double  and coming back to growth  not very strong growth  but after the lows that we have seen during some of the quarters  mainly  i think it was in q3 last year  it has stabilized and gone back to growth  maybe not growing as fast as other segments  but positive growth operatormatt coad  kelly  autonomous research matt coadhey  guys  thanks for taking the question  i m curious if you could unpack the growth in sales and marketing expenses ex the one amortization  sorry about that  it s growing at a really fast pace  as you noted in your prepared remarks  just curious  a lot of this growth coming mainly from shopify s revenue share or are there changes to your go to market approach that we should be aware of  thanks ofer korensure  so as you mentioned  we do have sort of a variable cost in our sales and marketing  which is the shopify rev share component and it is growing  so i think most of the growth in expenses or the    not most of the growth  but most of the extra growth is due to shopify rev share expenses  however  nothing special to report  but we are continuously expanding our sales force  it s a gradual expansion  but as we grow  we are bringing in more people  but not anything out of the ordinary operatormatt o neill  ft partners matt o neillhey  gentlemen  thanks so much for receiving me in at the end  a lot of good questions asked and answered  maybe first  ofer  i know you mentioned a couple of points contributing to the gross take rate that ll stabilize close to  16  you mentioned  this quarter  the net take rate actually outperformed by a good amount and i was just curious if there s any call outs to attribute that to anything that we should expect to be stickier going forward or if it was maybe more of a mix shift  and then i ll just get my follow up in there now  and a bunch of people asked about shopify markets pro and specifically the international rollout  that s one thing just from a time line perspective to be conservative  we should think about international markets there as it 2025 and beyond type of a discussion  thanks a lot nir debbiin terms of the international rollout  i think it s also dependent on shopify plans  so we can t commit or comment about it without being aligned with shopify  but i do expect that if we in the coming quarters  we will meet our target  we will see additional market being rolled in when i think it s much more decision for shopify to make matt o neillunderstood  and on the net take rate this quarter  anything to think about going forward or maybe some unique mix elements that were idiosyncratic ofer korenso as we previously stated  some of it is due to gmv mix  however  we do see a clear line of improvement over time  due to one efficiencies  so  different processes we brought in  we have a team  very senior team that is going through the organization and mapping it for ai initiatives  i think that we ve mentioned in the previous call that we had some very nice processes that are implemented  that are already contributing mainly around our service but also in other areas  so this is just an example  another example is classification  duty classifications  and we do have quite a few initiatives  but it s not just the  iron  initiative  but also other processes and also economies of scale that we re pushing  so over time  we do expect to see an improvement  however  as i mentioned this  the gross margin we had this quarter was high and some of it was due to this specific revenue and gmv mix operatorthank you  there are no further questions at this time  i d now like to turn the call back over to mr  amir schlachet for final closing comments amir schlachetthank you very much  and thank you  everyone  for joining us today  and we very much look forward to seeing you again on our future earnings calls  just before we adjourn  i would like to take this opportunity again to say a big thank you to all of our wonderful team members throughout the world  your hard work and complete dedication to the success of our merchants are and will always be the key driving force behind our continued growth and success  so goodbye to all and take care operatorthank you  so ladies and gentlemen  this concludes your conference call for today  we thank you for participating and ask that you please disconnect your lines ',

These and other key performance indicators are discussed in more detail in our press release dated May 20, 2024. I will now turn the call over to Amir, co-founder and CEO.Amir Schlachet -- Co-Founder and Chief Executive OfficerThank you, Erica, and welcome, everyone. With the financial results of Q1, which we are releasing today, we are off to a great start of what we believe will be yet another pivotal year of growth for Global-e. GMV, revenues, and adjusted EBITDA will be at the top of our forecasted range for the quarter, with GMV growing 32% year-on-year, revenues growing 24%, and adjusted EBITDA growing 47%. These strong results manifest our team's continued execution across all elements of the business, coupled with our effectiveness in controlling costs and the fact that macro conditions during the quarter were slightly more favorable than what we initially anticipated back in February.Moreover, we remain confident in our ability to uphold our plans for the remainder of the year, as is reflected in our updated guidance for the full year of 2024. Most notably, the large client launches planned for the second half of the year are on track and Shopify Markets Pro continues to amass merchants at the planned pace. Among other things, we believe both these factors will contribute to our ability to accelerate growth in the second half of the year. Later in this call, Ofer will review our Q1 results in more detail, and he will provide you with our guidance for Q2 and our raised guidance for the full year of 2024.But before we do that, I would like to share with you some of the exciting business developments we have seen recently. During Q1, we continue to experience strong demand for our services across all markets we operate in. Q1's so many renowned brands go live with Global-e services. In the U.S., designer brands Donna Karan and DKNY, footwear brand HEYDUDE by Crocs, and sports fashion brand Golf Wang all went live, as did Imperial Workshop, our first U.S.merchant on the Wix platform. Thanks to the combination of Wix and Global-e, all aspiring Jedi Knights can now do their essential lightsaber shopping online on the Imperial Workshop website, regardless of where they live. Of course, as long as they -- it's not in a galaxy far, far away. During the quarter, we also launched with lingerie brand La Senza in Canada, as well as high street fashion brand Hobbs and T.M.Lewin, luggage brand Antler, and a homeware brand Soho Home in the U.K. In Europe, we launched with the French vintage style fashion brand Louise Misha; with fashion brands Gerard Darel, Soeur, and Caroll; and with the renowned luxury lifestyle brand Repetto, which, thanks to Global-e, can now sell its iconic ballerina shoes worldwide as seamlessly and effectively as it does so in France. The quarter also saw the launches of innovative fashion brand Marc Cain and the online store of workwear and protective gear retailer Engelbert Strauss, both in Germany. Moreover, we launched with the leisure brand Pacha in Spain with its famous cherries logo, women's luxury fashion brand Costarellos in Greece, and the fashion brand Rubato in Sweden, among many others.Our business in APAC continues to expand all the time as well, with examples of recent launches in the region being Infamous Swim and Carla Zampatti in Australia; Hi, mu-mo by Avex and commonsmart in Japan; DIY Watch Club in Hong Kong; and more. During Q1, we also continued our efforts to expand our business with existing merchants and with brand groups. As such, we opened new markets for adidas and DOEN and went live with Infiniment, an additional brand from the Coty Group. We also went live with Tap To Style, a new brand by MODES in Italy, who themselves just went live the previous quarter; and with NNormal, a new Spanish brand from the Camper Group.With dozens of other brands going live and with robust integration and sales pipelines, we believe we can continue on our growth path into the future as more and more merchants put emphasis on global direct-to-consumer sales. Switching gears, I would like to update you regarding the various components of our strategic partnership with Shopify. On the 3P or direct integration side, the migration of our historical merchant base onto the new native integration is nearing completion, and the team's focus has turned now toward the continued gradual transition of all Shopify merchants onto checkout extensibility. On the 1P or Shopify Markets Pro side, merchants continue to sign up and go live, gradually amassing GMV at the planned rate.In parallel, the teams on both sides continue to work on developing additional features and capabilities, further enhancing the solutions' reach. Given the large market potential on the Shopify platform and as adoption of the innovative Markets Pro solution continues to rise, we remain highly convinced in our ability to capture a meaningful part of this massive market opportunity over the course of the next few years. With all these exciting developments and with many others across the entire business, we continue to believe more than ever in our ability to exhibit long-term and durable growth as we capture more and more of the vast greenfield opportunity that lies ahead of us. I will now hand it to Ofer, our CFO, to take us through the quarterly numbers in more depth, as well as present our updated guidance going forward.Ofer Koren -- Chief Financial OfficerThank you, Amir, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today for our earnings call. We are off to a strong start in 2024. Q1 was another quarter of fast growth and robust adjusted EBITDA as we continue to drive progress on all fronts and remain committed to delivering value to merchants in their international initiatives. I'd like to point out again that in addition to our GAAP results, I'll also be discussing certain non-GAAP results.Our GAAP financial results, along with the reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results, can be found in our earnings release. As Amir mentioned, we have experienced rapid growth of GMV in Q1 as we generated $930 million of GMV, an increase of 32% year over year, 3.9% over the midpoint of our guidance for Q1. We continue to benefit from the growth of global e-commerce, which is back to its pre-COVID long-term pattern, taking share from brick-and-mortar retail, and the continued focus of merchants on direct-to-consumer while there is still uncertainty regarding consumer demand, which remains volatile. In Q1, we generated total revenue of $145.9 million, up 24% year over year; service fee revenue were $68.3 million, up 36%; and fulfillment services revenue were up 15% to $77.6 million.The higher growth of service fee revenue compared to fulfillment services revenue was mainly driven by the higher share of our multilocal offering. As reflected in our guidance, we expect take rates to stabilize at close to 16%, driven by elevated levels of fulfillment services adoption. Non-GAAP gross profit continued to outpace revenue growth. In Q1, non-GAAP gross profit was $66.1 million, up 36% year over year, representing a gross margin of 45.3%, compared to 41.4% in the same period last year, driven by the higher share of service fee revenue and our continuous efficiency efforts.GAAP gross profit was $63.3 million, representing a margin of 43.4%. Moving on to operational expenses. We continue to invest in the development of our platform to further enhance and expand our offering. R&D expense in Q4, excluding stock-based compensation, was $20.1 million or 13.8% of revenue, compared to $16.9 million or 14.3% in the same period last year.Total R&D spend in Q4 was $23.5 million. We also continue to invest in sales and marketing to expand our pipeline while maintaining efficiencies. Sales and marketing expense, excluding Shopify-related amortization expenses, stock-based compensation, acquisition-related intangibles amortization, was $17.2 million or 11.8% of revenue, compared to $10.5 million or 8.9% of revenue in the same period last year. Shopify warrant-related amortization expense was $36.3 million.Total sales and marketing expenses for the quarter were $57 million. General and administrative expenses, excluding stock-based compensation, acquisition-related expenses, and acquisition-related contingent consideration, was $8.3 million or 5.7% of revenue, compared to $7.4 million or 6.3% of revenue in the same period last year. Total G&A spend in Q1 was $12.1 million. Adjusted EBITDA continues to grow rapidly and totaled $21.3 million, representing a 14.6% adjusted EBITDA margin and increasing by 47% from $14.5 million or 12.3% margin in the same period last year.Net loss was $32.1 million, compared to a net loss of $43.1 million in the year-ago period, driven mainly by the amortization expenses related to the Shopify warrants and by the transaction-related intangibles. Switching gears and turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statements. We ended the quarter with $298 million in cash, cash equivalents, including short-term deposits and marketable securities. Cash flow used by operating activities was $54.3 million, compared to $29.5 million used a year ago, driven by typical first quarter post-peak working capital dynamics and a 12.2 million payment of held-back acquisition-related proceeds to the Flow founders.Moving on to our financial outlook and guidance for Q2 and our updated 2024 full year guidance. For Q2 2024, we are expecting GMV to be in the range of $1.025 billion to $1.065 billion. At the midpoint of the range, this represents a growth rate of 27% versus Q2 of 2023. We expect Q2 revenue to be in the range of $162.5 million to $168.5 million.At the midpoint of the range, this represents a growth rate of 24% versus Q2 of 2023. For adjusted EBITDA, we are expecting a profit in the range of $24.5 million to $28.5 million. For the full year of 2024, we are raising our guidance and now anticipate GMV to be in the range of $4.625 billion to $4.865 billion, representing a 33.4 annual growth rate at the midpoint of the range. Revenue is now expected to be in the range of $733 million to $773 million, representing growth rate of 32.1% at the midpoint of the range.For adjusted EBITDA, we're now expecting a profit of $124 million to $140 million. We continue to believe growth will accelerate in the second half of the year, driven by large merchant launches planned for H2, which are on track; anticipated elevated volume contribution from Shopify Markets Pro, which is growing as expected; and a lower impact from border-free on a year-on-year comparison. In conclusion, the opportunity in front of us remains massive and we continue our journey to support merchants worldwide in expanding their direct-to-consumer business. We focus on execution and believe we can continue to grow rapidly while further expanding cash generation in the coming years.And with that, Amir, Nir, and I are happy to answer questions you may have. Operator.Questions & Answers:OperatorThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Will Nance from Goldman Sachs. Go ahead, please.Will Nance -- Goldman Sachs -- AnalystHey, guys. Good morning. I appreciate you taking the question. I know you had a comment in the prepared remarks that the macro environment ended up being a little bit better than the expectations in the first quarter, and I'm just wondering if you could kind of speak to what you're seeing so far in 2Q just given some of the negative data points around luxury spending.And, you know, is anything -- have you guys noticed any change in spending patterns over the last month and a half?Amir Schlachet -- Co-Founder and Chief Executive OfficerHey, Will. Thanks for the question. Basically, we haven't seen any material changes in Q2 so far. Things continue to be volatile in terms of macro conditions.We see it basically in the trading patterns. But our anticipation and what we've seen so far in Q2 and our assumption for the remainder of Q2 is that the volatility and, hence, the macro environment, in general, will remain similar to what we've seen in Q1.Will Nance -- Goldman Sachs -- AnalystThat's super helpful. And then can you just talk about the pipeline of product enhancements on the Markets Pro side, things like fulfillment and just what the rollout schedule for things look -- for things like that would be?Nir Debbi -- Co-Founder and PresidentHey, Will. It's Nir. We continue to work according to our road map, developing enhancements and features toward Shopify Markets Pro, and we continue to roll those out. I think, over the next few quarters, we will see a gradual rollout of all the key elements we are working toward, and we expect that to continue and accelerate the growth in the coming quarters of the solutions adoption.Will Nance -- Goldman Sachs -- AnalystGot it. I appreciate you taking the questions.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Samad Samana from Jefferies. Go ahead, please.Samad Samana -- Jefferies -- AnalystHi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So, maybe first, you guys mentioned multiple times that Markets Pro that the merchant ramp is tracking to plan.Can you just remind us what the planned target is, whether that's in terms of number of merchants or GMV that you're targeting for 2024 and what have you assumed in guidance for the rest of the year?Nir Debbi -- Co-Founder and PresidentHi, Samad. We haven't guided for specific numbers of what we expect this year on Markets Pro. In the future, as we indicated before, once it becomes a large enough business lines, we will look at more clarity, specifically on Markets Pro. However, the market expectations, as reflected between different markets reports, is in line with what we see today.So, we are trading within the numbers that are outside in the market.Samad Samana -- Jefferies -- AnalystUnderstood. And then maybe just, Ofer, as I think about the -- I know you mentioned what drove the quarter, but I didn't catch NRR. Could you maybe help us understand how NRR tracked through the quarter and what you've observed maybe post-quarter and if that's tracking to kind of historical assumptions that you've seen over the last few years?Ofer Koren -- Chief Financial OfficerYeah. So, hey, Samad. Thanks for the question. So, as you know, we provide the annual NDR, NRR numbers.However, generally speaking, we can say that while, as Amir mentioned, there is volatility in consumer behavior, all in all, except for the lower two weeks in February, it has been around or just slightly below the numbers we usually see or the numbers we've expected for this year. So, it's not at its peak and it's -- it is below average, but it's more or less in line with what we've expected for 2024.Samad Samana -- Jefferies -- AnalystGreat. Thanks again and congrats on a strong quarter.Ofer Koren -- Chief Financial OfficerThank you.Amir Schlachet -- Co-Founder and Chief Executive OfficerThanks, Samad.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Brian Peterson from Raymond James. Go ahead, please.Brian Peterson -- Raymond James -- AnalystThanks, gentlemen, and congrats on the quarter. So, I know you mentioned some commentary on the macro. I'm curious how that relates to the top of the funnel. What are you seeing in terms of pipeline creation and deal timing thus far in 2024?Nir Debbi -- Co-Founder and PresidentHey. Hi. It's Nir. Thank you for the question.For now, what we see as year to date is that our pipelines remain strong or even stronger than what we've seen ever in the past. We are looking toward the second part of the year where we expect the launch of several large merchants that are currently in project state, as well as the signing of at least additional one. And so, we're quite optimistic. I don't think that we ever had a pipeline in terms of sheer dollars that is -- that was as strong as this one.Brian Peterson -- Raymond James -- AnalystThat's great to hear. And, Ofer, maybe just a follow-up, you had a nice beat in gross margins this quarter. I know the mix is maybe a little bit different, but want to understand what drove that and how we should be thinking about modeling gross margins going forward. Thanks, guys.Ofer Koren -- Chief Financial OfficerThat -- so, yeah, gross margins have been high this quarter, and that is due to two factors. The first one is actually the mix of revenue. So, service fee share was higher compared to last year, to the parallel quarter. And in addition, we are continuously working on efficiencies, improving processes, and so on and so forth.So, this contributed as well. Going forward, we don't expect -- as we previously stated, we don't expect any significant expansion this year. We are happy with the level of gross margins we currently have. So, going forward, we do not expect a significant increase.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Koji Ikeda from Bank of America. Go ahead, please.Koji Ikeda -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- AnalystYeah. Hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking the questions. I wanted to ask on the guidance here, just thinking about the GMV guidance specifically.And when I look at the second quarter guide and the full quarter guide and a little bit of the historical seasonal pattern in GMV, it looks like a pretty heavy ramp into the fourth quarter here. So, just trying to understand or maybe a bit more qualitative color in the way you're thinking about linearity in GMV ramp for the rest of the year. Thank you.Ofer Koren -- Chief Financial OfficerYeah. So, you're right, this year is not our typical year, and we've discussed that in the previous quarter as well. H2 growth takes into account few drivers. The first one is the large client launches that we expect and currently are on track, on time.So, this is one main contributor. In previous years, we had large client launches, but they were not all in the second half of the year. The second driver is obviously Shopify Markets Pro, which is ramping up. So, we expect it to contribute more in H2.And it is currently -- as we mentioned, it's on target, so we feel quite confident with the way it's progressing. The third one is we do expect to see reduced effect of border-free -- border-free is weighing on our growth a bit due to the nature of the merchants trading on border-free, a lot of large department stores and so on. And as we go forward, one, its share of our volume is decreasing because the other business is growing; and we are migrating those merchants to Global-e and we expect to see uplifts once those migrations are done. So, those are the main drivers behind the H2 growth.Koji Ikeda -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- AnalystGot it. Thank you. And just a follow-up here on the large merchants that you've mentioned that you're expecting to come on in the second half. It definitely sounds like it's a positive and on the progression here to get them to go live, but it also sounds like it's a pretty big risk to guidance if they don't go live.So, maybe you could speak to what is giving you that confidence that these guys will be able to get the Global-e platform live later this year? Thanks, guys.Nir Debbi -- Co-Founder and PresidentHi, Koji. It's Nir. The large projects are currently on track. It's projects that are already deep into the project phase of it in order to launch in Q3 and early Q4 because no one launches in November, December.Usually, everybody is doing it pre-peak. So, in the next four months, in order to launch, large merchants are already deep into the integration and the testing cycle. So, we do have high confidence that it is happening. While there is always a risk of delay, we do have a high level of confidence, based on the current status of the project, that it's actually going to go as planned.So, as we do take some, I would say, some level of conservatism into our guidance -- on our guidance, of course, we do have -- we did factor out certain delays, a few weeks here, a few weeks there, in order to absorb minor changes in the launches.Koji Ikeda -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- AnalystThank you. Thank you for taking the questions.Amir Schlachet -- Co-Founder and Chief Executive OfficerThanks, Koji.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Scott Berg from Needham. Go ahead, please.Scott Berg -- Needham and Company -- AnalystHi, everyone. Nice quarter. Thanks for taking my questions. Nir, I think it was you that responded to the pipeline question in the second half and pleased that, actually, I think it was, dollar-wise, might be an all-time high here.As you look back at your Q1 business, how are -- what do sales cycles look like? Are you able to continue to close deals at similar rates or is there anything in the back row that might be accelerating or delaying some of those sales cycles?Nir Debbi -- Co-Founder and PresidentYeah. So, to be honest, I think after, I'll say, a slight delay sometime in mid-half last year, as of, I would say, late last year or this Q1, we are more optimistic that merchants are, I would say, starting to see light at the end of the tunnel and we see willing to make commitments faster. The main change we see is on the larger project side where we see more RFPs coming in and more interest from large merchants. And if that continues, we do expect it to affect very positively our 2025 launches.So, it's pipelines that is being built now, very strong one. And we believe that if this continues along the year, it -- we will see a very positive effect on our 2025 business.Scott Berg -- Needham and Company -- AnalystGot it. Very helpful. Thank you. And then as you all look at six months into the Markets Pro opportunity with Shopify, you seem pleased with the current traction, at least year to date, and what the second half looks like.But are there additional levers that you believe that you can pull? Maybe they don't impact this year, maybe it's more impacting next year in fiscal '25, but are there additional levers that you can pull to maybe accelerate some of the merchant adoption of that platform?Amir Schlachet -- Co-Founder and Chief Executive OfficerYeah. Thanks, Scott. It's Amir. So, as you said and as we noted, we're, indeed, pleased with the pace in which merchants are onboarding and that GMV is amassing.And yes, there is a joint pipeline and road map between us and Shopify, which is aimed at constantly adding more features and enhancing the solution, which, by itself, should enlarge the applicability of the solutions for additional merchants and accelerate down the line, as you indicated, into next year and beyond, the pace in which it is adopted. In addition, as a reminder, this Markets Pro is currently available just for U.S.-based merchants. Again, as part of our road map into the future, we do also plan, together with Shopify, down the line to open the Markets Pro offering for merchants from additional markets like the U.K. and others.That's still -- there's no date yet set. It's still in the future. But when that goes online, it will further accelerate the adoption rate.Scott Berg -- Needham and Company -- AnalystUnderstood. Very helpful. Thanks and congrats again on a good quarter.Amir Schlachet -- Co-Founder and Chief Executive OfficerThanks, Scott.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. Go ahead, please.James Faucette -- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystGreat. Thank you. I wanted to ask just a couple of follow-up questions. First, in terms of your existing customers, I know you said that the NRR was kind of moving around and wasn't quite as strong as it has been historically.But can you give us a little color on how the same-store sales component of that is tracking and if you've made any adjustments to how that's being incorporated into your outlook for this year?Ofer Koren -- Chief Financial OfficerSure. Thank you for that, James. It's Ofer. So, I was referring previously mainly to that component.The same-store sales has been lower than the historical average, and it has been volatile. However, we see sort of stabilizing around the levels that we've assumed or used for our budget. So, it's -- you know, there was a drop in mid-February that we talked about in the previous quarter, then it came back. And since then, it is sort of hovering around the same levels with some volatility.James Faucette -- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystGreat. Appreciate that. And then when -- back on, you know, Shopify and Shopify Markets Pro, can -- you know, it sounds like that that's continuing to track well. If you can give us a little more insight into how that develops sequentially? And then, you know, clearly, you're doing a lot to add incremental functionality.Is -- I guess the -- with the comment that that'll increase the applicability, is that built into the acceleration you're expecting in the latter part of this year or is -- should we think about there being more of a lag and there being more of an impact in trajectory in '25? Thanks.Amir Schlachet -- Co-Founder and Chief Executive OfficerYeah. Thanks, James. So, in terms of the adoption rate, we see a constant stream of merchants that is joining, and it's -- we're constantly working, not just on features that have to do with the offering itself, but also the onboarding process, which is not less important, and making it even more seamless and even faster for merchants to onboard and start trading. So, this, together with the larger appeal as we roll down -- or roll out more features, should gradually enhance that kind of daily or weekly pace of merchants joining the platform.So, we do bake into our assumptions going forward the kind of gradual increase in that pace when we look on a longer term, but also taking into account that these are all new merchants. So, as the year progresses, we should get -- it should get increasingly meaningful because we get more and more of these merchants to trade in parallel on the platform.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brent Bracelin from Piper Sandler. Go ahead, please.Brent Bracelin -- Piper Sandler -- AnalystThank you. So, sounds like the large merchants here are helping drive this second half acceleration. It sounds like you're getting more interest from large merchants in the pipeline. I just wanted to double-click into why now.Could you talk about why these large merchants are now turning to Global-e? The tough macro out there. There are certainly challenges. So, I'd love to better explain kind of why you're seeing the large markets turn to Global-e now. Thanks.Nir Debbi -- Co-Founder and PresidentHi, Brent. It's Nir. Then, overall, we have seen a movement toward larger merchants that started in COVID. COVID pushed much more larger retailers toward accelerating the direct-to-consumer approach, especially on a global level, as most of them had it in their home markets.And we do see this being accelerated now with more RFPs coming out as domestic markets, I assume, are more challenging or more saturated for many of them and they do want to have further growth and further profitability that can be provided by direct-to-consumer and not through wholesale or middlemen in different countries around the world. So, we do expect it to continue to grow. And I think it also relates to Global-e's positioning that, over time, builds much more expertise and brand position as market leader in supporting those large brands generating great results and making their operations much more seamless and simple trading around the world. And we continue to see this growing and accelerating over time as we're able to build more capabilities, being much more localized in more markets around the world, and gain and generate more data out of this growth.So, the combination of it all, I think, creates this flywheel effect that would continue to attract larger business into the company as we see it.Brent Bracelin -- Piper Sandler -- AnalystNir, thanks for that. And then, Ofer, if I think about the GMV growth guide at the midpoint versus the revenue guide at the midpoint, can you just talk a little bit about take rate and expectations on take rate and what's driving the improvement here in Q2?Ofer Koren -- Chief Financial OfficerYeah. So, basically, as we mentioned previously, we expect -- while we do expect some volatility in take rates, depending on specific GMV mix, we expect it to be much more stable. If you look at the entire year compared to previous years, we expect it to be close to 16% over the year, with less volatility between quarters. As we've mentioned, we do see multilocal growth normalizing, not because they're -- those merchants are not growing.They're growing very nicely. But last year, they either -- that the larger of those either expanded their business with us or launched the business with us, so it was a unique year in that perspective. So, we see more normalized take rates. There aren't many changes.It's mainly sort of marginal movement, depending on the GMV mix. But we do expect it to stabilize below 16%.Brent Bracelin -- Piper Sandler -- AnalystMakes sense. Thank you so much.Amir Schlachet -- Co-Founder and Chief Executive OfficerThanks, Brent.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Andrew Bauch from Wells Fargo. Go ahead, please.Andrew Bauch -- Wells Fargo Securities -- AnalystHey. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to get a product update on the demand gen solution that you were planning to launch in the second half.I mean, maybe an update on, you know, early receptiveness you've heard from clients and whether that can meaningfully move the needle on revenues or margins as we get in the back half of the year?Nir Debbi -- Co-Founder and PresidentHi. Thank you for the question. It's Nir. We continue to invest in building our demand gen capabilities.We did, over the last few quarters, build expertise and an in-house specialized agency to support our brands in growing their demand generation. In the second part of the year, we are going to launch to support it based on the border-free acquisition, a unique proposition that would support us in driving our brands' growth. We are now in the early stages of introducing this solution to our merchants. It's not live for them yet.It's just being introduced to them now in order to get the buy-in, in order to get them live on it in the second part of the year. We do see a very great interest in it, and we do expect high adoption. We do believe it will accelerate the growth, and we will start seeing positive effect as of the last quarter of the year, but much more when we look into 2025 onwards. This does -- going to, as we see it, accelerate our growth and our client's growth, based on actually increasing NDR.We expect that trading merchants today and merchants that will launch with us in the future would be able to penetrate new markets and increase their footfall in current markets with these services. So, we do have high hopes to it. Most of it will not materialize, of course, in 2024. We do see it as a contribution that's going to grow as of 2025 onwards.Andrew Bauch -- Wells Fargo Securities -- AnalystThat's definitely something to look forward to. Just touching on adjusted EBITDA. You know, another nice quarter of stability there. Just thinking about the back half ramp with Markets Pro and with the two large merchants, how do you feel from an investment perspective that you're positioned today and how do you think that that can translate to margins as we get in the back half of this year and then into 2025? Just trying to better understand the modeling here.Ofer Koren -- Chief Financial OfficerSo, EBITDA, you know, as reflected in our guidance, we expect the margin to grow -- to continue to grow in 2024 and to be around 18%. The economics of, you know, new merchants coming in or the Shopify Markets Pro offering, you know, obviously, if those are large merchants, the economics are a bit different. But on the same level, we've launched many smaller merchants in the first half of the year. So, there is a balance there.We don't expect any significant changes. We expect to see an improvement over time, as reflected in our guidance, for the entire year as well.Amir Schlachet -- Co-Founder and Chief Executive OfficerYeah. And it's Amir. I'll just add maybe that we do -- we've spoken a couple of times in the past and also in this call, we strongly believe that there's a huge greenfield opportunity still ahead of us. So, we do -- it's important to note that we do still prioritize growth over profitability.So, whenever we see and we continue to see all the time opportunities to reinvest in the business, of course, always watching our operational expenses growth and making sure that we continue to gradually improve on margins, but still, we continue to invest in adding more resources on -- both on the R&D side and across the rest of the business, to make sure that we continue to be well-positioned to capture this opportunity.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Pat Walravens from JMP. Please go ahead.Pat Walravens -- JMP Securities -- AnalystGreat. Thank you. So, Amir, big picture, you have all these growth drivers. You've got Shopify.You can go more in the U.S., then you can go internationally. You just launched with Wix. You're adding more bigger brands. You have the demand gen solution coming out.So, the question is what are the constraints on the ability of this company to scale? You know, you're going to do a billion next year. Why can't it grow to 10 billion?Amir Schlachet -- Co-Founder and Chief Executive OfficerI don't think we can't. I think we can, Pat. I think it's -- the opportunity is there. I think our product market fit is there.I think we have, in the pipeline, also additional complementary services that we can add. So, all of that together, I think we're on the right path to continue growing. We are also constantly working on enlarging our already significant ecosystem of great partners around us where they can contribute to our growth and we can contribute to their growth. So, I think the main constraints are time and, of course, as always, execution.And we continue to focus on execution. We continue to make sure that we do the best job possible for the growth of our merchants. And we believe that as we continue to do so, growth will continue to come and we can continue to materialize that opportunity ahead of us.Pat Walravens -- JMP Securities -- AnalystAwesome. All right. And I'm looking forward to seeing you guys on Wednesday in Tel Aviv. So, congratulations.Amir Schlachet -- Co-Founder and Chief Executive OfficerSame here. Thanks, Pat.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Maddie Schrage from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.Maddie Schrage -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- AnalystHey, guys, and thank you for taking my question. I was just wondering if you can give an update on the border-free migration. Just kind of wondering maybe what percentage of customers have moved over to the Global-e platform and kind of any early learnings on that uplift that you could potentially see there. Thanks.Nir Debbi -- Co-Founder and PresidentWe do continue to work with the clients toward migration to end by the end of this year or latest, if we see there is a need for it, early Q1 next year. The clients that have migrated, we have seen great results in uplifting the sales conversion rates, driving better performance, better sales, based on the, I would say, a larger suite of solutions and services on our platform. We do expect that once the vast majority of border-free clients would migrate, we will see a better trading with them in the following quarter -- in the following quarters. So, we are optimistic about it.It is, as we indicated in the past, going slower than initially expected, so we do believe that some of it will roll out into Q1 of next year. However, we are happy with the results that we have seen on migrated clients.Maddie Schrage -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- AnalystGreat. And then just a quick follow-up, do you have any callouts from maybe a geo perspective? Are there any standouts in terms of inbound markets, either headwinds or tailwinds? Thanks.Nir Debbi -- Co-Founder and PresidentI think that we constantly see different changes in different markets around the world in terms of inbound volumes. As some countries face more challenging macro, you see their growth declining. Some of it -- some of the markets are affected by geopolitics. If you look at the inbound into Israel or Ukraine, where you see the markets actually shrinking in two-digit percentage pace heavily.But because of our global nature and the amount of corridors we sell into, as -- and actually, I think that, all in all, as Ofer indicated, we do see some stability. So, the overall numbers are slightly below historical averages, but they are in line with what we expected for this year, which was, I would say, a bit softer macro, in general, than previous years. Despite the fact that, yes, there is volatility, some weeks looks better or less, but overall, I think that we do see now a stable, relatively OK macro. Not as great as in previous years, but I would say an OK macro, in general, reflected in same-store sales across different corridors.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Zgutowicz from the Benchmark Company. Go ahead, please.Mark Zgutowicz -- The Benchmark Company -- AnalystThank you. Hi, guys. Just a question around the onboarding process for Markets Pro merchants. I know there's been some progress made there.I'm just curious, in terms of, you know, lifting the friction there, are those capabilities now in place or are there still more enhancements that may accelerate the onboarding of U.S. merchants? And then is this the key variable in terms of moving Markets Pro outside the U.S. with Shopify? Thanks.Nir Debbi -- Co-Founder and PresidentYeah. Thank you for the question. It's Nir. We do continue to roll out features and process alignments in order to make the onboarding quicker, more seamless, and to gain a great -- even better results out of the gate.However, also on the ongoing trading and the market segments and vertical that the solution is geared for, we do have still a rollout plan of different features and capabilities that will be rolled out through the coming quarters. On the back of this completion, of course, we would go into a much wider rollout. But this is dependent, of course, on Shopify and their decisions. But we are fully aligned on the road map ahead and what we need to achieve in the coming quarters in order to continue with the rollout.Mark Zgutowicz -- The Benchmark Company -- AnalystThanks, Nir. That's helpful. And then one quick one for Ofer, possibly, on luxury. Just curious how that segment is pacing first half versus -- or just year over year -- first half year over year? Thanks.Ofer Koren -- Chief Financial OfficerYes. So, regarding luxury, 2023 was not a good year for luxury, as we discussed several times. And since then, we've seen it sort of stabilizing and coming back to growth, not very strong growth. But after the lows that we have seen during some of the quarters, mainly, I think, it was in Q3 last year, it has stabilized and gone back to growth, maybe not growing as fast as other segments, but positive growth.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Coad from Autonomous Research. Go ahead, please.Matt Coad -- Autonomous Research -- AnalystHi. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I'm curious if you could unpack the growth in sales and marketing expenses, ex the warrant amortization, sorry about that.It's growing at a really fast pace, as you noted in your prepared remarks. Just curious, is a lot of this growth coming mainly from Shopify's revenue share, or are there changes to your go-to-market approach that we should be aware of? Thanks.Ofer Koren -- Chief Financial OfficerSure. So, as you mentioned, we do have sort of a variable cost in our sales and marketing, which is the Shopify rev share component, and it is growing. So, I think most of the growth in expenses or the -- not most of the growth, but most of the extra growth is due to Shopify rev share expenses. However, nothing special to report, but we are, you know, continuously expanding our sales force.It's a gradual expansion. But, you know, as we grow, we are bringing in more people, but not anything out of the ordinary.OperatorThank you. We will take our last question from the line of Matt O'Neill from FT Partners. Go ahead, please.Matt O'Neill -- Financial Technology Partners -- AnalystHey, gentlemen. Thanks so much for squeezing me in at the end. A lot of good questions were asked and answered. Maybe first, Ofer, I know you mentioned a couple of points contributing to the growth in take rate and how that will stabilize close to 16, you mentioned.This quarter, the net take rate actually outperformed by a good amount, and I was just curious if there was any, you know, callouts to attribute that to or anything that, you know, we should expect to be stickier going forward or if it was maybe more of a mix shift. And then I'll just get my follow-up in there now. I know a bunch of people asked about Shopify Markets Pro and specifically, you know, kind of the international rollout. Is that something just from a timeline perspective, you know, be conservative, we should think about international markets there, you know, as a 2025-and-beyond-type of a discussion? Thanks a lot.Nir Debbi -- Co-Founder and PresidentIn terms of the international rollout, I think it's also dependent on Shopify plans. So, we can't commit or comment about it without being aligned with Shopify. But I do expect that if, in the coming quarters, we meet our targets, we will see additional markets being rolled in. When? I think it's much more a decision for Shopify to make.Matt O'Neill -- Financial Technology Partners -- AnalystUnderstood. And on the net take rate this quarter, anything to think about going forward or maybe some unique mix, elements that were idiosyncratic?Ofer Koren -- Chief Financial OfficerYeah. So, you know, as we previously stated, some of it is due to GMV mix. However, we do see, you know, a clear line of improvement over time, you know, due to, one, efficiencies, you know, different processes. We brought in -- we have a team, a very senior team that is going through the organization and mapping it for AI initiatives.I think that we've mentioned in the previous call that we had some very nice processes that are implemented that are already contributing, mainly around our service, but also in other areas. So, this is just an example. Another example is classification -- duty classification. And we do have quite a few initiatives, but it's not just AI initiatives, but also other processes and also economies of scale that we're pushing.So, over time, we do expect to see an improvement. However, as I mentioned, this -- the gross margin we had this quarter was high, and some of it was due to the specific revenue and GMV mix.OperatorThank you. There are no further questions at this time. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Amir Schlachet for final closing comments.Amir Schlachet -- Co-Founder and Chief Executive OfficerThank you very much, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today, and we very much look forward to seeing you again on our future earnings calls.

to amir  co founder and ceo amir schlachet    co founder and chief executive officerthank you  erica  and welcome  everyone  with the financial results of q1  which we are releasing today  we are off to a great start of what we believe will be yet another pivotal year of growth for global e  gmv  revenues  and adjusted ebitda will be at the top of our forecasted range for the quarter  with gmv growing 32  year on year  revenues growing 24   and adjusted ebitda growing 47   these strong results manifest our team s continued execution across all elements of the business  coupled with our effectiveness in controlling costs and the fact that macro conditions during the quarter were slightly more favorable than what we initially anticipated back in february moreover  we remain confident in our ability to uphold our plans for the remainder of the year  as is reflected in our updated guidance for the full year of 2024  most notably  the large client launches planned for the second half of the year are on track and shopify markets pro continues to amass merchants at the planned pace  among other things  we believe both these factors will contribute to our ability to accelerate growth in the second half of the year  later in this call  ofer will review our q1 results in more detail  and he will provide you with our guidance for q2 and our raised guidance for the full year of 2024 but before we do that  i would like to share with you some of the exciting business developments we have seen recently  during q1  we continue to experience strong demand for our services across all markets we operate in  q1 s so many renowned brands go live with global e services  in the u s   designer brands donna karan and dkny  footwear brand heydude by crocs  and sports fashion brand golf wang all went live  as did imperial workshop  our first u s merchant on the wix platform  thanks to the combination of wix and global e  all aspiring jedi knights can now do their essential lightsaber shopping online on the imperial workshop website  regardless of where they live  of course  as long as they    it s not in a galaxy far  far away  during the quarter  we also launched with lingerie brand la senza in canada  as well as high street fashion brand hobbs and t m lewin  luggage brand antler  and a homeware brand soho home in the u k  in europe  we launched with the french vintage style fashion brand louise misha  with fashion brands gerard darel  soeur  and caroll  and with the renowned luxury lifestyle brand repetto  which  thanks to global e  can now sell its iconic ballerina shoes worldwide as seamlessly and effectively as it does so in france  the quarter also saw the launches of innovative fashion brand marc cain and the online store of workwear and protective gear retailer engelbert strauss  both in germany  moreover  we launched with the leisure brand pacha in spain with its famous cherries logo  women s luxury fashion brand costarellos in greece  and the fashion brand rubato in sweden  among many others our business in apac continues to expand all the time as well  with examples of recent launches in the region being infamous swim and carla zampatti in australia  hi  mu mo by avex and commonsmart in japan  diy watch club in hong kong  and more  during q1  we also continued our efforts to expand our business with existing merchants and with brand groups  as such  we opened new markets for adidas and doen and went live with infiniment  an additional brand from the coty group  we also went live with tap to style  a new brand by modes in italy  who themselves just went live the previous quarter  and with nnormal  a new spanish brand from the camper group with dozens of other brands going live and with robust integration and sales pipelines  we believe we can continue on our growth path into the future as more and more merchants put emphasis on global direct to consumer sales  switching gears  i would like to update you regarding the various components of our strategic partnership with shopify  on the 3p or direct integration side  the migration of our historical merchant base onto the new native integration is nearing completion  and the team s focus has turned now toward the continued gradual transition of all shopify merchants onto checkout extensibility  on the 1p or shopify markets pro side  merchants continue to sign up and go live  gradually amassing gmv at the planned rate in parallel  the teams on both sides continue to work on developing additional features and capabilities  further enhancing the solutions  reach  given the large market potential on the shopify platform and as adoption of the innovative markets pro solution continues to rise  we remain highly convinced in our ability to capture a meaningful part of this massive market opportunity over the course of the next few years  with all these exciting developments and with many others across the entire business  we continue to believe more than ever in our ability to exhibit long term and durable growth as we capture more and more of the vast greenfield opportunity that lies ahead of us  i will now hand it to ofer  our cfo  to take us through the quarterly numbers in more depth  as well as present our updated guidance going forward ofer koren    chief financial officerthank you  amir  and thanks  everyone  for joining us today for our earnings call  we are off to a strong start in 2024  q1 was another quarter of fast growth and robust adjusted ebitda as we continue to drive progress on all fronts and remain committed to delivering value to merchants in their international initiatives  i d like to point out again that in addition to our gaap results  i ll also be discussing certain non gaap results our gaap financial results  along with the reconciliation between gaap and non gaap results  can be found in our earnings release  as amir mentioned  we have experienced rapid growth of gmv in q1 as we generated  930 million of gmv  an increase of 32  year over year  3 9  over the midpoint of our guidance for q1  we continue to benefit from the growth of global e commerce  which is back to its pre covid long term pattern  taking share from brick and mortar retail  and the continued focus of merchants on direct to consumer while there is still uncertainty regarding consumer demand  which remains volatile  in q1  we generated total revenue of  145 9 million  up 24  year over year  service fee revenue were  68 3 million  up 36   and fulfillment services revenue were up 15  to  77 6 million the higher growth of service fee revenue compared to fulfillment services revenue was mainly driven by the higher share of our multilocal offering  as reflected in our guidance  we expect take rates to stabilize at close to 16   driven by elevated levels of fulfillment services adoption  non gaap gross profit continued to outpace revenue growth  in q1  non gaap gross profit was  66 1 million  up 36  year over year  representing a gross margin of 45 3   compared to 41 4  in the same period last year  driven by the higher share of service fee revenue and our continuous efficiency efforts gaap gross profit was  63 3 million  representing a margin of 43 4   moving on to operational expenses  we continue to invest in the development of our platform to further enhance and expand our offering  r d expense in q4  excluding stock based compensation  was  20 1 million or 13 8  of revenue  compared to  16 9 million or 14 3  in the same period last year total r d spend in q4 was  23 5 million  we also continue to invest in sales and marketing to expand our pipeline while maintaining efficiencies  sales and marketing expense  excluding shopify related amortization expenses  stock based compensation  acquisition related intangibles amortization  was  17 2 million or 11 8  of revenue  compared to  10 5 million or 8 9  of revenue in the same period last year  shopify warrant related amortization expense was  36 3 million total sales and marketing expenses for the quarter were  57 million  general and administrative expenses  excluding stock based compensation  acquisition related expenses  and acquisition related contingent consideration  was  8 3 million or 5 7  of revenue  compared to  7 4 million or 6 3  of revenue in the same period last year  total g a spend in q1 was  12 1 million  adjusted ebitda continues to grow rapidly and totaled  21 3 million  representing a 14 6  adjusted ebitda margin and increasing by 47  from  14 5 million or 12 3  margin in the same period last year net loss was  32 1 million  compared to a net loss of  43 1 million in the year ago period  driven mainly by the amortization expenses related to the shopify warrants and by the transaction related intangibles  switching gears and turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statements  we ended the quarter with  298 million in cash  cash equivalents  including short term deposits and marketable securities  cash flow used by operating activities was  54 3 million  compared to  29 5 million used a year ago  driven by typical first quarter post peak working capital dynamics and a 12 2 million payment of held back acquisition related proceeds to the flow founders moving on to our financial outlook and guidance for q2 and our updated 2024 full year guidance  for q2 2024  we are expecting gmv to be in the range of  1 025 billion to  1 065 billion  at the midpoint of the range  this represents a growth rate of 27  versus q2 of 2023  we expect q2 revenue to be in the range of  162 5 million to  168 5 million at the midpoint of the range  this represents a growth rate of 24  versus q2 of 2023  for adjusted ebitda  we are expecting a profit in the range of  24 5 million to  28 5 million  for the full year of 2024  we are raising our guidance and now anticipate gmv to be in the range of  4 625 billion to  4 865 billion  representing a 33 4 annual growth rate at the midpoint of the range  revenue is now expected to be in the range of  733 million to  773 million  representing growth rate of 32 1  at the midpoint of the range for adjusted ebitda  we re now expecting a profit of  124 million to  140 million  we continue to believe growth will accelerate in the second half of the year  driven by large merchant launches planned for h2  which are on track  anticipated elevated volume contribution from shopify markets pro  which is growing as expected  and a lower impact from border free on a year on year comparison  in conclusion  the opportunity in front of us remains massive and we continue our journey to support merchants worldwide in expanding their direct to consumer business  we focus on execution and believe we can continue to grow rapidly while further expanding cash generation in the coming years and with that  amir  nir  and i are happy to answer questions you may have  operator questions   answers operatorthank you  ladies and gentlemen  we will now begin the question and answer session   operator instructions  our first question comes from the line of will nance from goldman sachs  go ahead  please will nance    goldman sachs    analysthey  guys  good morning  i appreciate you taking the question  i know you had a comment in the prepared remarks that the macro environment ended up being a little bit better than the expectations in the first quarter  and i m just wondering if you could kind of speak to what you re seeing so far in 2q just given some of the negative data points around luxury spending and  you know  is anything    have you guys noticed any change in spending patterns over the last month and a half amir schlachet    co founder and chief executive officerhey  will  thanks for the question  basically  we haven t seen any material changes in q2 so far  things continue to be volatile in terms of macro conditions we see it basically in the trading patterns  but our anticipation and what we ve seen so far in q2 and our assumption for the remainder of q2 is that the volatility and  hence  the macro environment  in general  will remain similar to what we ve seen in q1 will nance    goldman sachs    analystthat s super helpful  and then can you just talk about the pipeline of product enhancements on the markets pro side  things like fulfillment and just what the rollout schedule for things look    for things like that would be nir debbi    co founder and presidenthey  will  it s nir  we continue to work according to our road map  developing enhancements and features toward shopify markets pro  and we continue to roll those out  i think  over the next few quarters  we will see a gradual rollout of all the key elements we are working toward  and we expect that to continue and accelerate the growth in the coming quarters of the solutions adoption will nance    goldman sachs    analystgot it  i appreciate you taking the questions operatorthank you  our next question comes from the line of samad samana from jefferies  go ahead  please samad samana    jefferies    analysthi  good morning  thanks for taking my questions  so  maybe first  you guys mentioned multiple times that markets pro that the merchant ramp is tracking to plan can you just remind us what the planned target is  whether that s in terms of number of merchants or gmv that you re targeting for 2024 and what have you assumed in guidance for the rest of the year nir debbi    co founder and presidenthi  samad  we haven t guided for specific numbers of what we expect this year on markets pro  in the future  as we indicated before  once it becomes a large enough business lines  we will look at more clarity  specifically on markets pro  however  the market expectations  as reflected between different markets reports  is in line with what we see today so  we are trading within the numbers that are outside in the market samad samana    jefferies    analystunderstood  and then maybe just  ofer  as i think about the    i know you mentioned what drove the quarter  but i didn t catch nrr  could you maybe help us understand how nrr tracked through the quarter and what you ve observed maybe post quarter and if that s tracking to kind of historical assumptions that you ve seen over the last few years ofer koren    chief financial officeryeah  so  hey  samad  thanks for the question  so  as you know  we provide the annual ndr  nrr numbers however  generally speaking  we can say that while  as amir mentioned  there is volatility in consumer behavior  all in all  except for the lower two weeks in february  it has been around or just slightly below the numbers we usually see or the numbers we ve expected for this year  so  it s not at its peak and it s    it is below average  but it s more or less in line with what we ve expected for 2024 samad samana    jefferies    analystgreat  thanks again and congrats on a strong quarter ofer koren    chief financial officerthank you amir schlachet    co founder and chief executive officerthanks  samad operatorour next question comes from the line of brian peterson from raymond james  go ahead  please brian peterson    raymond james    analystthanks  gentlemen  and congrats on the quarter  so  i know you mentioned some commentary on the macro  i m curious how that relates to the top of the funnel  what are you seeing in terms of pipeline creation and deal timing thus far in 2024 nir debbi    co founder and presidenthey  hi  it s nir  thank you for the question for now  what we see as year to date is that our pipelines remain strong or even stronger than what we ve seen ever in the past  we are looking toward the second part of the year where we expect the launch of several large merchants that are currently in project state  as well as the signing of at least additional one  and so  we re quite optimistic  i don t think that we ever had a pipeline in terms of sheer dollars that is    that was as strong as this one brian peterson    raymond james    analystthat s great to hear  and  ofer  maybe just a follow up  you had a nice beat in gross margins this quarter  i know the mix is maybe a little bit different  but want to understand what drove that and how we should be thinking about modeling gross margins going forward  thanks  guys ofer koren    chief financial officerthat    so  yeah  gross margins have been high this quarter  and that is due to two factors  the first one is actually the mix of revenue  so  service fee share was higher compared to last year  to the parallel quarter  and in addition  we are continuously working on efficiencies  improving processes  and so on and so forth so  this contributed as well  going forward  we don t expect    as we previously stated  we don t expect any significant expansion this year  we are happy with the level of gross margins we currently have  so  going forward  we do not expect a significant increase operatorthank you  our next question comes from the line of koji ikeda from bank of america  go ahead  please koji ikeda    bank of america merrill lynch    analystyeah  hey  guys  thanks so much for taking the questions  i wanted to ask on the guidance here  just thinking about the gmv guidance specifically and when i look at the second quarter guide and the full quarter guide and a little bit of the historical seasonal pattern in gmv  it looks like a pretty heavy ramp into the fourth quarter here  so  just trying to understand or maybe a bit more qualitative color in the way you re thinking about linearity in gmv ramp for the rest of the year  thank you ofer koren    chief financial officeryeah  so  you re right  this year is not our typical year  and we ve discussed that in the previous quarter as well  h2 growth takes into account few drivers  the first one is the large client launches that we expect and currently are on track  on time so  this is one main contributor  in previous years  we had large client launches  but they were not all in the second half of the year  the second driver is obviously shopify markets pro  which is ramping up  so  we expect it to contribute more in h2 and it is currently    as we mentioned  it s on target  so we feel quite confident with the way it s progressing  the third one is we do expect to see reduced effect of border free    border free is weighing on our growth a bit due to the nature of the merchants trading on border free  a lot of large department stores and so on  and as we go forward  one  its share of our volume is decreasing because the other business is growing  and we are migrating those merchants to global e and we expect to see uplifts once those migrations are done  so  those are the main drivers behind the h2 growth koji ikeda    bank of america merrill lynch    analystgot it  thank you  and just a follow up here on the large merchants that you ve mentioned that you re expecting to come on in the second half  it definitely sounds like it s a positive and on the progression here to get them to go live  but it also sounds like it s a pretty big risk to guidance if they don t go live so  maybe you could speak to what is giving you that confidence that these guys will be able to get the global e platform live later this year  thanks  guys nir debbi    co founder and presidenthi  koji  it s nir  the large projects are currently on track  it s projects that are already deep into the project phase of it in order to launch in q3 and early q4 because no one launches in november  december usually  everybody is doing it pre peak  so  in the next four months  in order to launch  large merchants are already deep into the integration and the testing cycle  so  we do have high confidence that it is happening  while there is always a risk of delay  we do have a high level of confidence  based on the current status of the project  that it s actually going to go as planned so  as we do take some  i would say  some level of conservatism into our guidance    on our guidance  of course  we do have    we did factor out certain delays  a few weeks here  a few weeks there  in order to absorb minor changes in the launches koji ikeda    bank of america merrill lynch    analystthank you  thank you for taking the questions amir schlachet    co founder and chief executive officerthanks  koji operatorour next question comes from the line of scott berg from needham  go ahead  please scott berg    needham and company    analysthi  everyone  nice quarter  thanks for taking my questions  nir  i think it was you that responded to the pipeline question in the second half and pleased that  actually  i think it was  dollar wise  might be an all time high here as you look back at your q1 business  how are    what do sales cycles look like  are you able to continue to close deals at similar rates or is there anything in the back row that might be accelerating or delaying some of those sales cycles nir debbi    co founder and presidentyeah  so  to be honest  i think after  i ll say  a slight delay sometime in mid half last year  as of  i would say  late last year or this q1  we are more optimistic that merchants are  i would say  starting to see light at the end of the tunnel and we see willing to make commitments faster  the main change we see is on the larger project side where we see more rfps coming in and more interest from large merchants  and if that continues  we do expect it to affect very positively our 2025 launches so  it s pipelines that is being built now  very strong one  and we believe that if this continues along the year  it    we will see a very positive effect on our 2025 business scott berg    needham and company    analystgot it  very helpful  thank you  and then as you all look at six months into the markets pro opportunity with shopify  you seem pleased with the current traction  at least year to date  and what the second half looks like but are there additional levers that you believe that you can pull  maybe they don t impact this year  maybe it s more impacting next year in fiscal  25  but are there additional levers that you can pull to maybe accelerate some of the merchant adoption of that platform amir schlachet    co founder and chief executive officeryeah  thanks  scott  it s amir  so  as you said and as we noted  we re  indeed  pleased with the pace in which merchants are onboarding and that gmv is amassing and yes  there is a joint pipeline and road map between us and shopify  which is aimed at constantly adding more features and enhancing the solution  which  by itself  should enlarge the applicability of the solutions for additional merchants and accelerate down the line  as you indicated  into next year and beyond  the pace in which it is adopted  in addition  as a reminder  this markets pro is currently available just for u s  based merchants  again  as part of our road map into the future  we do also plan  together with shopify  down the line to open the markets pro offering for merchants from additional markets like the u k  and others that s still    there s no date yet set  it s still in the future  but when that goes online  it will further accelerate the adoption rate scott berg    needham and company    analystunderstood  very helpful  thanks and congrats again on a good quarter amir schlachet    co founder and chief executive officerthanks  scott operatorour next question comes from the line of james faucette from morgan stanley  go ahead  please james faucette    morgan stanley    analystgreat  thank you  i wanted to ask just a couple of follow up questions  first  in terms of your existing customers  i know you said that the nrr was kind of moving around and wasn t quite as strong as it has been historically but can you give us a little color on how the same store sales component of that is tracking and if you ve made any adjustments to how that s being incorporated into your outlook for this year ofer koren    chief financial officersure  thank you for that  james  it s ofer  so  i was referring previously mainly to that component the same store sales has been lower than the historical average  and it has been volatile  however  we see sort of stabilizing around the levels that we ve assumed or used for our budget  so  it s    you know  there was a drop in mid february that we talked about in the previous quarter  then it came back  and since then  it is sort of hovering around the same levels with some volatility james faucette    morgan stanley    analystgreat  appreciate that  and then when    back on  you know  shopify and shopify markets pro  can    you know  it sounds like that that s continuing to track well  if you can give us a little more insight into how that develops sequentially  and then  you know  clearly  you re doing a lot to add incremental functionality is    i guess the    with the comment that that ll increase the applicability  is that built into the acceleration you re expecting in the latter part of this year or is    should we think about there being more of a lag and there being more of an impact in trajectory in  25  thanks amir schlachet    co founder and chief executive officeryeah  thanks  james  so  in terms of the adoption rate  we see a constant stream of merchants that is joining  and it s    we re constantly working  not just on features that have to do with the offering itself  but also the onboarding process  which is not less important  and making it even more seamless and even faster for merchants to onboard and start trading  so  this  together with the larger appeal as we roll down    or roll out more features  should gradually enhance that kind of daily or weekly pace of merchants joining the platform so  we do bake into our assumptions going forward the kind of gradual increase in that pace when we look on a longer term  but also taking into account that these are all new merchants  so  as the year progresses  we should get    it should get increasingly meaningful because we get more and more of these merchants to trade in parallel on the platform operatorthank you  our next question comes from the line of brent bracelin from piper sandler  go ahead  please brent bracelin    piper sandler    analystthank you  so  sounds like the large merchants here are helping drive this second half acceleration  it sounds like you re getting more interest from large merchants in the pipeline  i just wanted to double click into why now could you talk about why these large merchants are now turning to global e  the tough macro out there  there are certainly challenges  so  i d love to better explain kind of why you re seeing the large markets turn to global e now  thanks nir debbi    co founder and presidenthi  brent  it s nir  then  overall  we have seen a movement toward larger merchants that started in covid  covid pushed much more larger retailers toward accelerating the direct to consumer approach  especially on a global level  as most of them had it in their home markets and we do see this being accelerated now with more rfps coming out as domestic markets  i assume  are more challenging or more saturated for many of them and they do want to have further growth and further profitability that can be provided by direct to consumer and not through wholesale or middlemen in different countries around the world  so  we do expect it to continue to grow  and i think it also relates to global e s positioning that  over time  builds much more expertise and brand position as market leader in supporting those large brands generating great results and making their operations much more seamless and simple trading around the world  and we continue to see this growing and accelerating over time as we re able to build more capabilities  being much more localized in more markets around the world  and gain and generate more data out of this growth so  the combination of it all  i think  creates this flywheel effect that would continue to attract larger business into the company as we see it brent bracelin    piper sandler    analystnir  thanks for that  and then  ofer  if i think about the gmv growth guide at the midpoint versus the revenue guide at the midpoint  can you just talk a little bit about take rate and expectations on take rate and what s driving the improvement here in q2 ofer koren    chief financial officeryeah  so  basically  as we mentioned previously  we expect    while we do expect some volatility in take rates  depending on specific gmv mix  we expect it to be much more stable  if you look at the entire year compared to previous years  we expect it to be close to 16  over the year  with less volatility between quarters  as we ve mentioned  we do see multilocal growth normalizing  not because they re    those merchants are not growing they re growing very nicely  but last year  they either    that the larger of those either expanded their business with us or launched the business with us  so it was a unique year in that perspective  so  we see more normalized take rates  there aren t many changes it s mainly sort of marginal movement  depending on the gmv mix  but we do expect it to stabilize below 16  brent bracelin    piper sandler    analystmakes sense  thank you so much amir schlachet    co founder and chief executive officerthanks  brent operatorour next question comes from the line of andrew bauch from wells fargo  go ahead  please andrew bauch    wells fargo securities    analysthey  good morning  thanks for taking the question  i just wanted to get a product update on the demand gen solution that you were planning to launch in the second half i mean  maybe an update on  you know  early receptiveness you ve heard from clients and whether that can meaningfully move the needle on revenues or margins as we get in the back half of the year nir debbi    co founder and presidenthi  thank you for the question  it s nir  we continue to invest in building our demand gen capabilities we did  over the last few quarters  build expertise and an in house specialized agency to support our brands in growing their demand generation  in the second part of the year  we are going to launch to support it based on the border free acquisition  a unique proposition that would support us in driving our brands  growth  we are now in the early stages of introducing this solution to our merchants  it s not live for them yet it s just being introduced to them now in order to get the buy in  in order to get them live on it in the second part of the year  we do see a very great interest in it  and we do expect high adoption  we do believe it will accelerate the growth  and we will start seeing positive effect as of the last quarter of the year  but much more when we look into 2025 onwards  this does    going to  as we see it  accelerate our growth and our client s growth  based on actually increasing ndr we expect that trading merchants today and merchants that will launch with us in the future would be able to penetrate new markets and increase their footfall in current markets with these services  so  we do have high hopes to it  most of it will not materialize  of course  in 2024  we do see it as a contribution that s going to grow as of 2025 onwards andrew bauch    wells fargo securities    analystthat s definitely something to look forward to  just touching on adjusted ebitda  you know  another nice quarter of stability there  just thinking about the back half ramp with markets pro and with the two large merchants  how do you feel from an investment perspective that you re positioned today and how do you think that that can translate to margins as we get in the back half of this year and then into 2025  just trying to better understand the modeling here ofer koren    chief financial officerso  ebitda  you know  as reflected in our guidance  we expect the margin to grow    to continue to grow in 2024 and to be around 18   the economics of  you know  new merchants coming in or the shopify markets pro offering  you know  obviously  if those are large merchants  the economics are a bit different  but on the same level  we ve launched many smaller merchants in the first half of the year  so  there is a balance there we don t expect any significant changes  we expect to see an improvement over time  as reflected in our guidance  for the entire year as well amir schlachet    co founder and chief executive officeryeah  and it s amir  i ll just add maybe that we do    we ve spoken a couple of times in the past and also in this call  we strongly believe that there s a huge greenfield opportunity still ahead of us  so  we do    it s important to note that we do still prioritize growth over profitability so  whenever we see and we continue to see all the time opportunities to reinvest in the business  of course  always watching our operational expenses growth and making sure that we continue to gradually improve on margins  but still  we continue to invest in adding more resources on    both on the r d side and across the rest of the business  to make sure that we continue to be well positioned to capture this opportunity operatorthank you  our next question comes from the line of pat walravens from jmp  please go ahead pat walravens    jmp securities    analystgreat  thank you  so  amir  big picture  you have all these growth drivers  you ve got shopify you can go more in the u s   then you can go internationally  you just launched with wix  you re adding more bigger brands  you have the demand gen solution coming out so  the question is what are the constraints on the ability of this company to scale  you know  you re going to do a billion next year  why can t it grow to 10 billion amir schlachet    co founder and chief executive officeri don t think we can t  i think we can  pat  i think it s    the opportunity is there  i think our product market fit is there i think we have  in the pipeline  also additional complementary services that we can add  so  all of that together  i think we re on the right path to continue growing  we are also constantly working on enlarging our already significant ecosystem of great partners around us where they can contribute to our growth and we can contribute to their growth  so  i think the main constraints are time and  of course  as always  execution and we continue to focus on execution  we continue to make sure that we do the best job possible for the growth of our merchants  and we believe that as we continue to do so  growth will continue to come and we can continue to materialize that opportunity ahead of us pat walravens    jmp securities    analystawesome  all right  and i m looking forward to seeing you guys on wednesday in tel aviv  so  congratulations amir schlachet    co founder and chief executive officersame here  thanks  pat operatorour next question comes from the line of maddie schrage from keybanc capital markets  please go ahead maddie schrage    keybanc capital markets    analysthey  guys  and thank you for taking my question  i was just wondering if you can give an update on the border free migration  just kind of wondering maybe what percentage of customers have moved over to the global e platform and kind of any early learnings on that uplift that you could potentially see there  thanks nir debbi    co founder and presidentwe do continue to work with the clients toward migration to end by the end of this year or latest  if we see there is a need for it  early q1 next year  the clients that have migrated  we have seen great results in uplifting the sales conversion rates  driving better performance  better sales  based on the  i would say  a larger suite of solutions and services on our platform  we do expect that once the vast majority of border free clients would migrate  we will see a better trading with them in the following quarter    in the following quarters  so  we are optimistic about it it is  as we indicated in the past  going slower than initially expected  so we do believe that some of it will roll out into q1 of next year  however  we are happy with the results that we have seen on migrated clients maddie schrage    keybanc capital markets    analystgreat  and then just a quick follow up  do you have any callouts from maybe a geo perspective  are there any standouts in terms of inbound markets  either headwinds or tailwinds  thanks nir debbi    co founder and presidenti think that we constantly see different changes in different markets around the world in terms of inbound volumes  as some countries face more challenging macro  you see their growth declining  some of it    some of the markets are affected by geopolitics  if you look at the inbound into israel or ukraine  where you see the markets actually shrinking in two digit percentage pace heavily but because of our global nature and the amount of corridors we sell into  as    and actually  i think that  all in all  as ofer indicated  we do see some stability  so  the overall numbers are slightly below historical averages  but they are in line with what we expected for this year  which was  i would say  a bit softer macro  in general  than previous years  despite the fact that  yes  there is volatility  some weeks looks better or less  but overall  i think that we do see now a stable  relatively ok macro  not as great as in previous years  but i would say an ok macro  in general  reflected in same store sales across different corridors operatorthank you  our next question comes from the line of mark zgutowicz from the benchmark company  go ahead  please mark zgutowicz    the benchmark company    analystthank you  hi  guys  just a question around the onboarding process for markets pro merchants  i know there s been some progress made there i m just curious  in terms of  you know  lifting the friction there  are those capabilities now in place or are there still more enhancements that may accelerate the onboarding of u s  merchants  and then is this the key variable in terms of moving markets pro outside the u s  with shopify  thanks nir debbi    co founder and presidentyeah  thank you for the question  it s nir  we do continue to roll out features and process alignments in order to make the onboarding quicker  more seamless  and to gain a great    even better results out of the gate however  also on the ongoing trading and the market segments and vertical that the solution is geared for  we do have still a rollout plan of different features and capabilities that will be rolled out through the coming quarters  on the back of this completion  of course  we would go into a much wider rollout  but this is dependent  of course  on shopify and their decisions  but we are fully aligned on the road map ahead and what we need to achieve in the coming quarters in order to continue with the rollout mark zgutowicz    the benchmark company    analystthanks  nir  that s helpful  and then one quick one for ofer  possibly  on luxury  just curious how that segment is pacing first half versus    or just year over year    first half year over year  thanks ofer koren    chief financial officeryes  so  regarding luxury  2023 was not a good year for luxury  as we discussed several times  and since then  we ve seen it sort of stabilizing and coming back to growth  not very strong growth  but after the lows that we have seen during some of the quarters  mainly  i think  it was in q3 last year  it has stabilized and gone back to growth  maybe not growing as fast as other segments  but positive growth operatorthank you  our next question comes from the line of matt coad from autonomous research  go ahead  please matt coad    autonomous research    analysthi  hey  guys  thanks for taking the question  i m curious if you could unpack the growth in sales and marketing expenses  ex the warrant amortization  sorry about that it s growing at a really fast pace  as you noted in your prepared remarks  just curious  is a lot of this growth coming mainly from shopify s revenue share  or are there changes to your go to market approach that we should be aware of  thanks ofer koren    chief financial officersure  so  as you mentioned  we do have sort of a variable cost in our sales and marketing  which is the shopify rev share component  and it is growing  so  i think most of the growth in expenses or the    not most of the growth  but most of the extra growth is due to shopify rev share expenses  however  nothing special to report  but we are  you know  continuously expanding our sales force it s a gradual expansion  but  you know  as we grow  we are bringing in more people  but not anything out of the ordinary operatorthank you  we will take our last question from the line of matt o neill from ft partners  go ahead  please matt o neill    financial technology partners    analysthey  gentlemen  thanks so much for squeezing me in at the end  a lot of good questions were asked and answered  maybe first  ofer  i know you mentioned a couple of points contributing to the growth in take rate and how that will stabilize close to 16  you mentioned this quarter  the net take rate actually outperformed by a good amount  and i was just curious if there was any  you know  callouts to attribute that to or anything that  you know  we should expect to be stickier going forward or if it was maybe more of a mix shift  and then i ll just get my follow up in there now  i know a bunch of people asked about shopify markets pro and specifically  you know  kind of the international rollout  is that something just from a timeline perspective  you know  be conservative  we should think about international markets there  you know  as a 2025 and beyond type of a discussion  thanks a lot nir debbi    co founder and presidentin terms of the international rollout  i think it s also dependent on shopify plans  so  we can t commit or comment about it without being aligned with shopify  but i do expect that if  in the coming quarters  we meet our targets  we will see additional markets being rolled in  when  i think it s much more a decision for shopify to make matt o neill    financial technology partners    analystunderstood  and on the net take rate this quarter  anything to think about going forward or maybe some unique mix  elements that were idiosyncratic ofer koren    chief financial officeryeah  so  you know  as we previously stated  some of it is due to gmv mix  however  we do see  you know  a clear line of improvement over time  you know  due to  one  efficiencies  you know  different processes  we brought in    we have a team  a very senior team that is going through the organization and mapping it for ai initiatives i think that we ve mentioned in the previous call that we had some very nice processes that are implemented that are already contributing  mainly around our service  but also in other areas  so  this is just an example  another example is classification    duty classification  and we do have quite a few initiatives  but it s not just ai initiatives  but also other processes and also economies of scale that we re pushing so  over time  we do expect to see an improvement  however  as i mentioned  this    the gross margin we had this quarter was high  and some of it was due to the specific revenue and gmv mix operatorthank you  there are no further questions at this time  i d now like to turn the call back over to mr  amir schlachet for final closing comments amir schlachet    co founder and chief executive officerthank you very much  and thank you  everyone  for joining us today  and we very much look forward to seeing you again on our future earnings calls  just before we adjourn  i would like to take this opportunity again to say a big

                        "Volatility in the stock of e-commerce software company Shopify (NYSE: SHOP) has struck again. Investors seem to be fretting over two things: a slowdown in revenue growth predictions for the spring 2024 quarter and the company's inability to sustain net profitability per generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).Under the surface, though, Shopify might be a great buy-the-dip candidate. Here's why.Playing the long game in generating profitAs a reminder, Shopify reports its business in two primary segments: subscription solutions (the base website design and management software tools) and merchant solutions (value-added services like digital payments acceptance and shipping).Last year, Shopify sold off its low-profit-margin in-house logistics and merchandise warehousing segment (previously part of the merchant solutions segment), which is creating a bit of a drag on reported year-over-year revenue growth.Shopify Revenue SegmentQ1 2024 RevenueYear-Over-Year GrowthSubscription solutions$511 million34%Merchant solutions$1.35 billion20%Total$1.86 billion23% (29% excluding logistics sale)Data source: Shopify.Now that Shopify is focused on higher-profit software again, much investor attention has shifted to the bottom line. And in this department, Shopify continues to create angst for some shareholders. That's because net income, which had made progress in 2023, shifted to a net loss in Q1 2024.SHOP Net Income (Quarterly) ChartAgain, as I discussed a number of times last year, GAAP-based net income is a very messy metric by which to measure Shopify's financial performance at this stage of its life.For one thing, quarter-to-quarter stock returns have an outsize impact on net income and loss, because Shopify owns sizable stakes in e-commerce software partners Global-e Online (NASDAQ: GLBE), Affirm Holdings (NASDAQ: AFRM), and Klaviyo (NYSE: KVYO). At the end of March 2024, the value of these holdings was $1.89 billion, down from $2.23 billion three months prior, because all three stocks performed poorly in the first quarter.GLBE ChartBy contrast, GAAP income from operations (which excludes quarterly unrealized investment gains and losses as well as a bit of interest income from the $5.18 billion in cash and short-term investments Shopify had on balance) actually produced a small profit of $86 million to kick off 2024.Is the valuation \"cheap\" yet?OK, on to the free cash flow (FCF) metric, which gives a much better picture of where Shopify is right now, especially now that the logistics business is gone. Management was proud to announce FCF was $232 million, making for a 12% FCF profit margin, double the 6% of Q1 2023.Story continuesFor a software company, an FCF margin of 12% is quite slim. A healthy margin will be 20% at minimum. There's still tremendous room for improvement in the years ahead as the business matures, though. This is still very much a company concerned with growth.And growing it is. Though investors were also a bit concerned with the Q2 outlook for a rate of revenue growth that's only in the low 20s (when the effects of the offloaded logistics business are excluded), this is still a solid projection. If Shopify can dial FCF profit margins higher this year (say to 15% or so), we're looking at a business headed for $8.5 billion in revenue and FCF of $1.3 billion this year.To be clear, that puts a premium valuation of about 77 times this year's expected FCF (my estimate) on Shopify. It isn't cheap by traditional measures. But I also still rank Shopify as a fairly young software company with the potential to grow revenue at 20% for years to come. If profit margins keep improving along the way, all the better.Perhaps Shopify isn't the timeliest of buys right now, even after the post-Q1 earnings update dip. Other e-commerce stocks, like Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), are delivering profitability gains. That said, given its steady progress, I'm more than happy to continue holding on to my stake in Shopify.Should you invest $1,000 in Shopify right now?Before you buy stock in Shopify, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Shopify wasn’t one of them.

  this is still a solid projection  if shopify can dial fcf profit margins higher this year  say to 15  or so   we re looking at a business headed for  8 5 billion in revenue and fcf of  1 3 billion this year to be clear  that puts a premium valuation of about 77 times this year s expected fcf  my estimate  on shopify  it isn t cheap by traditional measures  but i also still rank shopify as a fairly young software company with the potential to grow revenue at 20  for years to come  if profit margins keep improving along the way  all the better perhaps shopify isn t the timeliest of buys right now  even after the post q1 earnings update dip  other e commerce stocks  like amazon  nasdaq  amzn   are delivering profitability gains  that said  given its steady progress  i m more than

                        "It's been a tough few years for investors in the Ark Innovation ETF. Since its value peaked at $158 per share in early 2021, the exchange-traded fund (ETF) is down 73%. However, that is just one of the ETF offerings from Cathie Wood's investment management firm. Another has delivered much better results: the ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (NYSEMKT: ARKF).Since the start of 2023, the Ark Innovation Fintech ETF jumped in value by 87%, outpacing Wood's flagship ETF, which is up 36% over the same period. It also outpaced the Nasdaq Composite index (up 71%) and the S&P 500 (up 40%).The ETF holds several fintech stocks, but there are four that represent the fund's largest positions and together make up almost of third of the portfolio. They are:1. Coinbase Global (11.6% of the ETF's portfolio)Coinbase Global (NASDAQ: COIN) operates one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world. It's positioned to act as an easy on-ramp for people looking to buy or sell Bitcoin or any of the other 250 cryptocurrencies it lists.The company is heavily involved in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, providing infrastructure for on-chain activities, including digital wallets, decentralized apps, and other engagement platforms.Coinbase's growth is strongly linked to trading activity in the cryptocurrency markets. In 2021, the market capitalization for cryptocurrencies surged as retail and institutional investors piled into the asset class, and the company recorded revenue of $7.8 billion. However, in each of the past two years, its revenue was less than half that amount.Things have gotten off to a good start for Coinbase this year. Its first-quarter results were stellar as revenue grew by 187% year over year, driven by solid transaction volume, new user growth, and higher average trading volume per user.The company will continue to focus on expanding revenue through transaction volume and its stablecoin and will work to gain further regulatory clarity, which should clear up uncertainty surrounding the industry.2. Shopify (7.7% of the ETF's portfolio)Shopify (NYSE: SHOP) is a crucial player among retailers (especially those with e-commerce needs), offering a platform and an array of services that make it easy for businesses of any size to open and run shops (especially online shops). Its platform is simple to use and also provides numerous features, including product management, inventory tracking, and payment processing, making store management seamless.The company's top-line growth is stellar. Over the past five years, revenue went from $1.58 billion to $7 billion -- a compound annual growth rate of 35%. Its bottom-line results, however, were more uneven. Earnings surged in 2021 as e-commerce activity skyrocketed during the pandemic. But in 2022, Shopify posted losses of nearly $3.5 billion. Last year, cost-cutting measures helped it get back in the black with a net profit of $132 million.Story continuesShopify is well-positioned in an ever-expanding industry. According to a forecast from Boston Consulting Group, e-commerce sales will grow at a compound annual rate of 9% through 2027, when they are projected to comprise 41% of global retail sales, up from 18% in 2017.3. Block (7.2% of the ETF's portfolio)Block's (NYSE: SQ) earliest product, the Square point-of-sales system, made it simple for small and medium-sized businesses to process digital and card payments and manage sales. Its system replaced bulky hardware, and empowered small businesses to accept payments easily using smartphones and tablets.Its Cash App simplified peer-to-peer payments, making sending and receiving money easy. Since then, that app has grown into a full-fledged financial services platform, allowing people to bank, invest, and hold cryptocurrencies in a single place. The Cash App also holds the advantage of being the most used investing app across all generations, according to The Motley Fool's Generational Investing Tools survey.Block is in the midst of a transformational year. CEO Jack Dorsey is looking to streamline the business and improve the synergies of the company's offerings: Square, Cash App, and Afterpay, its \"buy now, pay later\" (BNPL) service. The company also plans to invest heavily in Bitcoin, linking its longer-term success to the future of the cryptocurrency.4. Robinhood Markets (4.9% of the ETF's portfolio)Robinhood Markets (NASDAQ: HOOD) aims to democratize investing for all, but in its efforts to do so, it generated its share of criticism for how it did so (including concerns about the gamification of stock trading). However, there's no denying it has been one of the most innovative companies in the brokerage space over the past decade. The company popularized features like commission-free trading, fractional share trading, and a user-friendly interface.Robinhood's early growth was impressive, but it has slowed down in the years following the meme-stock-fueled trading frenzy of 2021. The company is taking steps to reignite growth, including offering high yields on uninvested cash to its Robinhood Gold members, and retirement accounts with matching to bring more funds onto the platform.In 2024, the company posted its best quarterly results since going public. That improvement came from a growing asset base, robust transaction volumes, higher net interest income, and growing subscription revenue. Robinhood will continue to lean into its subscription business and retirement accounts to attract more funds to its platform, and, like Coinbase, seeks more clarity on its cryptocurrency business from regulators.Should you invest $1,000 in Coinbase Global right now?Before you buy stock in Coinbase Global, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Coinbase Global wasn’t one of them.

                        "Shopify (SHOP) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this cloud-based commerce company have returned -22.8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.2% change. The Zacks Internet - Services industry, to which Shopify belongs, has gained 2.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Shopify is expected to post earnings of $0.21 per share, indicating a change of +50% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $0.96 points to a change of +29.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.28 indicates a change of +33.8% from what Shopify is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.1%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Shopify.Story continuesThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for SHOP _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Shopify, the consensus sales estimate of $2 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +18.2%. The $8.51 billion and $10.15 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +20.6% and +19.3%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryShopify reported revenues of $1.86 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +23.4%. EPS of $0.20 for the same period compares with $0.01 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.84 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.36%. The EPS surprise was +25%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Shopify is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Shopify. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

company s business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change  there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy and hold decision earnings estimate revisionsrather than focusing on anything else  we at zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company s earnings projection  this is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings we essentially look at how sell side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends  and if earnings estimates go up for a company  the fair value for its stock goes up  a higher fair value than the current market price drives investors  interest in buying the stock  leading to its price moving higher  this is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements for

                        "As the world’s largest companies scramble to tackle the impacts of climate change, Big Tech is betting on a surprisingly low-tech solution to reach their net-zero goal. Enhanced rock weathering already happens naturally over thousands of years, but startup Lithos Carbon is accelerating the process, spreading leftover rock dust across farm fields.The company is scaling its operation with financial backing from Frontier, a consortium of investors that include Meta (META), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and JPMorgan (JPM). The climate fund, led by payments processing company Stripe, committed $57.1 million to Lithos Carbon last year to remove over 154,000 tons of carbon.Lithos Carbon is one of hundreds of startups globally that are competing in a carbon removal industry expected to reach $135 billion by 2040, according to consulting firm BCG.Once considered a workaround for critical emission-cutting work, carbon removal technologies, which extract and sequester carbon dioxide emissions from the atmosphere, are increasingly seen as a necessary step to capping global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2050, as laid out in the Paris Agreement.The UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has said the world needs to remove up to 10 billion tons of carbon per year by the middle of the century to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.Roughly 2,400 companies have disclosed having net-zero targets in place, according to nonprofit group CDP. Many of those firms are turning to carbon removal technologies to offset emissions, as they realize that emissions reductions alone won’t get them within their net-zero goals. Demand for carbon credits is projected to quadruple from 2030 to 2040, according to BCG.Big Tech firms are among the biggest buyers of carbon removal credits. Microsoft (MSFT), the leading buyer globally, has purchased more than 7.6 million carbon credits, since 2020 according to online tracker CDR.fyi.If you’re going to future-proof your portfolio, you need to know what’s NEXT.

TranscriptSo the first thing we're gonna do is turn our spinner blades on.You can already see a streak where we've already spread out there.Rick Bennett is a third generation farmer trying his hand at a new type of fertilizer crossed volcanic rock known as the salt.Story continuesThe rock dust is considered waste but one start up is finding new use for it to tackle a climate crisis.Workers here affectionately call this Brown Mountain lithos carbon considers it gold.This material is what's chemically reacting with carbon dioxide to permanently capture and sequester it into a form that takes it out of the atmosphere.It's a process that happens naturally over thousands of years.Lithos carbon is spreading it on farms to accelerate it to two years backed by a $57 million investment from frontier, a consortium of companies that includes Meta and JP Morgan.There are some portions of company emissions that you will just never abate.Recognizing that they have a net zero target and they want to actually get to zero and honor very public commitments.They have to invest in some sort of removal.Technology scientists say it's not enough to reduce carbon emissions but capture them with co 21 of the leading causes of climate change, which is why hundreds of companies are pouring into the carbon removal space.The question is, which can scale up quickly cheaply with the future of our environment at stake.This is what's next in carbon removal.We've got drill rigs prepping for the next shot.We've got blasters in here, loading for a shot.This quarry is so busy.Uh, we blast a couple times a week out here and that could drop 50 to 60,000 tons of rock at a time onto the ground.How far down are we?Right now?We're about 100 ft down in this active pit state of North Carolina.We can mine down to 500 ft deep.So we're gonna be here a very long time mining.The, this fight against climate change begins with one of the most abundant resources on the planet.Basalt has long been considered the building blocks used in asphalt and concrete.Some rock quarry in North Carolina has so much of it.It ships out millions of tons every year.We take that 36 inch boulder and we crush it down to sand size particles that we can put in the asphalt and concrete.And from that surge pile, it'll get crushed again, it'll get screened, it'll get washed and it'll kind of continue on that process until it gets to a final product size.And spec and stockpiled.Some rock uses every piece of that rock except the dust of waste that piles up in the end.This is the secret.This is what we looked all over the country for.Is this this particular material?Not all the salt is quality that lithos wants.Can you tell by just looking at it or do you actually have to?You can't.Yeah.So if we look at it under an electron microscope, we're looking at all the properties that make it suitable for the carbon capture process and also release the nutrients that helps the soil and the plants grow in it as well.It's part of a process called enhanced rock weathering, carbon dioxide in the atmosphere combines with rainwater to create a weak form of acid rain that rain hits volcanic rocks.It leads to a chemical reaction that traps CO2.It's a natural process that takes thousands of years.Lithos carbon is speeding that up more than 1000 times by spreading the finest form of rock dust across farm fields.The thinking is the more surface area, the rocks cover, the more carbon is captured.Li says all of the rain combined with the salt also helps improve crop yields.Farms are extra special and extra powerful for a few reasons.One the roots, they break up the rock dust faster.So that's great to the farmers already need to spread rock dust in their field.They need to do this to rehabilitate their soils.After we use synthetic fertilizer, the farmers, they're already spreading rock that we're actually replacing something they already do today with something that works even better.So it's plugging into existing infrastructure piggy backing on that and allowing us to scale this climate crisis faster.So the drill goes in, it pulls the dirt right up into the bucket.The soil is manually tested every two acres every six months to measure the amount of carbon captured enhanced rock weathering is one of many solutions in a growing industry with demand projected to quadruple from 2030 to 2040.According to consulting firm BC G, there are already more than 220 carbon removal companies globally.There's multiple different pathways, chemical pathways for which you can take co two out of air and no one really knows for sure yet, which ones are going to be able to scale the fastest and come down the price curve most effectively.And so it really starts to become a complicated puzzle of which technologies work in the right atmospheres or in the right uh environments to optimize all of this.And we need some of all of them.This satellite image of carbon in the atmosphere points to the scale of the problem.Humans have dumped two trillion tons of CO2 into the air, pushing global temperatures more than two degrees above pre industrial levels.The UN panel on climate change says we need to remove up to 10 billion tons per year by 2050.To avoid the worst impacts of climate change, that amounts to roughly 25% of annual carbon emissions today, that many of those emissions will be eliminated through various reduction measures.So more efficient Motors, cleaner Power, et cetera, but there is still a large amount of emissions that ultimately will have to be taken out of the atmosphere in some way if we want to get to net zero, that's where carbon removal comes in.Even with all of the efforts to decarbonize bcgs.Current mystery estimates, companies will still fall more than 30% short of their goal to be truly net zero.That means they'll need to buy carbon credits from companies like lithos to offset emissions they can't reduce on their own.I think all of these sort of front runners in the carbon market, they're not just interested in what they can buy today.They're investing in the future of the carbon di remo market, the scale of the problem they recognize that investment is needed.So they are looking to kind of support pathways.There are a lot of ways to remove carbon, but there's a trade off between affordability and reliability.Direct air capture has the simplest measuring system, but it requires building large factories that can suck co2 out of the air.It costs up to $1000 to capture a ton of carbon methods that rely on agricultural waste are considered cheaper, but it requires a lot of land enhanced rock weathering uses a smaller footprint.But critics say there's too much uncertainty.There isn't enough data to show how effective the process is planting trees may be economical.But Mire says the carbon storage isn't as permanent precise measurements are harder to come by.You can estimate how much carbon is in the tree.But there are questions like what happens if it gets cut down?What happens if there's a forest fire.And so in all of these technologies, they all have various pros and cons.But in general, the higher quality ones or the higher durability ones are the ones that are closer to.I can touch and feel and I I can see this much has been removed and someone can put a stamp on it.Another question related to that is what is the relative value or quality of the different credits, right?Buyers want to have confidence that they are purchasing actual carbon that's been removed.They don't want to purchase something and then find out they didn't actually remove on their behalf.It's a big reason why companies with the most aggressive climate commitments are backing new technologies.BC G estimates this market could reach as high as $135 billion by 2040 BC G has invested its own money signing partnerships with direct air capture companies like CLIM works to remove more than 140,000 tons of co two combined from the atmosphere.Companies from Alphabet to JP Morgan have invested more than $57 million in lithos as part of a consortium known as Frontier.The funds agreed to buy 100 54,000 tons of carbon from lithos in the next few years combined.Frontiers committed to buying nearly a billion dollars of carbon.By the end of the decade, we are moving so much material that anything that we can do to optimize the movement of that helps.So part of these large optic agreements, what they allow us to do is start leveraging more efficient methods of transportation like rail or like barge.Those methods can be extremely, extremely efficient, but you need to move a lot more minimum volume to get there.Impact is still hard to quantify though companies are required to measure and verify carbon credits that are sold.One of the most important things is that clear, MRV, the monitoring reporting and verification if you can clearly articulate and, and prove that you have captured a ton when you say you've captured a ton, but there's not a universal standard right now.Correct.That's correct.And it gets really tricky when you start to look at different technologies with enhanced rock weathering, you basically you take rocks, you scatter them and these rocks will absorb co two.And in these situations where you have the capture occurring over it could be acres, it could be thousands of acres, you can't possibly measure every single rock, right?So how do you sample it?And up with an agreed upon number, that is the removal that can then be sold.Soil samples can point to the amount of co two captured on farms, but that carbon doesn't stay locked up until it makes its way to the ocean where it's sealed off for good.So what you actually measure here is not necessarily ultimately what becomes the credit?That's correct.Yeah, this is of the initial step in the process, right?What we're measuring here is exactly how fast the rock is dissolving in the field, how much carbon dioxide that is pulling down.And then we look at all the downstream effects, we call it kind of like a trade over to grave accounting, right?So we look at the effects here.We look at what's happening in the rivers.We also even model what's happening in the oceans.We take all of that into account before we kind of say, hey, here's, here's a ton of carbon that we've captured.We're doing custom application here.Uh We're actually applying um basalt and material here for another farmer.Farmers like Rick Bennett are keeping a close eye on their fields.Litho says the tiny rocks are helping improve crop yields by up to 57%.In addition to handling and paying for every step of the process.Lithos pays him, farmers get $50 an acre as part of the program.What's the result?Then, from a yield perspective, has it actually improved the quality of the soil?Has it improved your yield?We have only had one season with it on the land.We truly in our test, didn't see a yield increase last year, but we also did not lose any ground on our yield from the previous year.So we're excited to measure the results again.This year, we think there will be definitely a yield increase.Lithos expects to capture up to 50,000 tons of Co two on farms this year, hundreds of other farmers are waiting to partner with the company, but they'll need to scale much more than that with demand for carbon credits, far outpacing existing supply in the market.Our goal is in the next 3 to 4 years to get as much data as possible that allow us to go the full way models that allow us to say, hey, we know the soil types, you know the crop types, we know the climate, we see ourselves building something like the Google maps of enhanced weathering from there being able to scale down our measurement cost that really really to the whole lion's share of profits at the moment scale down this cost, reach more farmers faster scale this up for society.The need is so great, right?We are at the kill a ton scale today, we need to get to the gig Aon scale in the future.That is a factor of a million growth today.CD R is an optional thing and it's starting to change.But until it becomes required, it's only going to be limited to those who are willing to do it voluntarily.The only way we can scale the, the technologies as fast as we need is if many of them succeed.So this isn't, I need deck and not trees.This isn't, I need enhanced rock weathering and not biochar.This is I need all of it and I need all of them to scale the eu and the US have proposed guidelines to scrutinize the quality of carbon credits in the voluntary market.But mire says mandating offsets are critical to bringing costs down a necessary step to getting companies to their net zero goals.Lithos currently charges $370 a ton.The goal is to slash that to 100.So our goal is to be capturing billions of tons of carbon dioxide using enhanced rock weathering.We know that's possible.Our goal is to really be at maybe 2 to 6 billion tons worldwide.How many farms you need to spread this across?How many acres of you need to cover to get to that goal.It's not even all of the world's farming land is actually just a fraction of it.So in America, if we just focus alone on corn and soybean crops, and there's many other things we grow obviously, but if we just focus on that alone, we believe we could capture up to 0.7 gigatons of 700 million tons of carbon dioxide.So that's the key.",

scaling its operation with financial backing from frontier  a consortium of investors that include meta  meta   alphabet  goog  googl   and jpmorgan  jpm   the climate fund  led by payments processing company stripe  committed  57 1 million to lithos carbon last year to remove over 154 000 tons of carbon lithos carbon is one of hundreds of startups globally that are competing in a carbon removal industry expected to reach  135 billion by 2040  according to consulting firm bcg once considered a workaround for critical emission cutting work  carbon removal technologies  which extract and sequester carbon dioxide emissions from the atmosphere  are increasingly seen as a necessary step to capping global warming at 1 5 degrees celsius by 2050  as laid out in the paris agreement the un s intergovernmental panel on climate change has said the world needs to remove up to 10 billion tons of carbon per year by the middle of the century to avoid the worst impacts of climate change roughly 2 400 companies have disclosed having net zero targets in place  according to nonprofit group cdp  many of those firms are turning to carbon removal technologies to offset emissions  as they realize that emissions reductions alone won t get them within their net zero goals  demand for carbon credits is projected to quadruple from 2030 to 2040  according to bcg big tech firms are among the biggest buyers of carbon removal credits  microsoft  msft   the leading buyer globally  has purchased more than 7 6 million carbon credits  since 2020 according to online tracker cdr fyi if you re going to

was written by akiko fujita and luke brooks video transcriptso the first thing we re gonna do is turn our spinner blades on you can already see a streak where we ve already spread out there rick bennett is a third generation farmer trying his hand at a new type of fertilizer crossed volcanic rock known as the salt story continuesthe rock dust is considered waste but one start up is finding new use for it to tackle a climate crisis workers here affectionately call this brown mountain lithos carbon considers it gold this material is what s chemically reacting with carbon dioxide to permanently capture and sequester it into a form that takes it out of the atmosphere it s a process that happens naturally over thousands of years lithos carbon is spreading it on farms to accelerate it to two years backed by a  57 million investment from frontier  a consortium of companies that includes meta and jp morgan there are some portions of company emissions that you will just never abate recognizing that they have a net zero target and they want to actually get to zero and honor very public commitments they have to invest in some sort of removal technology scientists say it s not enough to reduce carbon emissions but capture them with co 21 of the leading causes of climate change  which is why hundreds of companies are pouring into the carbon removal space the question is  which can scale up quickly cheaply with the future of our environment at stake this is what s next in carbon removal we ve got drill rigs prepping for the next shot we ve got blasters in here  loading for a shot this quarry is so busy uh  we blast a couple times a week out here and that could drop 50 to 60 000 tons of rock at a time onto the ground how far down are we right now we re about 100 ft down in this active pit state of north carolina we can mine down to 500 ft deep so we re gonna be here a very long time mining the  this fight against climate change begins with one of the most abundant resources on the planet basalt has long been considered the building blocks used in asphalt and concrete some rock quarry in north carolina has so much of it it ships out millions of tons every year we take that 36 inch boulder and we crush it down to sand size particles that we can put in the asphalt and concrete and from that surge pile  it ll get crushed again  it ll get screened  it ll get washed and it ll kind of continue on that process until it gets to a final product size and spec and stockpiled some rock uses every piece of that rock except the dust of waste that piles up in the end this is the secret this is what we looked all over the country for is this this particular material not all the salt is quality that lithos wants can you tell by just looking at it or do you actually have to you can t yeah so if we look at it under an electron microscope  we re looking at all the properties that make it suitable for the carbon capture process and also release the nutrients that helps the soil and the plants grow in it as well it s part of a process called enhanced rock weathering  carbon dioxide in the atmosphere combines with rainwater to create a weak form of acid rain that rain hits volcanic rocks it leads to a chemical reaction that traps co2 it s a natural process that takes thousands of years lithos carbon is speeding that up more than 1000 times by spreading the finest form of rock dust across farm fields the thinking is the more surface area  the rocks cover  the more carbon is captured li says all of the rain combined with the salt also helps improve crop yields farms are extra special and extra powerful for a few reasons one the roots  they break up the rock dust faster so that s great to the farmers already need to spread rock dust in their field they need to do this to rehabilitate their soils after we use synthetic fertilizer  the farmers  they re already spreading rock that we re actually replacing something they already do today with something that works even better so it s plugging into existing infrastructure piggy backing on that and allowing us to scale this climate crisis faster so the drill goes in  it pulls the dirt right up into the bucket the soil is manually tested every two acres every six months to measure the amount of carbon captured enhanced rock weathering is one of many solutions in a growing industry with demand projected to quadruple from 2030 to 2040 according to consulting firm bc g  there are already more than 220 carbon removal companies globally there s multiple different pathways  chemical pathways for which you can take co two out of air and no one really knows for sure yet  which ones are going to be able to scale the fastest and come down the price curve most effectively and so it really starts to become a complicated puzzle of which technologies work in the right atmospheres or in the right uh environments to optimize all of this and we need some of all of them this satellite image of carbon in the atmosphere points to the scale of the problem humans have dumped two trillion tons of co2 into the air  pushing global temperatures more than two degrees above pre industrial levels the un panel on climate change says we need to remove up to 10 billion tons per year by 2050 to avoid the worst impacts of climate change  that amounts to roughly 25  of annual carbon emissions today  that many of those emissions will be eliminated through various reduction measures so more efficient motors  cleaner power  et cetera  but there is still a large amount of emissions that ultimately will have to be taken out of the atmosphere in some way if we want to get to net zero  that s where carbon removal comes in even with all of the efforts to decarbonize bcgs current mystery estimates  companies will still fall more than 30  short of their goal to be truly net zero that means they ll need to buy carbon credits from companies like lithos to offset emissions they can t reduce on their own i think all of these sort of front runners in the carbon market  they re not just interested in what they can buy today they re investing in the future of the carbon di remo market  the scale of the problem they recognize that investment is needed so they are looking to kind of support pathways there are a lot of ways to remove carbon  but there s a trade off between affordability and reliability direct air capture has the simplest measuring system  but it requires building large factories that can suck co2 out of the air it costs up to  1000 to capture a ton of carbon methods that rely on agricultural waste are considered cheaper  but it requires a lot of land enhanced rock weathering uses a smaller footprint but critics say there s too much uncertainty there isn t enough data to show how effective the process is planting trees may be economical but mire says the carbon storage isn t as permanent precise measurements are harder to come by you can estimate how much carbon is in the tree but there are questions like what happens if it gets cut down what happens if there s a forest fire and so in all of these technologies  they all have various pros and cons but in general  the higher quality ones or the higher durability ones are the ones that are closer to i can touch and feel and i i can see this much has been removed and someone can put a stamp on it another question related to that is what is the relative value or quality of the different credits  right buyers want to have confidence that they are purchasing actual carbon that s been removed they don t want to purchase something and then find out they didn t actually remove on their behalf it s a big reason why companies with the most aggressive climate commitments are backing new technologies bc g estimates this market could reach as high as  135 billion by 2040 bc g has invested its own money signing partnerships with direct air capture companies like clim works to remove more than 140 000 tons of co two combined from the atmosphere companies from alphabet to jp morgan have invested more than  57 million in lithos as part of a consortium known as frontier the funds agreed to buy 100 54 000 tons of carbon from lithos in the next few years combined frontiers committed to buying nearly a billion dollars of carbon by the end of the decade  we are moving so much material that anything that we can do to optimize the movement of that helps so part of these large optic agreements  what they allow us to do is start leveraging more efficient methods of transportation like rail or like barge those methods can be extremely  extremely efficient  but you need to move a lot more minimum volume to get there impact is still hard to quantify though companies are required to measure and verify carbon credits that are sold one of the most important things is that clear  mrv  the monitoring reporting and verification if you can clearly articulate and  and prove that you have captured a ton when you say you ve captured a ton  but there s not a universal standard right now correct that s correct and it gets really tricky when you start to look at different technologies with enhanced rock weathering  you basically you take rocks  you scatter them and these rocks will absorb co two and in these situations where you have the capture occurring over it could be acres  it could be thousands of acres  you can t possibly measure every single rock  right so how do you sample it and up with an agreed upon number  that is the removal that can then be sold soil samples can point to the amount of co two captured on farms  but that carbon doesn t stay locked up until it makes its way to the ocean where it s sealed off for good so what you actually measure here is not necessarily ultimately what becomes the credit that s correct yeah  this is of the initial step in the process  right what we re measuring here is exactly how fast the rock is dissolving in the field  how much carbon dioxide that is pulling down and then we look at all the downstream effects  we call it kind of like a trade over to grave accounting  right so we look at the effects here we look at what s happening in the rivers we also even model what s happening in the oceans we take all of that into account before we kind of say  hey  here s  here s a ton of carbon that we ve captured we re doing custom application here uh we re actually applying um basalt and material here for another farmer farmers like rick bennett are keeping a close eye on their fields litho says the tiny rocks are helping improve crop yields by up to 57  in addition to handling and paying for every step of the process lithos pays him  farmers get  50 an acre as part of the program what s the result then  from a yield perspective  has it actually improved the quality of the soil has it improved your yield we have only had one season with it on the land we truly in our test  didn t see a yield increase last year  but we also did not lose any ground on our yield from the previous year so we re excited to measure the results again this year  we think there will be definitely a yield increase lithos expects to capture up to 50 000 tons of co two on farms this year  hundreds of other farmers are waiting to partner with the company  but they ll need to scale much more than that with demand for carbon credits  far outpacing existing supply in the market our goal is in the next 3 to 4 years to get as much data as possible that allow us to go the full way models that allow us to say  hey  we know the soil types  you know the crop types  we know the climate  we see ourselves building something like the google maps of enhanced weathering from there being able to scale down our measurement cost that really really to the whole lion s share of profits at the moment scale down this cost  reach more farmers faster scale this up for society the need is so great  right we are at the kill a ton scale today  we need to get to the gig aon scale in the future that is a factor of a million growth today cd r is an optional thing and it s starting to change but until it becomes required  it s only going to be limited to those who are willing to do it voluntarily the only way we can scale the  the technologies as fast as we need is if many of them succeed so this isn t  i need deck and not trees this isn t  i need enhanced rock weathering and not biochar this is i need all of it and i need all of them to scale the eu and the us have proposed guidelines to scrutinize the quality of carbon credits in the voluntary market but mire says mandating offsets are critical to bringing costs down a necessary step to getting companies to their net zero goals lithos currently charges  370 a ton the goal is to slash that to 100 so our goal is to be capturing billions of tons of carbon dioxide using enhanced rock weathering we know that s possible our goal is to really be at maybe 2 to 6 billion tons worldwide how many farms you need to spread this across how many acres of you need to cover to get to that goal it s not even all of the world s farming land is actually just a fraction of it so in america  if we just focus alone on corn and soybean crops  and there s many other things we grow obviously  but if we just focus on that alone  we believe we could capture up to 0 7 gigatons of 700 million tons of carbon dioxide so that s the key ',

                        'The ingenuity shown by the most innovative companies means that the stock market keeps producing life-changing growth stocks every year. These young companies continue to become behemoths. For example, who would have imagined Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) growth trajectory when it listed in 1986 with a $777 million market capitalization?Today, the conditions are ripe for the next generation of growth stocks. The job market is robust and supporting a resilient consumer. Also, business-to-business spending is booming due to fiscal spending incentives and the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. Furthermore, the Federal Reserve has hit pause, with a high probability of a cut as the next move.These positive macro conditions and the technical momentum of this bull market set the stage for the following life-changing growth stocks. Due to their growth runway, they can grow revenues for decades. Buy them today to compound your returns for years.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsShopify (SHOP)Shopify on the phone display.Source: Burdun Iliya / Shutterstock.comThe bullish case for Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) is simple: it will ride the e-commerce wave for decades. Indeed, after the recent pullback, it’s one of the life-changing growth stocks to buy.Shopify enables merchants to start and scale their businesses and has become the de facto platform for small businesses to sell their products globally. Indeed, it has enjoyed tremendous success, growing revenues from $105 million in 2014 to $7.4 billion in the trailing twelve months. Yet despite the 70x revenue growth, Shopify is just getting started.Taking the long-term view, Shopify has a gigantic opportunity. Today, global e-commerce penetration is under 25% of total sales. Statista estimates that e-commerce revenues will grow at approximately 9.49% annually between 2024 and 2029, hitting $6.4 trillion by the end of the period.As a key player in e-commerce, SHOP will benefit tremendously from increased e-commerce penetration. Furthermore, its aggressive pursuit of the enterprise market will accelerate growth. Brands like Kylie Cosmetics, Coach, Overstock, Heinz, SKIMS and Supreme have launched on the platform due to its capabilities and value.Lastly, Shopify sees a significant opportunity in the global B2B e-commerce market. In Q1 of 2024, gross merchandise volume in this segment grew 130% year-over-year (YOY). In summation, enterprise, B2B e-commerce and new growth vectors like payments mean SHOP stock will be a multibagger.BellRing Brands (BRBR)A picture of the Clean Whey Protein Bar flavoured vanilla coconut crunch.Source: JJava Designs / Shutterstock.comStory continuesBellRing Brands (NYSE:BRBR) is one of the fastest-growing consumer staples stocks. In the most recent quarter, it posted 28% YOY revenue growth. This growth shows that the company is capitalizing on the expansion of the convenient nutrition category, which grew 5% in the quarter.Cowen analyst Robert Moskow thinks that BellRing Brands is well-positioned to benefit from the adoption of ready-to-drink shakes. Particularly, he sees massive growth potential due to the use of RTD shakes in weight management. Notably, shakes are taking share from bars and household penetration has grown from 38% in 2019 to 45% in 2023.Also, Moskow points out that shake adoption is higher among younger demographics. Therefore, this creates a long growth runway for BellRing Brands, making it one of the best life-changing growth stocks. He projects that the company will achieve a 13% revenue CAGR over the next three years.Overall, the business is accelerating due to rising shake demand and new shake capacity. With the capacity expansion, RTD shake production will increase by 20%. This will drive the introduction of new flavors that will grow BellRing’s customer base.Management’s fiscal 2024 guidance estimates net sales in the $1.93 billion to $1.99 billion range, representing at least 15% growth. That’s one of the highest growth rates in consumer staples, highlighting why BRBR stock will be a winner.Nextracker (NXT)A photo of the sun in a partly cloudy sky with an orange filter.Source: Ed Connor/ShutterStock.comOne of the top secular trends is the shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy necessitated by global warming. Wood Mackenzie estimates that installed global solar power capacity will triple by 2033. This expansion bodes well for Nextracker (NASDAQ:NXT), a leader in solar tracker technology.This solar solutions provider is integral to utility-scale solar deployments, providing solar tracker technologies. Its solutions, which include software, enable solar panels to move with the sun’s direction, enabling increased energy production. Notably, utilities and power generation projects have adopted these solutions due to optimized energy production that delivers a significant return on investment.Nextracker is seeing significant demand and revenues are surging. In the recent quarter, Q4 fiscal year 2024, sales increased by 42% to $737 million. This revenue growth rate accelerated from the 38% achieved in Q3 of 2024, highlighting the incredible momentum.Moreover, management provided upbeat guidance for fiscal year 2025. Management issued revenue guidance in the range of $2.8 billion to $2.9 billion, at least 12% growth. Even better, they expect adjusted EBITDA to increase from $521 million to between $600 million to $650 million. Considering these growth numbers, Nextracker is one of the best life-changing growth stocks to buy.On the date of publication, Charles Munyi had long positions in SHOP and NXT and did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in other securities mentioned in this article.

                        "Both Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Shopify (NYSE: SHOP) are incredible businesses. Both target e-commerce spending, which has grown at double-digit percentage rates for years, and is expected to do so for years to come.When it comes to high-upside stocks, both of these companies fit the bill. But which stock has the potential to deliver the biggest profits to those who buy in today?Amazon has achieved greatness -- and that's a bit of a problemAmazon needs no introduction. It's one of the largest online retailers in the world. Its market cap is nearly $2 trillion. Last year, the company posted annual sales of $575 billion.But it wasn't always this way. In the late 1990s, Amazon's total valuation was under $1 billion. In fact, the company almost went bankrupt during the dot-com crash.If you had invested $1,000 in Amazon when it began its time as a public company and held on, that small initial holding would now be worth roughly $1 million. Of course, that hypothetical return would have been powered by Amazon's incredible growth. But it would also have been a function of investing early. At its lowest, Amazon's market cap was around $450 million. It's not just investing in a great company that produces a huge result, but investing in a great company before most of its growth has occurred.Analyzing Amazon's valuation over the years demonstrates this lesson well. At the start of 2016, Amazon's market cap was around $300 billion. Over the next four years, it tripled in size to roughly $900 billion. Over the next four years, however, the company grew in size by just 70%. That's still a respectable return, but the lesson -- what the business world calls \"the law of large numbers\" -- is clear: The bigger a company grows, the harder it is for that company to maintain its prior growth rate.To be fair, Amazon's stock price has continued to beat the market for a far longer period than most anticipated. And it appears that good days are still to come for the company and its investors. Yet the law of large numbers suggests there's a better investment option in the e-commerce space for those looking for maximum upside potential.SHOP Market Cap ChartShopify has room to grow behind the scenesWhile Amazon focused on building a centralized, two-sided marketplace, Shopify has built an e-commerce platform that allows merchants to sell through their own individualized websites. You've likely shopped at Shopify-powered websites before, unaware that it was providing the platform that made everything possible on the back end. Through its platform, anyone can begin selling online within minutes, with design, inventory, advertising, content creation, and payment solutions ready to go.Story continuesShopify's total addressable market is essentially all of e-commerce minus the segment controlled by centralized platforms like Amazon or eBay. Given that global e-commerce spending as a whole is expected to surpass $6 trillion this year, that's a giant opportunity. Shopify has built an early lead, too. In the U.S. market, it has a 28% market share -- nearly as large a slice as its next two competitors combined.After a recent share price pullback, Shopify has a market cap of just $79 billion. That's less than 5% of Amazon's current size. To be sure, Amazon has a variety of other businesses beyond e-commerce, including a massive web services division. But investors should expect the size gap between these two companies to narrow in the years and decades to come. Amazon is still a wonderful business, and likely a good investment. However, for Shopify to quadruple in value, it would only need to attain a $316 billion market cap. Amazon quadrupling in value would bring its market cap to $7.6 trillion. Which of those will happen first? My money is on Shopify hitting $316 billion.Should you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

                        "E-commerce giant Shopify has scored a legal victory after a Delaware, US, federal court overturned a jury's decision that required the company to pay $40m for patent infringement, Reuters reported.The lawsuit, filed by patent-holding plaintiff Express Mobile in 2019, alleged Shopify's website-building tools infringed on its patents related to mobile content delivery.According to Reuters, judge Richard Andrews ruled in favour of Shopify, citing insufficient evidence to support the jury's original verdict.The disputed patents, owned by Express Mobile founder Steven Rempell (formerly of IBM), pertain to software functionalities for mobile devices.Express Mobile has a history of suing tech companies over patent infringement, with Google, Meta, and Amazon being previous targets.Reuters noted a key factor in the court's new decision was the lack of evidence that Shopify merchants directly used the features in question.While Shopify provides website-building tools, the judge pointed out that individual merchants have control over their storefronts' functionalities.This disconnect between the platform and merchant actions proved crucial in the case.Shopify hailed the decision as a 'significant victory' against what it termed as 'patent trolls.''Patent trolls' are companies that acquire patents not to develop products, but to sue others for alleged infringement.This win sets a precedent for future cases and strengthens Shopify's legal standing in the e-commerce space.Earlier this month, Shopify reported a robust first quarter (Q1) of 2024, exceeding analyst expectations for both revenue and earnings per share.However, the company’s tempered Q2 forecast has raised investor concerns about maintaining high growth rates in a potentially challenging economic climate.\"Shopify overturns $40m patent infringement verdict\" was originally created and published by Retail Insight Network, a GlobalData owned brand. The information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

                        "Shares of Shopify (NYSE: SHOP), the most popular e-commerce software platform in the U.S., have risen by more than 2,000% since going public in 2015. The S&P 500, for comparison, rose by just 195% over the same period.The best news is that Shopify stock could rise another 2,000% in the years to come. If you're looking for stocks with massive upside, this one's for you.Shopify has a massive lead on the competition and it's not even closeThere are two critical factors to pay attention to when it comes to Shopify. The first is the competitive landscape. In this regard, Shopify is undoubtedly king.When most people think of e-commerce, they think of companies like Amazon, which sell products and services online. But there's another type of e-commerce business, and that's platforms that allow others to set up digital storefronts of their own. Shopify, for instance, doesn't run any of its own stores. Instead, millions of merchants run their stores using Shopify's platform. Small home businesses use Shopify-powered stores, but so do major brands, including Nike, Allbirds, and Red Bull.Let's say you want to start selling online. You could list your products on Amazon, but you'll have to give the company anywhere from 8% to 45% of your sales. Shopify, meanwhile, takes only a small percentage of your sales as a fee, and in return gives you all the things you need to establish a successful e-commerce business. That includes web design templates, marketing and analytics tools, inventory management dashboards, payment processing, and more. You won't have the immediate reach of a platform like Amazon, but you'll have more tools, customization options, and functionality, plus you'll retain a much greater portion of your sales.According to data compiled by Statista, Shopify has a 28% market share for e-commerce platforms in the U.S. WooCommerce commands an 18% market share, while Wix comes in third with 17%. Total e-commerce spending, meanwhile, is on the rise. In 2019, e-commerce spending in the U.S. totaled $540 million. Last year, it surpassed $1 billion. By 2029, it's expected to approach $1.9 billion. E-commerce platforms like Shopify, then, are swimming in a bigger and bigger pool of potential customers. As you'll see, there's a good chance Shopify will not only maintain its current industry lead but expand on it in the years to come.Artificial intelligence could put this stock on steroidsThe second reason to love Shopify stock right now is that it's perfectly positioned to benefit from the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). E-commerce platforms like Shopify, WooCommerce, and Wix all compete a bit on price. But what they compete on most is functionality and user experience. Whichever platform makes its platform more powerful and easier to use wins.Story continuesWith the largest market share, Shopify has an early lead. AI should accelerate this lead even further in the years to come. That's because Shopify has the resources to attract the most AI developers to its platform. Right now, any developer can add more functionality to Shopify's platform, earning money whenever users decide to incorporate the new tool or service. Developers know that Shopify offers them the largest potential user base to monetize their creations. Already, the company has dozens of AI apps and features that users can implement in a few clicks -- everything from chatbots to automated content creation. As AI takes off, expect Shopify to benefit, gaining more market share in an already large and growing market.How big could Shopify get? After a recent pullback, the company is valued at just $75 billion. Amazon, for comparison, is worth around $1.9 trillion. Shopify would have more than 2,000% in upside if it reached Amazon's size. To be clear, Amazon is a far more diverse and far larger business than Shopify. It will take years or even decades for Shopify to attain a $1 trillion market cap, let alone a $2 trillion market cap. But it is businesses like this that can sustain growth for long enough to reach this enormous size.The global e-commerce market is clearly large enough to accommodate a Shopify 10 or 20 times its current size. Keep in mind, this underlying market is still growing by around 10% annually. Much of that growth will be directed to large, consolidated e-commerce sites like Amazon. But independent stores, such as those powered by Shopify, will also take an increasing amount of this new market growth. After a 25% decline in share price over the last 90 days -- a drop fueled by short-term concerns over quarterly guidance -- this is a great time to back up the truck for a high-quality business with a massive long-term growth runway.Should you invest $1,000 in Shopify right now?Before you buy stock in Shopify, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Shopify wasn’t one of them.

                        'We recently compiled a list of the 15 Best Places to Retire in Canada on a Budget and in this article, we will talk about the best place to retire in Canada on a budget.When most individuals think of retirement, they perceive it as the idea of working till they are in their mid-sixties before drawing the curtains on their professional journey and stepping into a life of leisure. However, lately, this notion of retirement has become less appealing, especially to those who are over 2 decades away from retirement. According to Wealthsimple Inc., 74% of Canadians between the ages of 24 and 44 say that this conventional approach to retirement is an outdated concept. Instead, these individuals would prefer to retire much earlier in the hopes of pursuing other professional and personal aspirations during their retirement. In fact, Wealthsimple reports that 41% of individuals in their sample are motivated to retire before the age of 55, roughly 10 years earlier than the average age of retirement in Canada. One method to achieve such a swift retirement could be with a method referred to as FIRE.Financial Independence-Retire EarlyFIRE, or Financial Independence-Retire Early, is a movement that encourages individuals to resort to an extremely frugal lifestyle during the initial phase of their career in the hopes of retiring early and gaining financial independence. Shopify Inc. (NYSE: SHOP) reports that the movement gained momentum in the US around the start of the pandemic. Moreover, a 2020 survey by Shopify Inc. (NYSE: SHOP) found that 9% of non-retired adults in the US reported they were actively pursuing FIRE.Unfortunately, such an audacious route towards retirement might not be for everyone. FIRE is highly skewed towards a certain demographic which Shopify Inc. (NYSE: SHOP) describes as single, millennial men in a high-earning bracket. Thus, for those living outside of this particular demographic, the ambition of an early & comfortable retirement might be nothing more than a pipe dream. To make matters worse, recent studies by the Bank of Montreal (NYSE: BMO) show that since the pandemic, even those pursuing a conventional career path might struggle to cope with the financial challenges of retirement.Retirement Struggles in CanadaAccording to the Bank of Montreal (NYSE: BMO), Canadians now believe that they need $1.7 million to fund the retirement they expect. In the case of millennials, the figure is even higher. Core-working-age millennials believe they require $2.1 million to be able to secure their retirement, per the Bank of Montreal (NYSE: BMO). These sums are the consequence of a rapid rate of inflation and significant increases in the cost of living all over the country, as revealed in a 2023 survey by The Toronto-Dominion Bank (NYSE: TD).Story continuesThe Toronto-Dominion Bank (NYSE: TD) reports that 71% of Canadians cited a high cost of living and inflation as a challenge that made accomplishing their financial goals more difficult in the preceding year. Similar findings were reported by The Bank of Nova Scotia (NYSE: BNS), who revealed that 55% of Canadians believe their retirement plans have been impacted by current economic conditions. Consequently, The Toronto-Dominion Bank (NYSE: TD) reports that 43% of Canadians are not confident they will be able to retire when they initially planned.The idea of delaying retirement isn’t anything new, and given the current economic pressures, it might actually be the smartest decision. The extra income obtained by extending one’s career can help cater to long-term needs that aren’t considered during retirement planning.  According to Rebekah Young at The Bank of Nova Scotia (NYSE: BNS), it is time to rethink retirement and to be mindful of the financial impact of long-term care needs.“Less than one-in-three Canadians consider long-term care needs, though only one-in-ten have actually set aside funds to pay for it…. Even modest out-of-pocket expenses to support aging in place would quickly overwhelm most households.” - Rebekah Young, Head of Inclusion and Resilience Economics, The Bank of Nova Scotia (NYSE: BNS)A recent report by ClearBridge Investments highlighted how The Bank of Nova Scotia (NYSE: BNS) was among the best individual stocks in terms of contributions to absolute return during Q1 2024. BNS shares have gained value since October 2023, closing April with a forward P/E ratio of 9.53, a 7.3% YoY increase. In general, Canadian dividend stocks have fared well in the market this year, with 9 out of 11 sectors posting positive returns.While we at Insider Monkey recognize the stability and potential of BNS stocks, we strongly believe that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. By checking out our report on the cheapest AI stock you can obtain our insights on an investment that has the potential to secure you a 10,000% return over the next decade.As Canadians consider the possibilities of early or late retirement, it is also important to consider geographical factors that can have a profound impact on retirement expenses. Our lists of best and worst places to retire in Canada are incredibly insightful in this regard. However, for those wondering where is the most economical place to retire in Canada or what is the best place to retire in Canada income-wise, join us as we look at the best places to retire in Canada on a budget. Alternatively, you may check out some of the warmest and cheapest places to live in Canada by perusing our lists on Ontario and British Columbia.The Best Place to Retire in Canada on a BudgetBest Place to Retire in Canada on a BudgetMethodologyTo develop our list of the best places to retire in Canada on a budget, we initially picked out the most recommended places to retire in Canada on a budget on the Internet. We used 10+ sources including our list of Best Places to Retire in Canada, Best Places to Retire in BC (British Columbia) on a Budget, and Best Places to Retire in Ontario to develop a shortlist. Further research was narrowed down to these places only.Among these best places to retire in Canada on a budget, we developed a scorecard using metrics such as livability scores, cost of living, average rent, and median home prices. Livability scores were sourced from Area Vibes while median home prices were obtained from Houseful.ca and WOWA.ca. The average rent was obtained from Zumper and Rentals.ca. By standardizing these metrics on a linear scale, each place was scored, based on which we sorted our list in descending order. The top 15 places were chosen as the best places to retire in Canada on a budget.Our methodology revealed that Fredericton is the best place to retire in Canada on a budget.1. Fredericton, New BrunswickInsider Monkey Score: 16.99Livability Score: 84Median Home Price: $422KAverage Rent: $850IM Cost of Living: 91.1Fredericton is the capital of New Brunswick, the largest of Canada’s three maritime provinces.

While there are many parks scattered throughout the city, residents can visit the Killarney Lake Park or the Hyla Park Nature Reserve where they can find animals such as deer, foxes, martens, and otters.In terms of affordability, Fredericton has the lowest average rent on our list. Moreover, with a cost of living of 9.9% under the national average, living in this city is one of the best ways to conserve your savings during your golden years.

                        "When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Shopify (SHOP) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.Shopify currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 2.00, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 39 brokerage firms. An ABR of 2.00 indicates Buy.Of the 39 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 19 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 48.7% and 2.6% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for SHOPBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for SHOPCheck price target & stock forecast for Shopify here>>>The ABR suggests buying Shopify, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.ABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Story continuesAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Should You Invest in SHOP?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Shopify, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $0.96.Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Shopify. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>It may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for Shopify.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

                        'Cathie Wood\'s Latest Bargain Buy - Down Over 20% YTDBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.Cathie Wood, the CEO of ARK Invest, is known for her early insights into pandemic digital trends. She often takes unpopular views on stocks.Wood has long supported Shopify Inc (NYSE:SHOP), the e-commerce platform operator. However, over the past year, she has reduced her ETF holdings in the company. Recently, Shopify’s stock price experienced a sharp decline, prompting ARK Invest to acquire shares once more. Here’s a closer look at her perspective.Shopify’s Q1 Results Triggered a Sell-OffOn May 8, Shopify released its first-quarter results. However, these results disappointed investors, causing the stock price to fall by 26%.The company’s second-quarter revenue forecast aligns with Wall Street’s expectations. Additionally, Shopify reported a 23% increase in revenue compared to the previous year. Shopify reversed a $193 million deficit from the previous year, reporting a positive operating income of $86 million in Q1. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.20 exceeded the consensus forecast of $0.17.However, the company’s gross margin projections garnered interest. Management projected a slight contraction. The second quarter gross margin is projected to contract by approximately 50 basis points to around 50.9%. In contrast, Shopify’s gross margin increased from 47.5% in Q1 2023 to 51.4% last quarter.Shopify’s stock traded at a price-to-sales ratio of 16 earlier this year; it stayed above 13 before the Q1 release. These high multiples meant that even minor quarterly report disappointments could shake investor confidence.Trending: Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are bullish on one city that could dethrone New York and become the new financial capital of the US. Investing in its booming real estate market has never been more accessible.Shopify Falls, But Wood Remains BullishShopify’s sales have been growing by double digits each quarter. Additionally, it boosts profits.In Q1, free cash flow tripled to $232 million. However, selling its logistics business temporarily lowers profits. Shopify expects this move to bring positive results soon.Management remains confident in the company’s market potential and anticipates growth and profits. Shopify briefly achieved this during the early pandemic surge. It also has a clear plan with many growth strategies.Harley Finkelstein, president of Shopify, described it as a "phenomenal year" during a conference call with analysts."And as a result, we continue to breakdown barriers, accelerate the power of entrepreneurship, and fuel our merchants’ success," he said. "No matter which way you look at our business ᅳ whether it’s merchants, products, or channels ᅳ we delivered an incredible fourth quarter to finish an amazing year of growth."Story continuesIn Q1, offline gross merchandise volume (GMV) increased 32% year over year, outpacing total increase of 23%. GMV also rose 130% in business-to-business trade during the quarter.Representing the portion of sales handled by Shopify Payments, Shopify’s gross payments volume climbed to 60% of sales in Q1 from 56% the previous year. Comprising 74% of the company’s overall quarterly income, merchant solutions income was primarily related to gross payment volume.The Real Opportunity In Today’s MarketThe current high-interest-rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through dividend stocks...

                        "Unusually high inflation and a rising-interest-rate environment have played critical roles in impacting the macroeconomy over the last couple of years. Yet despite these economic pressures, the stock market has generally shown some signs of strength.Although the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite cratered by 33% in 2022, the index demonstrated key resiliency last year -- surging 43%, thanks to the evolving euphoria surrounding artificial intelligence (AI). This momentum has carried over into 2024; the Nasdaq has already returned approximately 13% so far this year.Since its inception in 1971, the Nasdaq has only produced consecutive years of negative returns on two occasions. The last time it happened was between 2000 and 2002.Given the secular tailwinds fueling AI right now, I see further gains on the horizon for the technology sector. Below, I'll break down five stocks operating at the intersection of software and AI and assess why each is a compelling buy for long-term investors.1. PalantirPalantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR) is an enterprise-software platform that's used by the U.S. Military and its Western allies, as well as large corporations in the private sector. AI-powered software is an intense market dominated by big tech. Nevertheless, Palantir has done a respectable job making a name for itself.Over the last year, the company resorted to an unorthodox lead generation strategy to market its newest product, the Palantir Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP). Specifically, the company has been hosting immersive seminars called \"boot camps\" during which prospective customers can demo the company's software and identify a use case.This approach appears to be paying off in spades. For the quarter ended March 31, Palantir grew its customer count 42% year over year. But more importantly, the company is expanding outside of its legacy government contracting business at a rapid pace. Its U.S. commercial customer count rose 69% year over year during the first quarter.In addition to accelerating revenue, Palantir's operating margins are also expanding. This is flowing straight to the bottom line, as the company is generating positive net income and free cash flow.Its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 21 isn't necessarily dirt cheap, but the chart below helps put things into perspective. Considering Palantir's current P/S is far below prior highs, now could be an interesting time to buy the dip.PLTR PS Ratio Chart2. ShopifyShopify (NYSE: SHOP) is an e-commerce platform for small and mid-size enterprises (SME), as well as large corporations.Story continuesThe charts below illustrate some important financial metrics for Shopify. Overall, I'd say the company's revenue, margins, and cash flow are all trending in the right direction. However, there are a couple of important items to note.SHOP Revenue (Quarterly) ChartNamely, Shopify's operating performance has been inconsistent over the last few years. Much of this can be attributed to a botched acquisition of a logistics company called Flexport, as well as a series of layoffs to help reduce costs. Moreover, Shopify stock is trading at a noticeable premium when you compare it to a cohort of e-commerce peers.SHOP PS Ratio ChartShopify represents something of a turnaround story. I suspect that the company will invest aggressively in new products and services, an effort that will take a toll on short-term profits. However, these moves are a compelling strategy to build out a long-term growth narrative.Moreover, I wouldn't discount Shopify's potential as it relates to AI and fintech more broadly. While the company's valuation may be elevated at the moment, I'd still consider scooping up some shares of Shopify to hold for the long run.3. ServiceNowThe next company on my list is ServiceNow (NYSE: NOW), an enterprise software platform for IT management.What makes ServiceNow unique is its ability to cross-sell. Over the last two years, ServiceNow has expanded its number of customers paying at least $1 million per year from 1,405 to 1,933. With a renewal rate of 98%, the company boasts an extremely sticky customer base.Even better, as of March 31, ServiceNow had $17.7 billion in remaining performance obligations (RPO), representing 27% growth year over year. Not only is ServiceNow expanding existing customers and renewing at a high rate, but it's also achieving a high degree of net new business.NOW PS Ratio ChartWith a P/S of 16.8, ServiceNow looks undervalued, compared to many of its enterprise software-as-a-service peers.Image source: Getty Images4. Monday.comMonday.com (NASDAQ: MNDY) builds customer relationship management (CRM) and automation tools for the workplace productivity market -- an opportunity forecast to reach $13 trillion by 2030, according to Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood. While there are many workplace automation software tools available, Monday.com has demonstrated impressive growth.For the first quarter ended March 31, the company increased revenue 34% year over year to $217 million. Moreover, net dollar retention was 110%, implying that the company is expanding its existing customers while also generating strong new business.MNDY PS Ratio ChartSimilar to Shopify, Monday.com trades at a noticeable premium among its peers. The company is generating positive free cash flow, and its operating losses are nearing break-even levels. This has a lot to do with its impressive revenue acceleration -- which management believes will continue.I think Monday.com's premium is valid and see the stock as a good buy right now.5. CrowdStrikeCrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD) provides cloud-based identity management and endpoint cybersecurity solutions.Cybersecurity is an enormous market with many different use cases. Moreover, the proliferation of AI only adds to new use cases that can help fuel the cybersecurity realm in the long run. CrowdStrike's management believes its total addressable market currently sits at $100 billion. However, by 2028, management thinks the market opportunity will grow more than twofold to $225 billion.Considering that CrowdStrike's revenue is only $3 billion, the company appears to have a greenfield opportunity in front of it. Furthermore, its top line is growing well over 30% year over year, all while operating margins expand and are helping to fuel consistent profitability.While shares have soared 136% over the last year, the company's P/S ratio of 27.7 is well below its five-year average of 30.5. Now could be a great opportunity to scoop up some shares and enjoy the tailwinds fueling cybersecurity and AI.Should you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?Before you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Palantir Technologies wasn’t one of them.
