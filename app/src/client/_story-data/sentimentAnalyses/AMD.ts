                        "We recently compiled a list of the 15 Best Hardware Stocks According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stands against the other hardware stocks.With the first half of 2024 nearly over, artificial intelligence continues to play a dominant role in the stock market. Stocks that either design semiconductors that are used for AI applications, or those that use them to either streamline their internal operations such as coding or offer products to customers have also made significant gains. These show the optimism in Wall Street for accelerated computing technologies, which are collectively called artificial intelligence.In fact, the impact of AI has been so strong that not only has it upended the status quo of the most valuable firms in terms of market capitalization, but it also allowed some of the top AI companies to post triple digit percentage share price returns over the course of the past twelve months. Some of the top performing AI stocks are up by 213% over the past twelve months and have appreciated by 773% since November 2022. Back then, the stock market was whimpering in the aftermath of rapid interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve, which had hit technology stocks particularly hard since they benefit from a fast growth and low rate environment.However, AI's impact on the stock market has fueled the triple digit percentage gains in some stocks since then. At the same time, it has also meant that major indexes continue to demonstrate robust performance that is fueled by the share price performance of mega cap technology stocks.In 2024, the market has moved forward from investing in AI companies that can change the world with their hardware or software to evaluating whether these firms are delivering. The first quarter of the 2024 earnings season was the clearest example of this phenomenon, and it saw Wall Street take an unforgiving approach to large and small firms that presented even the slightest hint of being unable to either grow their revenues by targeting AI or control the costs of investing in the new technologies.Within the AI industry, there are different categories of firms. Most of these, such as OpenAI, operate on the software side. This industry subsegment develops applications such as chat bots and other assistants along with expanding the use of AI to existing software such as image editing tools. AI hardware companies power these applications, and when compared to the software firms, not only do they command stable valuations, but they also see investors take comfort in the fact that the demand for their products is far more stable and predictable when compared to software demand. Recently Goldman Sachs published a bullish report on hardware stocks due to AI, which we covered in 15 Best Hardware Stocks According To Goldman. In this article we are going to approach the same theme from a different angle and there are vast differences between both rankings of hardware stocks.Story continuesOur MethodologyTo make our list of the top hedge fund hardware stock picks, we ranked personal computing, semiconductor, and computer hardware by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q1 2024. Out of these, the stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors were selected. Basically our article listed the best hardware stocks to buy according to the 900+ equity hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).A close up of a complex looking PCB board with several intergrated semiconductor parts.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders In Q1 2024: 124Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) designs and sells GPUs and accelerators used for AI. June 2024 has been an important month for the firm as it joined NVIDIA at Computex to announce a slew of new products for AI processing. At the event, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) announced its Ryzen AI 300 series chips, which it believes offer the \"fastest APU performance\" in the world. The average of 41 one year analyst share price targets for Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is $187 and the shares are rated Strong Buy on average.For their first quarter of 2024 investment stakes, 124 hedge funds covered by Insider Monkey were Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)'s stakeholders. Ken Fisher's Fisher Asset Management held the most valuable stake which was worth $5.2 billion.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)'s story on the stock market has been one of constant growth over the past couple of years. The future might be bright too, as the market has set a forward P/E ratio of 49 for the company. Compared to the market's ratio of 21, the stock maintain its strong growth in the future. Meridian Funds commented on Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its Q4 2023 investor letter and shared:Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. is a global semiconductor chip maker specializing in central processing units (CPUs), which are considered the core component of most computing devices, and graphics processing units (GPUs), which accelerate operations running on CPUs. We invested in 2018 when it was a mid-cap value stock plagued by many years of underperformance due to lagging technology and lost market hishare versus competitors Intel and Nvidia. Our research identified that changes and investments made by current management under CEO Lisa Su had, over several years, finally resulted in compelling technology that positioned AMD as a stronger competitor to Nvidia and that its latest products were superior to Intel’s. We invested on the the belief that AMD’s valuation at that that time did not reflect the potential for its technology leadership to generate significant market share gains and improved profits. This thesis has been playing out for several years. During the quarter, AMD unveiled more details about its upcoming GPU products for the AI market. The stock reacted positively to expectations that AMD’s GPU servers will be a viable alternative to Nvidia. Although we pared back our exposure to AMD into strength as part of our risk-management practice, we maintained a position in the stock. We believe AMD will continue to gain share in large and growing markets and is reasonably valued relative to the potential for significantly higher earnings.Overall AMD ranks 4th on our list of the best hardware stocks to buy. You can visit 15 Best Hardware Stocks According to Hedge Funds to see the other hardware stocks that are on hedge funds’ radar. While we acknowledge the potential of AMD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock. READ NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \"Opportunity\" for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in June. Disclosure: None.

                        "Stock splits can be exciting for retail investors, particularly those whose brokerages might not offer them the option of purchasing fractional shares. I have lost count of the number of non-finance people suddenly asking me about Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock now that it's trading for \"just\" $130 a share.But while splits can make a stock appear cheaper, they have no impact on a company's valuations -- how the market prices it relative to sales, earnings, etc. -- nor on its market cap, which is the value of all its outstanding shares combined. In the case of Nvidia, that market cap is $3.2 trillion, making it the third-largest company in the world today, just a hair behind the one that makes iPhones.Is Nvidia stock still a buy at its current lofty market cap? Here are two reasons to continue hitting the buy button and one reason to consider jumping ship.Reason No. 1 to buy: The artificial intelligence industry is just getting startedIt has only been around two years since OpenAI took the world by storm with ChatGPT, a generative artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot capable of producing high-quality responses to user queries based on training data. Analysts are feverishly optimistic about the AI industry's potential, with Bloomberg Intelligence estimating it could be worth $1.3 trillion by 2032.If that forecast proves close to accurate, this will be an incredible opportunity for Nvidia, which is the leading maker of the specific types of powerful graphics processing units (GPUs) needed to run and train these advanced algorithms. Currently, it holds a market share of more than 80% in that hot niche, where demand is outstripping supply.While Nvidia will face growing competition from rival chipmakers such as Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) and Intel, it's protecting its market share via software solutions like CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture), a computing platform and programming interface that's bespoke for use with its hardware, and by constantly improving its offerings. According to CEO Jensen Huang, the company will henceforth release a new family of updated AI chips every single year (up from its prior pace of once every two years), making it even harder for rivals to keep up.Reason No. 2 to buy: Nvidia isn't overvalued relative to fundamentalsThe second bullish fact about Nvidia is its valuation. Despite rising by over 3,000% in the last five years, shares are still reasonably priced relative to the company's remarkable growth rate.Image source: Getty Images.With a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of just 48, Nvidia's shares are not much more expensive than other popular AI hardware stocks like AMD, which has a P/E of 47. To put this in context, in the first quarter, AMD's sales grew by just 2% year over year, while Nvidia's exploded by 262%.Story continuesThis valuation suggests Nvidia's stock could have more room to run if the AI industry lives up to analysts' expectations. But hold your horses -- there is one big risk factor new investors should be aware of.A reason to sell: Its uncanny resemblance to Cisco SystemsCisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO) is a computer hardware company that sold the routers and switches needed to build out the internet in the late 1990s. It was the \"picks and shovels\" way for investors to bet on what the smart money saw as a transformative new industry. And by the peak of the dot-com bubble in 2000, Cisco's market cap had hit $500 billion. Then the bubble burst, and it dropped by a staggering 88% within two years. The stock still hasn't recovered to its previous highs.Investors should take this as a cautionary tale, because Nvidia occupies a similar role in the AI space today, and any hit to its growth rate or pricing power could lead to a rapid collapse in its valuation, just like what happened to Cisco. While Nvidia investors have a lot to be excited about, they should also be aware of the potential risks this company faces before buying the stock, especially at its current valuation.Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

                        "\"We've seen a lot of exciting waves of technology in our industry -- the cloud, social, mobile -- but this AI wave is going be the biggest that anyone has ever seen.\" -- Salesforce CEO Marc BenioffThe artificial intelligence (AI) boom is set to be an enormously lucrative opportunity for savvy investors. Here are two AI leaders who are particularly well-positioned to deliver fortune-building gains to their shareholders in the coming years.1. Palantir TechnologiesGenerative AI model makers like OpenAI get a lot of attention, but the best AI investments are likely to be the analytics all-stars that can use AI to help companies make the most of their data. Palantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR) provides elite machine-learning technology and a game-changing new AI platform that can do just that.Palantir enables its clients to extract valuable insights from a variety of disparate data sources in real time. Its tools are prized by the U.S. military and multiple government agencies.On May 30, the company won a contract with an initial order of $153 million -- and additional awards of up to $480 million -- to make its AI operating system available across the Department of Defense. Palantir's head of defense growth, Shannon Clark, said the tools will enable commanders \"to make better, faster decisions across all domains at unprecedented scale.\"Its new Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) is also a hit with private companies. For example, Tampa General, a leading academic health system, recently chose AIP to be its core analytics and AI platform.Notably, Tampa General credits Palantir with helping it slash the amount of time required to place patients by 83%. \"Less time waiting for placement and a reduced length of stay does not just enhance the patient experience, it gives us an opportunity to treat more patients that need care,\" Tampa General Hospital CEO John Couris said on June 5.These real-world benefits are driving customers to Palantir. Its revenue rose by 21% year over year to $634 million in the first quarter, boosted by a 69% surge in U.S. commercial clients. Better still, net income was an impressive $106 million, marking the sixth straight quarter of profitability.Yet Palantir's total commercial customer base stood at just 262 as of March 31. That leaves plenty of room for expansion, and Wall Street seems to agree. Analysts expect Palantir to grow its profits by over 85% annually over the next half-decade.2.

                        "Investing.com -- Here is your Pro Recap of the top takeaways from Wall Street analysts for the past week.InvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving rating changes.Advanced Micro DevicesWhat happened? On Monday, Morgan Stanley downgraded Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) to Equalweight with a $176 price target.What’s the full story? Morgan Stanley acknowledges AMD’s strengthening position within its core markets. However, the analysts express caution due to the high expectations surrounding AMD’s AI capabilities, which may challenge the company’s justification for a premium valuation. Despite previous discussions by Morgan Stanley regarding these concerns—particularly since the GTC event—the team believes that investor expectations have not fully accounted for the potential effects of Nvidia’s Blackwell launch on its competitors.As AMD’s stock has experienced a rally post-quarter and is nearing Morgan Stanley’s price target, the firm has decided to adopt a more reserved stance. The research team is shifting its focus towards Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) as a preferable large-cap AI investment alternative, ranking it second in preference, following a reassessment of AMD’s market position and potential in light of the upcoming industry developments.Equalweight at Morgan Stanley means “The stock's total return is expected to be in line with the average total return of the analyst's industry (or industry team's) coverage universe, on a risk-adjusted basis, over the next 12-18 months. “How did the stock react? AMD opened the regular session at $162.75 and closed at $160.34, a gain of 4.49% from the prior day's regular close.Cleveland-CliffsWhat happened? On Tuesday, JPMorgan downgraded Cleveland-Cliffs Inc (NYSE:CLF) to Neutral with a $17 price targetWhat’s the full story? JPMorgan moved to the sidelines given the rising capex needs, replenished auto inventories, resulting in less incremental pull-through demand, and no near-term growth projects. The bank appreciates the now cleaned up balance sheet and greater focus on shareholder returns.Be that as it may, JPMorgan feels most investors would prefer cash accumulation for potential M&A rather than debt-funded buybacks. CLF’s asset mix of blast furnaces and some EAFs (electric arc furnace), combined with its vertical integration into iron ore, scrap, and HBI (Hot-briquetted iron), drives a self-sufficient business model that should largely shield it from scrap tightness ahead relative to peers.Ultimately, CLF’s leverage to auto with annual fixed contract pricing can help smooth earnings through the cycle.\"Story continuesNeutral at JPMorgan means “over the duration of the price target indicated in this report, we expect this stock will perform in line with the average total return of the stocks in the Research Analyst’s, or the Research Analyst’s team’s, coverage universe.”How did the stock react? Cleveland-Cliffs opened the regular session at $15.18 and closed at $15.13, a decline of 3.32% from the prior day's regular close.Paramount GlobalWhat happened? On Wednesday, Wells Fargo downgraded Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA) to Underweight with a $9 price target.What’s the full story? Wells Fargo analysts report that Paramount Global faces near-term challenges due to potential downward revisions as management re-engages with investors, a lack of medium-term free cash flow, and a weakening digital advertising market. Long-term prospects include the elimination of smaller players in future sports distribution and intense competition for market share in streaming subscriptions and profits.The Wells analysts believe Paramount’s best opportunities lie in significant asset sales, such as Black Entertainment Television, and a strategic shift from Paramount+ towards licensing its high-quality content externally.Comparatively, Warner Bros. Discovery (NASDAQ:WBD) trades at a high-5x enterprise value to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EV/EBITDA) with similar leverage levels, but boasts a more linear business model and a richer content portfolio, including HBO and a gaming studio.The analysts have adjusted their valuation of Paramount to 6.2x EV/EBITDA, which is broken down into 4.5x EV/EBITDA for TV Media + Studios and $1.5 billion for Direct-to-Consumer. Despite criticism that this valuation falls short of studio purchase offers and is overly punitive on DTC, the analysts counter that without any mergers and acquisitions, sum-of-the-parts comparisons are irrelevant.Wells Fargo has set a new target price for Paramount at $9 and 25x price to FCF. They see a potential upside of $14 in the event of a Skydance deal and a downside risk of $6.Underweight at Wells Fargo means “Total return on stock expected to lag the Overweight- and Equal Weight-rated stocks within the analyst's coverage universe over the next 12 months. “How did the stock react? Paramount Global opened the regular session at $10.71 and closed at $11.12, a gain of 0.72% from the prior day's regular close. Mereo BioPharma Group What happened? On Thursday, well Wednesday after the regular close, Baird initiated coverage on Mereo BioPharma Group PLC ADR (NASDAQ:MREO) at Outperform with a $8 price targetWhat’s the full story? Baird observes that Mereo has strategically constructed an impressive portfolio of rare diseases through a combination of in- and out-licensing transactions. The company’s two primary assets, setrusumab and alvelestat, originate from large pharmaceutical companies (Novartis/NVS and AstraZeneca/AZN, respectively). In the brokerage’s view, each of these assets individually presents a compelling case in a rare disease area with a high level of unmet need.Looking forward, Baird anticipates growing excitement about the potential of setrusumab, especially as pivotal data is expected to emerge in late 2024 or early 2025. Additionally, the announcement of a partnership for alvelestat could serve as an unexpected positive catalyst. The analysts remain attentive to these developments and their potential impact on the rare disease market.Outperform at Baird means “Expected to outperform on a total return, risk-adjusted basis the broader U.S. equity market over the next 12 months.”How did the stock react? Mereo BioPharma opened the regular session at $3.90 and closed at $3.99, a gain of 4.18% from the prior day's regular close.ShopifyWhat happened? On Friday, Evercore upgraded Shopify Inc (NYSE:SHOP) to Outperform with a $75 price targetWhat’s the full story? Evercore has upgraded the rating of SHOP shares to Outperform, setting a price target of $75. This decision comes after a significant drop in the stock’s value, approximately 30% from its 52-week high, presenting a compelling opportunity to invest in a premier ecommerce platform. The firm maintains a robust long-term outlook for SHOP, underpinned by its expansive Total Addressable Market (TAM) estimated at around $850 billion, a formidable competitive stance, and prospects for growth in the upscale market. These factors are supported by recent channel checks, SHOP’s proven ability for innovative product development—as indicated by its increasing Attach Rate—and the forecast for a substantial increase in profitability, with Free Cash Flow margins expected to climb from the current 12% to potentially mid-to-high teens by 2026.The firm also notes that the recent downward revisions in Operating Margin projections, as reflected in the past two Earnings Per Share reports, have significantly mitigated the risks associated with SHOP shares. The market’s future expectations for Operating and FCF Margins are deemed reasonable by Evercore. Additionally, as observers of internet advertising dynamics, Evercore endorses SHOP’s strategic move to intensify its social media marketing efforts, which is anticipated to expedite its international expansion and aligns well with current marketing trends.Outperform at Evercore means “the total forecasted return is expected to be greater than the expected total return of the analyst's coverage sector.”How did the stock react? Shopify opened the regular session at $65.83 and closed at $67.67, a gain of 4.61% from the prior day's regular close.Related ArticlesStreet calls of the week: Upgrade for Shopify; downgrades for AMD, ParamountFrench election worries rekindle market memories of UK budget routThe Dutchman who gets Nike and Lego into wartime Russiaâs stores",

                        'We recently compiled a list of the 11 Best Feminist Stocks To Invest In. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stands against the other feminist stocks.With the passage of time, the role of women in the modern day workplace has slowly started to grow. In less than a century, more women not only lead companies but are also among some of the wealthiest individuals in the world. At the same time, women have demonstrated that they are equal to men when it comes to disrupting industries. One of the best examples of this phenomena is America’s best known rocket company SpaceX. While SpaceX is famous for its founder and billionaire Elon Musk, the firm’s chief operations officer and president Gwynne Shotwell has been equally responsible for its massive success in the rocket industry which has dislodged decades of monopolies held by a few defense contractors.In fact, this rising trend of women leading the charge at some of the biggest companies in the world has also generated interesting statistics when it comes to compensation. Data from Equilar shows that in 2023, out of the 341 CEOs part of the study, 25 were women. Their median pay package stood at $17.6 million, which according to Equilar, was 7.7% higher than the figure for the complete data set. At the same time, the 25 female CEOs saw five new executives added to the list when compared to 2022.Considering this, it would appear that the gender pay gap in the US appears to be narrowing. To confirm this, we’ll have to look at the pay statistics for the entire country as opposed to only S&P 500 CEOs. Well, on this front, data gathered by Pew shows that there’s a lot to be done. The research firm points out that in 2002, women earned 80% of what men were paid. Two decades later, i.e. in 2022, this stood at 82%, indicating that there’s a lot more to be done to decrease the wage gap between the two genders. However, at the same time, younger women might be changing these trends. This is because according to Pew, women aged between 25 and 34 earned 92% of their male counterparts, which is quite higher than the figure of 86% in 2002.With these details in mind, we decided to take a look at the best feminist stocks to invest in.Our MethodologyTo make our list of the best feminist stocks to invest in, we ranked publicly traded Fortune 500 companies with female CEOs by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q1 2024. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Story continuesA close up of a complex looking PCB board with several integrated semiconductor parts.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders In Q1 2024: 124CEO: Dr. Lisa T. Su Ph.D.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)’s CEO Dr. Lisa Su is widely heralded as one of the most successful executives in the semiconductor industry. Under her leadership, AMD has transformed itself from a loss making entity to a profitable company that competes with Intel on the back of product design and cost advantages. Like Intel, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is also targeting the AI industry with a diversified product portfolio. Susquehanna is also quite optimistic for Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), as it raised the firm’s share price target to $200 from $185 in June 2024 and kept a Positive rating on the shares. The firm shared that Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) has gained market share in the PC and data center markets, and that it can continue to benefit from Intel’s manufacturing woes.A classic growth stock, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)’s forward price to earnings ratio of 46.73 is more than twice the market’s 21. This implies that investors continue to expect it to outpace the market in growth. Meridian Funds mentioned Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its Q4 2023 investor letter and shared:Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. is a global semiconductor chip maker specializing in central processing units (CPUs), which are considered the core component of most computing devices, and graphics processing units (GPUs), which accelerate operations running on CPUs. We invested in 2018 when it was a mid-cap value stock plagued by many years of underperformance due to lagging technology and lost market hishare versus competitors Intel and Nvidia. Our research identified that changes and investments made by current management under CEO Lisa Su had, over several years, finally resulted in compelling technology that positioned AMD as a stronger competitor to Nvidia and that its latest products were superior to Intel’s. We invested on the the belief that AMD’s valuation at that that time did not reflect the potential for its technology leadership to generate significant market share gains and improved profits. This thesis has been playing out for several years. During the quarter, AMD unveiled more details about its upcoming GPU products for the AI market. The stock reacted positively to expectations that AMD’s GPU servers will be a viable alternative to Nvidia. Although we pared back our exposure to AMD into strength as part of our risk-management practice, we maintained a position in the stock. We believe AMD will continue to gain share in large and growing markets and is reasonably valued relative to the potential for significantly higher earnings.Overall AMD ranks 1st on our list of the best feminist stocks to buy. You can visit 11 Best Feminist Stocks To Invest In to see the other feminist stocks that are on hedge funds\' radar. While we acknowledge the potential of AMD as an AI play, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock. READ NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion "Opportunity" for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in June. Disclosure: None.

                        'Is it too late for investors to jump on the Nvidia bandwagon? Maybe, but there are some alternative stocks that may offer good value. - MarketWatch photo illustration/iStockphotoNvidia Corp.’ s stock has returned 162% this year through Thursday with dividends reinvested, while it has more than tripled from a year ago.Does this mean it is too late for you as an investor to jump on the bandwagon? It might. But in lieu of this, there are some alternative stocks that may offer good value, as you’ll find listed below.Most Read from MarketWatch‘She won’t be happy until he’s in a homeless shelter’: My sister wants our father to refinance his $1.2 million home to pay off her $120,000 debt‘We get a raw deal’: I had the worst Father’s Day ever — and it’s a cautionary tale for other happy families‘He always managed to play golf’: My husband of 14 years never worked and now we’re divorcing.

What can I do?GameStop investors ask about company path, capital raising at rescheduled annual shareholder meeting‘He’s planning to bleed me dry’: My husband turned into a monster after we married. I own a $1.3 million home. How do I save myself and my finances?Then again, this all depends on your opinion. Nvidia NVDA doesn’t yet face significant competition for graphics processing units (GPU) being implemented by data centers to support their corporate clients’ efforts to develop new artificial-intelligence technologies. How long might this continue?“This is the biggest question the market has,” according to Greg McCullough, who co-manages the Putnam Large Cap Growth Fund PGOYX. In an interview with MarketWatch last month, MCullough noted that a year earlier, there had been some concern among investors that Nvidia might not be able to maintain its incredible growth pace. “We are past that concern now,” he said.During the same interview, McCullough’s colleague Richard Bodzy said that he expected increased competition, but also said that a “first-mover advantage, incumbency and new-technology innovation should allow Nvidia to maintain [its] leadership position.” He added that the Putnam Large Cap Growth Fund was also holding shares of Advanced Micro Devices Inc. AMD and Broadcom Inc. AVGONvidia reported sales of $26.04 billion for its fiscal quarter ended April 28, which was an increase of 18% from the previous quarter and up 262% from a year earlier. The year-over-year comparison might not be meaningful, as the company is essentially dominating the new-GPU category.Read: As Nvidia’s stock split takes effect, this stat shows how far it’s comeNvidia’s incredible growth pace has led to a dramatic increase in its stock price. There are various ways to measure a stock’s valuation. One common way of doing so is to divide the current price by the consensus estimate for earnings per share over the next 12 months. On this basis, Nvidia’s stock appears to be expensive. But let’s take a closer look at that ratio, while comparing it to the weighted forward price-to-earnings ratio for the S&P 500 SPX:Story continuesCompany or indexForward P/EForward P/E one year agoYear-over-year increase in rolling 12-month consensus EPS estimateNvidia Corp.43.348.3256.4%S&P 50020.819.112.4%Source: FactSetOne might argue that you get what you pay for. Nvidia’s stock appeared to be expensive on a forward P/E basis a year ago, and now its valuation by this measure has declined, while that of the S&P 500 has increased. In other words, Nvidia’s share price hasn’t increased as rapidly as its rolling consensus EPS estimate.A consistent “beat-and-raise pattern,” with companies exceeding quarterly estimates among analysts working for brokerage firms, can support rising share prices over time. Analysts react to the reports and to companies’ guidance by increasing their earnings estimates and price targets. This pattern has been ongoing for Nvidia.Screening for other companies expected to rival Nvidia for growthWith so much growth already baked in, let’s look further ahead. We can use consensus estimates for calendar years, as adjusted by FactSet. This makes for a uniform data set, which is useful because about 20% of companies in the S&P 500 have fiscal years that don’t match the calendar.To focus on expected rapid growth, let’s look at sales estimates. Profits for any one year can be affected by one-time events or accounting adjustments. A rapid grower also might not be profitable.Consensus estimates for annual revenue through 2026 are available from FactSet for 480 companies in the S&P 500. Here are the 20 companies expected to show the highest compound annual growth rates (CAGR) for revenue from 2024 through 2026. The table also includes expected growth rates for earnings per share, as well as forward P/E ratios (again, based on current share prices and 12-month EPS estimates) and those a year earlier. It also includes one-year returns with dividends reinvested.CompanyTickerTwo-year estimated sales CAGR through 2026Two-year estimated EPS CAGR through 2026Forward P/EForward P/E one year agoOne-year stock return through June 13Enphase Energy Inc.ENPH33.2%47.0%32.928.0-28%EQT Corp.EQT26.4%84.8%16.011.316%Nvidia Corp.NVDA25.8%26.1%43.348.3233%Moderna Inc.MRNA24.9%-46.6%N/AN/A-32%Diamondback Energy Inc.FANG24.3%3.8%9.56.850%Advanced Micro Devices Inc.AMD23.6%43.1%35.736.277%First Solar Inc.FSLR21.9%47.3%16.220.2-12%ServiceNow Inc.NOW20.8%21.6%49.552.463%Take-Two Interactive Software Inc.TTWO20.8%83.1%42.731.923%Teradyne Inc.TER20.7%43.3%37.231.05%Eli Lilly and Co.LLY20.5%35.5%54.643.7105%Axon Enterprise IncAXON20.4%21.2%57.858.040%Tesla Inc.TSLA19.4%34.5%63.964.3-5%CoStar Group Inc.CSGP18.5%86.2%81.160.232%DexCom Inc.DXCM18.3%24.1%57.598.919%Monolithic Power Systems Inc.MPWR18.1%22.5%54.742.142%Insulet Corp.PODD17.7%23.7%58.4158.9-45%Blackstone Inc.BX17.0%20.3%22.717.954%Lam Research Corp.LRCX16.6%21.7%28.624.295%Palo Alto Networks Inc.PANW16.5%12.7%51.847.843%An “N/A” for P/E means the earnings estimate in the denominator is (or was) negative.Nvidia ranks third on this list. Considering that its stock was trading at a high P/E a year ago — as well as how much it has gone up since then, and the fact that its P/E is a bit lower now — it might not be too late to buy Nvidia. And if you hold shares in an index fund, you are already a major investor. For example, Nvidia makes up 7% of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY.Nobody knows how long Nvidia can maintain this growth pace, as it maintains a lock on the GPU market and other companies are spending heavily on AI-technology development. Even professional money managers cannot predict how the AI trend will play out. If you have a strong opinion about AI, it might help you to make a good decision about Nvidia.AMD is an example of a large company on the list that is expected to grow sales at a rapid clip through 2026, with a P/E that is lower than Nvidia’s. AMD’s P/E is also a bit lower than it was a year ago — this is another case where the share price hasn’t increased as quickly as the consensus EPS estimate.It is interesting to see Tesla on the list. The stock has fallen 27% this year, but it is down only moderately from a year ago, and the company ranks 13th among the S&P 500 with an expected two-year sales CAGR of 19.4% through 2026.

mccullough  who co manages the putnam large cap growth fund pgoyx  in an interview with marketwatch last month  mcullough noted that a year earlier  there had been some concern among investors that nvidia might not be able to maintain its incredible growth pace   we are past that concern now   he said during the same interview  mccullough s colleague richard bodzy said that he expected increased competition  but also said that a  first mover advantage  incumbency and new technology innovation should allow nvidia to maintain  its  leadership position   he added that the putnam large cap growth

of doing so is to divide the current price by the consensus estimate for earnings per share over the next 12 months  on this basis  nvidia s stock appears to be expensive  but let s take a closer look

                        "Roughly three decades ago, the advent of the internet changed the growth trajectory for corporate America. Since then, numerous new technologies, innovations, and next-big-thing trends have come along promising to be the greatest thing since sliced bread. However, none have come close to matching the game-changing potential that connecting the world via the internet brough to the table... until now.The arrival of artificial intelligence (AI) opens an unlimited number of doors in virtually every sector and industry. When discussing \"AI,\" I'm talking about the use of software and systems for tasks that would normally be overseen or undertaken by humans. Giving software and systems the ability to learn and evolve over time without human intervention is what gives AI such broad-reaching utility.Image source: Getty Images.Based on a report released last year by the analysts at PwC, AI can add an estimated $15.7 trillion to the global economy by the turn of the decade. That's an enormous amount of money and a pie large enough to allow for multiple winners.But for the moment, no company has been a bigger AI winner than semiconductor company Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA).Nvidia has ridden its competitive advantages to a much-needed stock splitIn short order, Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) have become the standard in high-compute data centers. According to a study conducted by semiconductor analysis company TechInsights, Nvidia was responsible for shipping 3.76 million of the 3.85 million GPUs for AI-accelerated data centers in 2023. That's a cool 98% market share and effectively borders on a monopoly.There's absolutely no question AI-driven businesses want Nvidia's GPUs in their data centers to help train large language models (LLMs) and oversee generative AI solutions. This is plainly evident when considering that about 40% of Nvidia's net sales are derived from \"Magnificent Seven\" members Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet. During Meta's first quarter, the company announced plans to increase its capital expenditures, with the express idea of springboarding its AI ambitions.Having the first-mover advantage has also fueled Nvidia's pricing power. Demand for the company's H100 GPU has completely overwhelmed its ability to meet orders. Even with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing beefing up its chip-on-wafer-on-substrate capacity, Nvidia can't satisfy all of its customers. As a result, it's been able to dramatically increase the selling price on its GPUs, which led to a scorching-hot gross margin of 78.4% during the fiscal first quarter (ended April 28).Story continuesNvidia's first-mover advantages in AI-accelerated data centers, coupled with the mountain of cash flow it's generating from its high-priced H100 GPUs, is helping to support ongoing innovation, as well. In March, the company unveiled its Blackwell GPU architecture, which is designed to further accelerate computing capacity in data processing, quantum computing, and generative AI.Earlier this month, CEO Jensen Huang unveiled Nvidia's newest AI architecture, which is named \"Rubin.\" Rubin will be helping to train LLMs and operate on a new central processor known as \"Vera.\" While Blackwell is expected to make it into customers' hands later this year, Rubin won't be making its official debut on a commercial scale until 2026.This combination of innovation, first-mover advantages, and otherworldly pricing power, has sent Nvidia's share price soaring by more than 700% since the start of 2023. With the company's shares recently running to well over $1,000 per share, its board of directors approved and executed a 10-for-1 stock split. Nvidia joined more than a half-dozen other high-flying companies in conducting a stock split in 2024.On paper, you couldn't ask for a more perfect sales ramp-up than what Nvidia has offered. But when things seem too good to be true on Wall Street, they almost always are.Image source: Getty Images.Even if Nvidia maintains its compute advantages, shareholders can still loseAs an investor, you should be seeking out businesses that have well-defined competitive advantages, if not impenetrable moats. At the very least, Nvidia accounting for 98% of AI-GPUs shipped during 2023 lands it in the former category.But even if Nvidia retains its competitive GPU advantages, it may not be enough to keep its stock from eventually tumbling.For example, it's well-documented that Nvidia is set to face its first real bout of external competition from the likes of Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD). Intel's AI-accelerating Gaudi 3 chip will be broadly shipping to customers during the third quarter. Intel claims that Gaudi 3 has inference and energy efficiency advantages over Nvidia's H100.Meanwhile, AMD is ramping up production of its MI300X AI-GPU, which is designed as a direct competitor to Nvidia's highly successful H100. The MI300X is superior to the Nvidia H100 in memory-intensive tasks, such as simulations.Even if Blackwell and Rubin ultimately blow Intel's and AMD's chips out of the proverbial water on the basis of compute capacity, GPU scarcity suggests Intel and AMD can still be big-time winners. A significant backlog of Nvidia's chips should roll out the red carpet to external competitors like Intel and AMD.And it's not just external competitors that are a potential problem for Nvidia. The company's aforementioned top customers, which comprise around 40% of its sales, are all internally developing AI-GPUs for their data centers. This includes Microsoft's Azure Maia 100 chip, Alphabet's Trillium chip, Amazon's Trainium2 chip, and the Meta Training and Inference Accelerator (MTIA) from social media juggernaut Meta Platforms.Are these AI chips currently a threat to Nvidia's compute advantage? No. But their mere presence as complements to the H100 GPU removes valuable data center \"real estate\" and signals that Nvidia's top customers are purposefully lessening their reliance on the AI kingpin.With more AI-GPUs becoming available from Intel and AMD, and many of the Magnificent Seven internally developing AI chips, the GPU scarcity that has lifted Nvidia's pricing power into the stratosphere is going to ebb. The company's 75.5% adjusted gross margin forecast (+/- 50 basis points) for the fiscal second quarter -- a decline of 235 to 335 basis points from the sequential quarter -- likely signals that these pressures are taking hold.NVDA Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) ChartFurthermore, every next-big-thing technology, innovation, or trend over the last three decades has succumbed to an early-stage bubble-bursting event. Investors have consistently overestimated how quickly a new technology, innovation, or trend would be adopted by businesses and/or consumers.Although AI looks like the second coming of the internet in terms of changing the growth arc for corporate America, most businesses have no well-defined game plans for how they're going to deploy the technology to improve sales and profits. We see this overzealousness repeated cycle after cycle with next-big-thing investments.Mind you, this doesn't mean Nvidia won't be wildly successful over the long run or that its stock can't further increase in value when looking back 10 or 20 years from now. But it does suggest that, even if Nvidia maintains its competitive GPU advantage, the immaturity of the technology in its early stages has set Wall Street up for another bubble.The leader of every next-big-thing innovation for three decades has seen its share price eventually decline by at least 50%. I believe Nvidia's shareholders are on track to suffer this same disappointment.Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

                        "We recently published a list of 10 Biggest AI Stories and Ratings Updates You Should Not Miss This Week. Since Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) ranks 6th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.The Federal Reserve now expects just one rate cut in this year, and the market’s reaction to this development has been calmer-than-expected, showing investors are now paying little to no attention to what the Fed does and instead have their eyes focused on AI, which continues to push the markets higher. Tech companies, small and large, are continuing to roll out AI-focused products and solutions, while funds are pouring billions into AI.  SoftBank has recently committed another $5 billion in AI investments for 5 companies ($1 billion each). A Wall Street Journal report cited SoftBank’s CFO, who said the bank’s chief Masayoshi Son was taking a “break from quarterly earnings meetings so he could focus on AI.”In this backdrop it’s important to stay ahead of the curve and see what’s happening in the AI space.In this article we will take a look at some of the biggest AI stock ratings updates and stories which can’t be missed. We focused on AI stocks that are popular among the smart money investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).A robotic arm holding a semiconductor chip, emphasizing the precision and quality of the company's production equipment.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 124Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) shares recently slipped after Morgan Stanley’s Joseph Moore downgraded the stock to Equalweight from Overweight, saying the Street’s expectations from Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AMD) AI business are “too high.” The analyst went on the say that Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is expensive when compared to peers like NVDA and AVGO. However, the analyst retained his $176 price target on the stock.Average analyst estimate for Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is $187.2, which presents an upside potential of 17%. Wall Street analysts expect Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) to grow 32.50% this year and 59% next year. For the next five years the growth will then moderate to 32% on a per-annum basis, which is still high. Based on Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AMD) 2025 EPS forecast, the stock is trading at around 28.6X forward P/E ratio, which isn’t high given Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AMD) growth trajectory and catalysts.Story continuesMeridian Contrarian Fund stated the following regarding Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a global semiconductor chip maker specializing in central processing units (CPUs), which are considered the core component of most computing devices, and graphics processing units (GPUs), which accelerate operations running on CPUs. We invested in 2018 when it was a mid-cap value stock plagued by many years of underperformance due to lagging technology and lost market hi share versus competitors Intel and Nvidia. Our research identified that changes and investments made by current management under CEO Lisa Su had, over several years, finally resulted in compelling technology that positioned AMD as a stronger competitor to Nvidia and that its latest products were superior to Intel’s. We invested on the the belief that AMD’s valuation at that that time did not reflect the potential for its technology leadership to generate significant market share gains and improved profits. This thesis has been playing out for several years. During the quarter, AMD unveiled more details about its upcoming GPU products for the AI market. The stock reacted positively to expectations that AMD’s GPU servers will be a viable alternative to Nvidia. Although we pared back our exposure to AMD into strength as part of our risk-management practice, we maintained a position in the stock. We believe AMD will continue to gain share in large and growing markets and is reasonably valued relative to the potential for significantly higher earnings.”Overall, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) ranks 6th on Insider Monkey’s list titled 10 Biggest AI Stories and Ratings Updates You Should Not Miss This Week. While we acknowledge the potential of AMD, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.Disclosure: None.

                        'Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NASDAQGS. The recent rally in share prices has nudged the company in the right direction, though it still falls short of its yearly peak. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Today we will analyse the most recent data on Advanced Micro Devices’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists. See our latest analysis for Advanced Micro Devices What Is Advanced Micro Devices Worth?Advanced Micro Devices appears to be overvalued by 40% at the moment, based on our discounted cash flow valuation. The stock is currently priced at US$160 on the market compared to our intrinsic value of $114.43. This means that the opportunity to buy Advanced Micro Devices at a good price has disappeared! If you like the stock, you may want to keep an eye out for a potential price decline in the future. Since Advanced Micro Devices’s share price is quite volatile, this could mean it can sink lower (or rise even further) in the future, giving us another chance to invest. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.Can we expect growth from Advanced Micro Devices?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Advanced Micro Devices. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? AMD’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading above its fair value. At this current price, shareholders may be asking a different question – should I sell? If you believe AMD should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards its real value can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on AMD for a while, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its true value, which means there’s no upside from mispricing. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for AMD, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.Story continuesIt can be quite valuable to consider what analysts expect for Advanced Micro Devices from their most recent forecasts.

                        "We recently compiled the list of the 15 Best Hardware Stocks According To Goldman Sachs using the latest sentiment data. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stands against the other hardware stocks.The soaring popularity of artificial intelligence for consumer and business applications has injected fresh life into the computing industry. If we're to rewind the hands of time and go back to 2022, the stock market environment was considerably different from what it is now. All major technology stocks, including those that are responsible for making chips that power AI workloads were down by double digit percentages in the wake of breakneck inflation and rising interest rates.Fast forward to 2024 and the rise in valuations seems to have no end in sight. One bank that's quite optimistic about artificial intelligence is Goldman. Goldman's analyst teams are among the best in the world, and they spend countless hours analyzing stocks and industries for the right set of picks that could disrupt the industry.On this front, Goldman came out with a note recently that outlined a new beginning for the computer hardware industry. According to the bank, the introduction of AI has necessitated a global shift to new hardware that can support the technology. In its note, the bank's analysts shared:During the pandemic, the tech hardware industry peaked as the majority of work-from-home employees purchased equipment. The space currently has fully unwind this cycle and we notice stocks like HPQ trading at 9x their 2025 earnings estimates.Most PCs purchased during the pandemic are expected to be replaced soon. We expect discernable new features of AI, enhanced security, and stronger computational power in upcoming PC and mobile device models, incentivizing the US consumer to spend more on newer equipment than historically, creating an unusually stronger cycle.Goldman also created a basket of stocks where the highest weighted stock has an 8% weight and there are 20 stocks in the basket. According to Goldman analyst Faris Mourad:The basket is composed of technology hardware stocks that may benefit from PC and mobile device renovations that could include AI features. The basket can trade up to $250m in one day with no name exceeding 10% of ADV.Considering this optimism, we decided to take a look at the top Goldman's top 15 hardware stock picks.Our MethodologyTo make our list of the top Goldman Sachs hardware stocks, we used the top holdings of the bank's PC & Mobile Device AI Upgrades basket (GSXUPCAI).Story continuesFor these hardware stocks, we also mentioned hedge fund investors. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).12. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders In Q1 2024: 124 Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is the well known computer processor and graphics card company. However, despite its rapid growth and a diverse portfolio for AI, Morgan Stanley was out with a worrying note in June 2024. In the note, the bank downgraded Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)'s shares to Equalweight from Overweight and ascribed a $176 share price target. Morgan Stanley believes that the competition in the high end AI accelerator market is tough particularly due to strong products from NVIDIA. This has led it to conclude that any market that Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) can capture is reflected in the stock, and the shares might not be fast growers in the future.When it comes to the forward P/E, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)'s ratio of 46.95 is more than double the market's ratio. This implies investor expectations of a faster growth when compared to the market. Meridian Funds was quite optimistic in its Q4 2023 investor letter too, where it shared:We invested in 2018 when it was a mid-cap value stock plagued by many years of underperformance due to lagging technology and lost market share versus competitors Intel and Nvidia. Our research identified that changes and investments made by current management under CEO Lisa Su had, over several years, finally resulted in compelling technology that positioned AMD as a stronger competitor to Nvidia and that its latest products were superior to Intel’s. We invested on the the belief that AMD’s valuation at that that time did not reflect the potential for its technology leadership to generate significant market share gains and impBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)'s roved profits. This thesis has been playing out for several years. During the quarter, AMD unveiled more details about its upcoming GPU products for the AI market. The stock reacted positively to expectations that AMD’s GPU servers will be a viable alternative to Nvidia. Although we pared back our exposure to AMD into strength as part of our risk-management practice, we maintained a position in the stock. We believe AMD will continue to gain share in large and growing markets and is reasonably valued relative to the potential for significantly higher earnings.Overall, AMD ranks 12th among the 15 best hardware stocks to buy according to famed investment bank. You can visit the 15 Best Hardware Stocks According To Goldman to see the other hardware stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AMD as an AI investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock. READ NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.Disclosure: None. The article was originally published at Insider Monkey.",

the bank downgraded advanced micro devices  inc   nasdaq amd  s shares to equalweight from overweight and ascribed a  176 share price target  morgan stanley believes that the competition in the high end ai accelerator market is tough particularly due to strong products from nvidia  this has led it to conclude that any market that advanced micro devices  inc   nasdaq amd  can capture is reflected

was a mid cap value stock plagued by many years of underperformance due to lagging technology and lost market share versus competitors intel and nvidia  our research identified that changes and investments made by current management under ceo lisa su had  over several years  finally resulted in compelling technology that positioned amd as a stronger competitor to nvidia and that its latest products were superior to intel s  we invested on the the belief that amd s valuation at that that time did not reflect the potential for its technology leadership to generate significant market share

                        'Apple, Nvidia Secure Future with Taiwan Semi\'s Advanced Chips as AI Demand SoarsApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Qualcomm Inc (NASDAQ:QCOM), Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) have almost fully booked Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd\'s (NYSE:TSM) 3nm chip production process until 2026, reflecting the artificial intelligence frenzy.This demand spike reflects the rapid evolution of AI technology, pushing TSMC to innovate further in advanced manufacturing, TechNode reports.N3E, which started mass production last quarter, targets AI accelerators, high-end smartphones, and data centers. N3P, scheduled for mass production later this year, will cater to mobile devices and consumer electronics. It will likely be the standard by 2026.To accommodate the growing demand, TSMC plans to convert some 5nm equipment to enhance 3nm production capacity, potentially increasing 3nm wafer production to between 120,000 and 180,000 units monthly. TSMC stock is trading higher on Thursday.The contract chipmaker remains engaged in expanding its geographical presence beyond Taiwan. Recent reports indicated that TSMC is looking to recruit 2,000 employees in Europe, coinciding with its plans to construct a Dresden wafer fab.Also, TSMC has significantly beaten leading Chinese chipmaker Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC), bagging a market share of 62% in the first quarter. It clocked a 30% sales growth in May, reaching $7.1 billion, as the intense demand for AI refuses to fizzle out anytime soon.Taiwan Semiconductor stock gained 62% in the last 12 months. Investors can gain exposure to the semiconductor sector via First Trust Exchange-Traded Fund VIII First Trust Active Global Quality Income ETF (NYSE:AGQI) and First Trust S-Network Electric & Future Vehicle Ecosystem ETF (NASDAQ:CARZ).Price Action: TSM shares were trading higher by 0.99% to $174.70 premarket at the last check on Thursday.Disclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.Photo by Ivan Marc via Shutterstock"ACTIVE INVESTORS\' SECRET WEAPON" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 "news & everything else" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!Get the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?TAIWAN SEMICONDUCTOR (TSM): Free Stock Analysis ReportThis article Apple, Nvidia Secure Future with Taiwan Semi\'s Advanced Chips as AI Demand Soars originally appeared on Benzinga.com© 2024 Benzinga.com.

                        "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is one of the highest-returning stocks in recent years. A $1,000 investment 10 years ago is worth a staggering $247,000 today. Even if you had waited until five years ago to invest the $1,000, you could now sell those shares for $33,000.Moreover, investing in Nvidia stock has meant continuing to defy bears with its dominance of the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market and relentless stock price growth. Investors tend to earn higher overall returns when they allow winners to keep winning. Hence, suggestions that one should sell shares under such circumstances may seem counterintuitive.Nonetheless, even the highest-conviction growth stocks tend to either plateau or turn negative over time. Here are three good reasons you may want to reduce the size of your Nvidia position and take some profits.1. Reducing riskFirst of all, if you've earned returns of tenfold or more, congratulations. Such a milestone usually takes years in some of the best growth stocks, if it occurs at all.However, sometimes, the most challenging part of investing is managing winners. Some, like Amazon, continue to build on a decades-long track record of growth. Conversely, one-time darlings like Cisco Systems have yet to return to all-time highs achieved decades ago. Hence, while you want your winners to keep winning, defining what is a \"winner\" is not always easy.The compromise may be to sell enough stock to recover your original investment, especially if you've earned a tenfold gain or more. This reduces your risk of net losses on Nvidia to zero. Also, if the sale is 10% or less of your Nvidia position, it positions you to continue achieving considerable returns from Nvidia should it keep moving higher.2. DiversificationRecovering your original seed money also presents an opportunity to build a more diversified portfolio. Investment experts tend to encourage diversification in individual stocks, because failing to do so leaves an investor highly reliant on the performance of one company.If you're up tenfold or more on Nvidia, it is probably a large part of your portfolio. Even if it made up 2% or 3% of your portfolio originally, it could make up the majority of your investments now, depending on your portfolio's performance.Such conditions justify reducing one's dependence on Nvidia. Still, the process is as much art as it is science.One example is Bill Ackman's Pershing Square fund and its investment in Chipotle Mexican Grill. Since the end of 2016, Pershing Square's Chipotle position has fallen from around 2.9 million shares to 744,000 as of the end of the first quarter.Story continuesBy selling so many shares, Pershing Square missed out on massive gains. However, since Chipotle is still 20% of its portfolio, that was arguably the price of reducing dependence on one stock.Ultimately, your specific allocation comes down to your comfort level with both Nvidia and risk in general. Nonetheless, if you are inclined to sell to increase diversification, now is likely a good time to do so.3. ValuationValuations also make now a good time to diversify.Admittedly, this can be difficult because valuations say different things. In Nvidia's first quarter of fiscal 2025 (ended April 28), net income rose 628% from year-ago levels. That translated into a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 70 and a forward P/E ratio of 44. Given the growth levels, many investors will not perceive these earnings multiples as expensive.Nonetheless, other valuation metrics point to some danger signals. Amid relentless stock price increases, the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio has risen to 38. Considering that the average P/S ratio of the S&P 500 is near historical highs at 2.9, it is hard to justify such levels even at a rapid growth pace.Moreover, Nvidia stock trades at a price-to-book value ratio of 60! In comparison, rival Advanced Micro Devices sells for under 5 times its book value. Also, even with its recent increases, Qualcomm trades for a price-to-book value ratio of under 10. Nvidia outperformed these companies, but justifying such a difference in this metric may still be difficult.Selling Nvidia stockUltimately, such difficulties highlight the challenge in managing a winner like Nvidia. As the leading AI chip company, it should remain a valuable holding for some time to come.However, the outperformance does not negate all reasons for trimming holdings. In fact, the extent of its success may give investors some reason to take such an action.In the end, you want your winners to keep winning. Still, whatever decision you make with your Nvidia stock, now is an excellent time to assess your risk tolerances, evaluate the health of your stock portfolio, and take actions to bring safety and balance to your investments.Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

                        "For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – June 13, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights AT&T T, Verizon VZ, Advanced Micro Devices AMD, Walgreens Boots Alliance WBA and Apple AAPL.Cheaper Isn't Always Better: How to Avoid the Stock Value TrapThe term “value trap” refers to a stock that has a low valuation in terms of classic fundamental metrics such as the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, pays a high dividend, yet is a poor investment that underperforms the market and is “dead money.”To understand value traps, investors should consider the old saying, “You get what you pay for.” Though my mother always taught me to be frugal as a kid, she also emphasized that I should not be cheap. For example, if you buy nice clothing made from better material, you will take care of it, enjoy it more, and it will last longer. The same applies to the stock market because, often, cheaper is not better.What Are the Signs of a Value Trap?To understand value traps, I will break down some classic signs and cover some examples to prove my points.1. “Cheap” ValuationAs I mentioned, value traps are cheap based on traditional metrics, such as price-to-earnings, price-to-sales, or price-to-book ratios. However, investors need to understand that a low valuation is not bearish but it is not necessarily bullish either. Like most investing metrics, context matters.For example, telecom giant AT&T has a valuation of 7.75, which is roughly a third of the S&P 500 Index’s 24.4 P/E.Despite the low P/E (which has been lower than the S&P 500 for years), AT&T is down 25%, while the S&P 500 is up 25% over the past five years.2. Stagnant Earnings GrowthIf AT&T is so cheap, then why are shares underperforming? The answer lies in slowing earnings growth. AT&T’s quarterly EPS was as high as $0.90 in 2019 but it has steadily declined to $0.55 last quarter.3. Industry Out of FavorA stock’s industry group plays a critical role in its performance. AT&T is not the only stock performing poorly in the communications industry; Verizon has also performed poorly. Investors should seek disruptors and avoid legacy industries. For example, Advanced Micro Devices, a beneficiary of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, grew earnings by 159% last quarter. Amateur investors must learn that Institutional investors will pay a premium for growth, especially in bull markets.4. A High Dividend Yield Is a Trade OffNew, inexperienced investors often get sucked into buying a stock because it has a high dividend. Pharmacy company Walgreens Boots Alliance is a perfect example of why a high dividend does not ensure “safety” or steadiness in a stock. WBA pays a juicy 6% dividend, yet shares are down 46% over the past year!Story continues5. Caretaker ManagementInvestors must be vigilant regarding new management teams. All else equal, founder-led companies perform well until the founder leaves, and usually stagnate after. That’s because founders have “skin in the game” and are not afraid to take risks. Conversely, when a new CEO takes over an existing and successful company, their mindset tends to shift from growth-oriented to capital preservation-focused (or what I call caretaker management).Apple is a current example of caretaker management. With Steve Jobs at the helm, the Apple team was expected to innovate, speed up growth, and launch new products. Meanwhile, with Tim Cook as CEO of Apple, innovation has slowed, and capital preservation has become the goal. For instance, instead of trying to break into the EV market, Cook decided to sunset Apple’s EV program. Instead, the company is hoarding cash and buying back AAPL shares in an attempt to prop them up.GARP: A Happy MediumThe goal of this commentary is not to make investors avoid valuation at all but rather approach it intelligently. One method of doing this is to take a GARP (Growth at a Reasonable Price Approach). In this method, investors seek moderate growth (low double digits), with a reasonable p/e.Value Trap Caveat: Brutal Bear MarketsBuying value traps in a bull market is a sure-fire way to underperform. However, a bear market environment (which I define as the S&P below the 200-day) is a time when investors seek stability and cash-rich companies like Verizon or AT&T. As a result, investors must understand how to diagnose the market’s health.Bottom LineCheap valuations do not automatically make a stock a “value proposition.” In fact, investors who chase low valuation stocks will often get caught in value traps and underperform the market.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.Today you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.Media ContactZacks Investment Research800-767-3771 ext. 9339support@zacks.comhttps://www.zacks.comPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

                        'Investing.com -- Here are the biggest analyst moves in the area of artificial intelligence (AI) for this week.InvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today!‘AI stands for Apple Intelligence:’ D.A. Davidson upgrades Apple to BuyAnalysts at wealth management firm D.A. Davidson upgraded Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock from Neutral to Buy this week after the iPhone maker introduced its much-anticipated AI strategy.According to the firm’s analysts, “AI now stands for Apple Intelligence,” which is the name of the company’s artificial intelligence platform unveiled at the WWDC event.D.A. Davidson also lifted their price target from $200 to $230."Another Napster to iTunes moment. We believe yesterday\'s presentation rhymes with one of Apple\'s previous milestone moments — the transition of digital music from a standalone app with questionable regulatory standing (i.e. Napster) to an experience integrated into existing consumer applications (i.e. iTunes),” analysts wrote.“We believe the integration of summarization, enhanced search, multi-modality, text generation, and enhanced photo editing into the exiting ecosystem will drive much broader adoption of AI than we have seen to date,” they added.Analysts also highlighted that Apple is the first to introduce a meaningful agent capability, allowing Siri and other tools to execute tasks on behalf of the user. Moreover, they emphasize that Apple is uniquely positioned to offer these capabilities and “may be the only one capable of doing so any time soon.”AMD downgraded as Morgan Stanley favors Nvidia, BroadcomMeanwhile, AI chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) got a downgrade at Morgan Stanley on Monday, from Overweight to Equal Weight.While the bank still supports the overall narrative, it believes investor expectations for AMD\'s AI business are too high. Morgan Stanley analysts think that the current AI expectations don\'t leave room for much upside, despite a recovery in the core business.“We see limited upward revision potential for AI from here," analysts wrote.Moreover, Morgan Stanley notes that AMD appears expensive compared to other large-cap AI plays, such as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO), where the bank has more confidence in upward revisions to AI forecasts.Despite the downgrade, Morgan Stanley analysts continue to view AMD\'s product lineup as a strong competitor in the client and server CPU markets this year.Melius downgrades Adobe as enterprise software faces AI challengesEarlier in the week, Melius analysts lowered their rating on Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) stock from Buy to Hold, with a price target of $510.Story continuesThe investment firm notes that the enterprise application software sector is facing challenges with AI, drawing parallels to how on-prem hardware companies were affected by the shift to the cloud in the 2010s. They suggest this trend could persist longer than anticipated.Melius highlights that AI, enabled by companies like Nvidia and major cloud platforms, will accelerate software creation, customization, and deployment. Moreover, coding tools are allowing smaller AI-first competitors to emerge more easily.They also point out that most SaaS companies have been increasing prices for years, making it harder to charge extra for AI, and AI-driven productivity may disrupt the traditional "seat model" business approach, indicating a potential transition in business models.“Furthermore, we see AI as a disruptor to traditional databases as unstructured data rises in both importance and usability,” Melius analysts said. “In short, you could see AI\'s impact on Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW) and even parts of hold-rated Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), as well as ongoing impacts on Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) and Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) for a while."Broadcom is “one of the strongest AI plays,” Morgan Stanley saysAhead of its better-than-expected earnings report released Wednesday, Morgan Stanley reiterated its Overweight rating on Broadcom, describing the semiconductor company as "one of the strongest AI plays."The Wall Street giant pointed out several key catalysts for their positive outlook, including Broadcom’s growth prospects in AI, potential synergies from the VMware (NYSE:VMW) acquisition, and recovery in its core enterprise semiconductor businesses.The bank’s analysts project Broadcom\'s AI revenues to rise from $4.2 billion in FY2023 to $14 billion in FY2025, which would account for approximately 39% of the company\'s projected semiconductor revenues."We expect Broadcom to easily meet, if not slightly exceed, AI targets," the analysts noted. They believe Broadcom is poised to benefit from the deployment of Ethernet in AI data centers, the continued ramp-up of Google’s TPU, and the addition of two new ASIC clients.MS: Tesla could make an AI-powered phoneTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) may soon venture into the smartphone market, according to Morgan Stanley analysts.“The car is an extension of the phone. The phone is an extension of the car,” the Wall Street firm noted, based on its discussions with automotive executives and industry experts. “The lines between car and phone are truly blurring,” they added.Morgan Stanley analysts have long considered Tesla\'s potential to expand into edge computing domains beyond vehicles. In October, they emphasized the concept of a mobile AI assistant as a significant innovation.This idea resurfaced when Tesla CEO Elon Musk mentioned that developing such a device is "not out of the question" following Apple’s WWDC.“As Mr. Musk continues to invest further into his own LLM/genAI efforts, such as ‘Grok’, the potential strategic and user experience overlap becomes more obvious,” the analysts wrote.Supercomputing at both the data center and edge levels is increasingly relevant from an automotive perspective. The latest Tesla vehicles, capable of over-the-air firmware updates, contain batteries with the energy equivalent of approximately 2,000 iPhones and come equipped with liquid-cooled inference supercomputers.Morgan Stanley asked, “What if your phone could tap into your vehicle’s compute power and battery supply to run AI applications?” They pointed out that edge computing and AI have highlighted challenges like battery life, thermal management, and latency in integrating powerful AI-driven applications with today\'s smartphones.“Any Tesla owner will tell you how they use their smartphone as their primary key to unlock their car as well as running other remote applications while they interact with their vehicles,” the analysts added.Related Articles5 big analyst AI moves: Apple stock lifted to Buy as AMD, Adobe get downgradedFrench election worries rekindle market memories of UK budget routThe Dutchman who gets Nike and Lego into wartime Russiaâs stores',

                        "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:The chart of the dayWhat we're watchingWhat we're readingEconomic data releases and earningsTry to knock this king off the throne.In the days since Nvidia's (NVDA) big quarter and outlook on Wednesday night, two tracks have emerged.Track one is owned and operated by Wall Street, and it believes Nvidia will continue to speed to new profit heights this year and next. Consensus estimates (which can be tracked on Yahoo Finance here) are on the rise (again), and the Street remains steadfast in its appetite for jacked-up price targets.The other track is owned and operated by the media, and it is increasingly looking to poke holes in the Nvidia investment thesis. Hey, I get it; it's our job to be skeptical of numbers, commonly held narratives, and leaders.But to be out there peddling that Nvidia's stock is in a bubble because it's up a lot, or its financials may be in a bubble due to eye-popping growth rates, strike me as off base completely.Let me offer this up front: I have no car in this race — do not own shares of Nvidia and never have.All I am saying is that an asset bubble has a few simple characteristics.One: The asset appreciating in value usually doesn't have the fundamentals to justify said appreciation. Two: People are blindly buying the asset without understanding the asset — mainly because everyone else is going in.I don't see either of these things for Nvidia.Investors appear very knowledgeable on Nvidia's business and are buying for the correct reasons.Then, Nvidia's growth rates justify a higher valuation. This is a company that just grew earnings by 461% in the first quarter! Sales exploded 262%!Why? Because we are witnessing a seismic shift in tech stacks at the hand of generative AI, powered by models underpinned by Nvidia chips. No one is even close to this company's technology. Concerns over Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL) building their own AI chips are great to discuss, but Nvidia is doing this at scale, and is 27 miles ahead of these companies.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang makes the keynote address at Nvidia GTC in San Jose, Calif. on March 18, 2024. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\"People want to deploy these data centers right now,\" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told Yahoo Finance's Julie Hyman and Dan Howley in an exclusive interview right after earnings (video above). \"They want to put our [graphics processing units] to work right now and start making money and start saving money. And so that demand is just so strong.\"Will Nvidia keep growing its top and bottom lines by triple digits? No, but the growth rates will remain beyond impressive and faster than competitors.Story continuesBubble? Let's get real here, people!Amazon AWS has begun to make AI chips to better control a supply chain starved for these powerful pieces of technology. AWS CEO Adam Selipsky discusses the strategy in a new episode of the Opening Bid podcast. Listen in below.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

                        "Many Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) insiders ditched their stock over the past year, which may be of interest to the company's shareholders. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. Check out our latest analysis for Advanced Micro Devices The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Advanced Micro DevicesIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Executive VP & GM of Data Center Solutions Business Unit, Forrest Norrod, sold US$5.3m worth of shares at a price of US$176 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at around the current price of US$166. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. Given that the sale took place at around current prices, it makes us a little cautious but is hardly a major concern.In the last year Advanced Micro Devices insiders didn't buy any company stock. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeI will like Advanced Micro Devices better if I see some big insider buys.

In total, insiders sold US$1.7m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Insider OwnershipLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Advanced Micro Devices insiders own 0.5% of the company, currently worth about US$1.5b based on the recent share price. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About Advanced Micro Devices Insiders?Insiders sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. But it is good to see that Advanced Micro Devices is growing earnings.

                        "Chip giant Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) launched the first of its Core Ultra laptop CPUs, codenamed Meteor Lake, last December. Meteor Lake brought a bunch of changes all at once:It moved to a disaggregated architecture, with the chips split into tiles that each use a different manufacturing process.The compute tile marked the debut of the Intel 4 process, the second of five process nodes that are part of Intel's plan to retake manufacturing leadership.Meteor Lake chips include a built-in AI processor, a first for Intel in the PC market.Meteor Lake chips are packaged using Intel's Foveros advanced packaging technology.Competition comes to the laptop marketWhile Meteor Lake was a big step forward for Intel, a new competitor will give Intel a run for its money this year. Laptops powered by Qualcomm's (NASDAQ: QCOM) Arm-based processors are set to arrive in June from all the major PC OEMs as well as from Microsoft itself. Previous attempts to bring the Arm architecture to Windows have failed miserably, but this time looks different.Qualcomm's new Snapdragon X Elite and Snapdragon X Plus processors are fast and efficient. While full benchmarks of Qualcomm-powered devices aren't yet available, early benchmarks indicate that the Elite X often outperforms Meteor Lake and even Apple's M3 chip in CPU-heavy tasks. The Elite X chip reigns supreme in AI workloads thanks to its powerful AI processor, running circles around Meteor Lake.A software emulation layer will handle backward compatibility, enabling legacy Windows applications built for x86 processors to run on Qualcomm-powered devices. Emulation always introduces a performance penalty, but Qualcomm's chips may be powerful enough for this penalty to be unnoticeable by end users.Qualcomm's chips also enable significant improvements in battery life. Qualcomm claims that some laptops will be capable of delivering multiple days of battery life, although we'll have to wait for third-party reviews to see if that claim holds water.Waking a sleeping giantUp until 2017 or so when rival AMD began its comeback, Intel dominated the PC CPU market and had little reason to push the envelope. Chronic manufacturing delays didn't matter for years as its market share hovered in monopoly territory.Those days are now over, and Intel under CEO Pat Gelsinger knows it. Not only is AMD gaining market share, but Qualcomm and eventually other Arm-based CPU companies are coming for the PC market.Less than a year after launching Meteor Lake, Intel plans to bring its successor to market, an extremely fast cadence for Intel considering all the improvements coming. Intel's Lunar Lake chips will start shipping to OEMs in the third quarter, early enough to ensure plenty of systems are available for the holiday season.Story continuesLunar Lake uses a similar disaggregated architecture as Meteor Lake. The CPU tile is expected to be manufactured using the Intel 20A process, although that hasn't been confirmed, the penultimate process node in Intel's 5-node plan. Intel 20A will bring a new transistor design and backside power delivery, the latter of which can deliver meaningful efficiency gains. Foundry leader TSMC won't have backside power delivery until 2026.Lunar Lake will come with a supercharged AI processor, more than tripling the AI compute capacity of Meteor Lake. Upgraded graphics will contribute more AI horsepower, and Intel's work on its AI software ecosystem could give it an edge.Intel can't afford to move slowly with competition brewing in the PC CPU market. Meteor Lake chips are selling well, although capacity constraints are currently hindering sales. However, Meteor Lake may be outclassed by Qualcomm's new chips once they launch. Thankfully, Intel will have an answer before the end of the year with Lunar Lake.Intel may never be as dominant as it once was in the PC CPU market as Arm-based chips gain a foothold, but if the company can maintain its momentum and bring new architectures to market and new manufacturing processes online in quick succession, it can remain the market leader in the age of the AI PC.Should you invest $1,000 in Intel right now?Before you buy stock in Intel, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Intel wasn’t one of them.

                        "Microsoft recently announced that it would offer its cloud computing customers the option of using MI300X artificial intelligence (AI) chips made by Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD). Microsoft will offer clusters of MI300X chips through its Azure cloud computing service as an alternative to Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) H100 graphic processing units (GPUs).Given this announcement, is it time to dump Nvidia stock in favor of AMD?The simple answer is no. Expanding on that answer, it might be a good time to buy both stocks -- and another beneficiary as well.Why Microsoft started offering AMD chipsMicrosoft isn't offering cloud customers the option of AMD GPUs as a knock on Nvidia's GPUs, which have become the industry standard for helping power AI applications in the data center. The issue is that Nvidia's chips are so popular that it is becoming difficult for companies to get hold of them. This isn't a bad problem to have.Both Nvidia and AMD are having difficulty keeping up with demand for their GPUs. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), the world's largest semiconductor manufacturer, said that its advanced packaging capacity is fully booked for both the rest of this year and next. It's presumed this is due to demand for GPUs from both Nvidia and AMD, which are both top-10 customers of the company.TSCM is working to aggressively expand its production capacity to meet AI and other high-performance computing (HPC) chip demand. The company now plans to build a third fabrication facility (fab) in Arizona after its first facility in the state just began wafer production. It also just completed its first specialty technology fab in Japan and announced a second in the country to be completed by the end of 2027. It is also building a fab in Germany for automotive and industrial applications, scheduled to start construction late this year.TSMC is also looking to fully develop its 2-nanometer chip technology. Within the semiconductor industry, as technology moves to smaller nodes (semiconductor sizes), more chips can fit on a wafer, which increases production capacity and lowers costs.However, until this technology and fab expansion take hold, the market for GPUs looks like it will remain tight.Image source: Getty ImagesTime to buy Nvidia, AMD, and TSMCInstead of dumping Nvidia, now could be a great time for investors to buy both Nvidia and AMD stock, as well as TSMC. The demand for high-performance computing chips and GPUs is massive, and the industry is currently struggling to meet demand.Nvidia remains the clear leader, and its growth has been nothing short of spectacular. The company long ago became the GPU industry standard before the advent of AI through its CUDA software platform, which allows its GPUs to be programmed directly. At this point, the company can likely sell as many chips as its foundry partners can produce. These days most semiconductor companies don't own their own manufacturing facilities, and instead use contract manufacturers like TSCM.Story continuesAMD, meanwhile, is a nice beneficiary of a very tight GPU market. With its Q1 results, the company just raised its expected full-year data center GPU revenue from $3.5 billion to $4.0 billion. And with Nvidia GPUs difficult to get, AMD has the opportunity to make inroads into this market and become a viable number-two player. Companies generally don't like to rely too heavily on one supplier, so the current market dynamics could give AMD a longer-lasting boost if its chips are well received.TSCM, meanwhile, is a prime beneficiary of GPU and chip demand, as companies race to get these chips to power AI applications. By adding additional fabs and moving to 2-nanometer technology, TSCM is set to benefit from the AI chip boom. It also will benefit as other companies jump on board. For example, it has been reported that Arm Holdings and Softbank have been looking to design an AI chip, while companies like Amazon have gotten into the AI chip business as well. Apple executives, meanwhile, have been reported to have met with TSMC to reserve 2-nanometer production to help it catch up in AI. This all benefits TSMC.When looking at valuations, TSMC is the cheapest stock, trading at about 24 times forward P/E. It is even cheaper on an enterprise value-to-EBITDA basis, trading near 13 times. This metric takes into consideration its net debt position and takes out non-cash expenses.TSM PE Ratio (Forward) ChartNvidia, meanwhile, trades at a forward P/E of 37, and 32 on an EV/EBITDA basis. Given its growth, this is an inexpensive valuation.AMD is the most expensive stock of the group, trading at a forward P/E of over 47 and an EV/EBITDA multiple of over 50. However, the company has not yet seen the potential AI chip inflection point that the other two companies have, so it still holds potential.In order of preference at this time, Nvidia would be my first choice, closely followed by TSMC, and then AMD. However, all three stocks hold strong long-term potential.Should you invest $1,000 in Advanced Micro Devices right now?Before you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Advanced Micro Devices wasn’t one of them.

                        "Believe it or not, old mobile-chip giant Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) has been a hot stock so far in 2024. After getting clobbered in the aftermath of the pandemic-era consumer electronics spending spree, shares have rallied to all-time highs and are up nearly 40% so far this year.There's good reason for this stock price jump. Though the smartphone market is likely to remain tepid, Qualcomm has developed two newer consumer markets that are lifting profitability higher. As a result, the stock could still be a pretty good value right now.Autos are in overdrive, and are PCs ready to rev?As I wrote a couple of months ago, Qualcomm is benefiting from a stabilization in the smartphone market this year. Though sales are far from all-out growth, Qualcomm's high-end 5G connectivity chips fetch more dollars per unit than in the past (known as average selling price, or ASP). That's leading to an outperformance of the overall smartphone market for Qualcomm's revenue.But there are even better things brewing. After years of floundering, Qualcomm's PC business might be about to shift into high gear.Its Snapdragon X Elite laptop chips are coming this summer. The Snapdragon X for Microsoft Windows laptops is based on Arm Holdings designs, the same architecture Apple uses for its top-notch MacBook lineup.Why is this significant? It represents a brand-new potential growth market for Qualcomm, which reports very little in laptop sales right now. And this is a very large space for Qualcomm to invade, one currently dominated by Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) with their x86 architecture for PC chips. Intel and AMD's PC chip revenue was $7.5 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively, in the first quarter alone.Suffice to say, just a bit of market share in PCs could lead to another incremental growth outlet for Qualcomm, just like its fledgling automotive segment has been in recent years.Qualcomm's revenue is starting to look very different from historical norms. Source: Qualcomm.It's all about marginOne of the wonderful things about Qualcomm's business model is that, even during severe cyclical downturns for its primary moneymaker (smartphones), it remains highly profitable. In the next year or two as consumer spending continues to find solid footing in the wake of turbulence from the pandemic and interest rate hikes, Qualcomm's profit margins will rally.QCOM Operating Margin (TTM) ChartAnother drain on Qualcomm's profits has been elevated investment in the PC and automotive chip businesses. As the company starts to log more-significant sales from those development efforts, that will also be a boost to profit margins.Story continuesTo be clear, Qualcomm isn't going to be the fastest-growing semiconductor business out there. But if higher ASPs on smartphone chips and new growth outlets like Windows laptops and auto chips kick in, it isn't unreasonable to expect an average low-teens growth in earnings per share (EPS) for the next few years.At 27 times trailing-12-month EPS, or 18 times free cash flow, Qualcomm still looks like a great value to me.Should you invest $1,000 in Qualcomm right now?Before you buy stock in Qualcomm, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Qualcomm wasn’t one of them.

                        "Nvidia (NVDA) stock rose 9.3% on Thursday, closing above $1,000 for the first time and giving the chip giant a market cap north of $2.5 trillion after reporting first quarter earnings that once again blew away forecasts.Nvidia's first quarter results, released after the bell on Wednesday, showed adjusted earnings per share (EPS) tallied $6.12 on revenue of $26 billion, a jump of 461% and 262%, respectively, from a year ago.The company also announced a 10-for-1 stock split and an increased dividend, following some of its Big Tech peers in doling out heftier quarterly payments to shareholders.Analysts were expecting adjusted EPS of $5.65 on revenue of $24.69 billion, according to data from Bloomberg. The company reported adjusted EPS of $1.09 on revenue of $7.19 billion in the same quarter last year.In the current quarter, Nvidia expects revenue of $28 billion, plus or minus 2%. That’s better than the $26.6 billion analysts had expected.“Our data center growth was fueled by strong and accelerating demand for generative AI training and inference on the Hopper platform,\" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement. \"Beyond cloud service providers, generative AI has expanded to consumer internet companies, and enterprise, sovereign AI, automotive and healthcare customers, creating multiple multibillion-dollar vertical markets.\"Wall Street analysts have previously raised concerns about the share of Nvidia's Data Center revenue that comes from hyperscalers like Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), and other Big Tech names. That's especially true as those companies roll out their own AI accelerator chips.In an exclusive interview with Yahoo Finance following the company's earnings report on Wednesday, Huang pushed back against concerns the company could face a demand lull as it shifts between its current and next generation of AI chips.\"People want to deploy these data centers right now,\" Huang said. \"They want to put our [graphics processing units] to work right now and start making money and start saving money. And so that demand is just so strong.\"Nvidia's Data Center revenue jumped 427% year over year to $22.6 billion, accounting for 86% of the company's total revenue for the quarter. Nvidia's gaming segment, which was previously its most important business, saw revenue of $2.6 billion. CFO Colette Kress said in a statement on Wednesday that large cloud providers accounted for around 45% of the company's Data Center revenue.In a note to clients published Thursday, JPMorgan analysts led by Harlan Sur wrote Nvidia, \"continues to maintain a 1-2 step lead ahead of competitors.\" JPMorgan raised its price target on Nvidia stock to $1,150 from $850 and reiterated an Overweight rating on shares.Story continuesOn the company's earnings call, Kress pointed out that revenue out of China was down significantly in the quarter, as the company was forced to halt shipments of its most powerful chips to the country. The company also expects the market in the region to remain very competitive going forward.The company's stock split — in which shareholders will receive 10 shares for every one share of the company they currently own — will be effective June 7, and its new dividend will be paid June 28 to shareholders as of June 11.The stock split will likely fuel speculation Nvidia could be added to the price-weighted Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), joining Big Tech peers like Apple (AAPL), Amazon, and Microsoft.Nvidia's beefed-up dividend also follows similar moves announced so far this year from the likes of Meta (META) and Alphabet, which both initiated quarterly dividends for the first time, and Apple, which raised its dividend earlier this month.NVIDIA's CEO Jensen Huang displays products on-stage during the annual Nvidia GTC Artificial Intelligence Conference at SAP Center in San Jose, Calif., on March 18, 2024.

                        "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is now the third-largest company in the world behind Apple and Microsoft, thanks to a 200% pop in its stock price over the past year, which catapulted its market cap to $2.35 trillion.Nvidia owes most of its recent success to its graphics processing units (GPUs) for use in data centers. These GPUs are designed to help developers build, train, and deploy artificial intelligence (AI) models. However the AI industry is rapidly expanding, and since many investors are laser-focused on Nvidia, they might be overlooking other exciting opportunities in the chip sector.According to The Wall Street Journal, analysts have reached a bullish consensus on Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) and Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU), both of which play an increasingly important role in the AI industry. Here's why buying shares in these two semiconductor companies might be a great idea.1. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)Nvidia's H100 GPU has been the go-to AI chip for data center operators, and demand has exploded over the past 18 months. It just started shipping the even more powerful H200 GPU, and customers are eagerly awaiting a new line of chips based on the company's latest Blackwell architecture that will launch closer to 2025. But demand continues to outstrip supply, which leaves the door open for competitors to take market share.AMD is stepping in to do just that. It's now shipping its MI300 lineup of data center chips, which come in two configurations. The MI300X is a pure GPU like the H100, and the MI300A combines GPU and central processing unit (CPU) technologies to create an accelerated processing unit (APU). The latter was chosen by the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory to power its new El Capitan supercomputer, which will advance everything from high-energy-density physics to U.S. national defense.The MI300 series has already won over many of Nvidia's biggest commercial customers, including Microsoft, Oracle, and Meta Platforms. Demand is so strong that AMD now expects to sell $4 billion worth of MI300 GPUs in 2024 (that forecast stood at $2 billion just a few months ago).But AI is quickly migrating out of the data center and onto our computers and devices, and this is a segment of the market AMD already dominates. Millions of PCs fitted with its Ryzen AI CPUs, GPUs, and neural processing units (NPUs) have already shipped, from top manufacturers like Dell and HP. By processing AI on a device, chatbots and other AI applications can answer queries more quickly, which leads to a better user experience.Story continuesRyzen AI chips are already making a noteworthy financial contribution to AMD. In the first quarter of 2024 (ended March 31), they drove AMD's client segment revenue to nearly $1.4 billion, an 85% year-over-year increase.The company views AI as the biggest inflection point for PCs since the dawn of the internet, which makes AMD stock a great long-term addition to any portfolio as the revolution unfolds.The Wall Street Journal tracks 48 analysts covering AMD stock, and 33 have given it the highest possible buy rating. A further six are in the overweight (bullish) camp, and nine recommend holding. Not one of them recommends selling. Based on some of the points highlighted above, the overwhelmingly bullish consensus isn't surprising.2. Micron TechnologyMicron doesn't produce CPUs or GPUs like AMD and Nvidia. Instead, it makes some of the industry's most sought-after memory (DRAM) and storage (NAND) chips, which are increasingly important because AI applications command more of both.In fact, Nvidia chose Micron's HBM3E (high-bandwidth memory) to power its new H200 GPU.Micron's HBM3E consumes 30% less power than competing hardware, a key consideration for data center operators. First, it keeps electricity costs down, and second, some experts believe existing U.S. power infrastructure won't be able to cope with growing demand from data centers over the next couple of years, so trimming consumption is becoming a necessity.As a result, Micron says its high-bandwidth memory is completely sold out for 2024 already, and most of its 2025 supply is also spoken for.Like AMD, Micron benefits from AI's transition into personal computers and smartphones. CEO Sanjay Mehrotra says the chipsets inside AI-enabled computers require up to 80% more DRAM capacity than those in traditional PCs, and up to double the DRAM in mobile devices. Micron's chips are already powering the new Samsung S24 (Galaxy AI) smartphone, which comes with a number of AI features including a chat assistant, new camera tools, and innovative translation software that allows two people to converse in different languages.The trend toward AI will lead to more complex and expensive chips, which is a tailwind for Micron's revenue. Speaking of which, the company generated $5.8 billion in revenue during the fiscal 2024 second quarter (ended Feb. 29), a 57% increase compared to the year-ago period. Its guidance for the upcoming third quarter (ending June 1) implies accelerated growth of 76%.Micron stock is up 52% already this year, and it's trading at an all-time high, but 28 of the 39 analysts tracked by The Wall Street Journal still rate it as a buy. Simply put, investors who think companies like Nvidia and AMD will sell copious amounts of CPUs and GPUs thanks to AI should also be bullish on Micron's prospects.

                        'nvidia  nasdaq  nvda  is now the third largest company in the world behind apple and microsoft  thanks to a 200  pop in its stock price over the past year  which catapulted its market cap to  2 35 trillion nvidia owes most of its recent success to its graphics processing units  gpus  for use in data centers  these gpus are designed to help developers build  train  and deploy artificial intelligence  ai  models  however the ai industry is rapidly expanding  and since many investors are laser focused on nvidia  they might be overlooking other exciting opportunities in the chip sector according to the wall street journal  analysts have reached a bullish consensus on advanced micro devices  nasdaq  amd  and micron technology  nasdaq  mu   both of which play an increasingly important role in the ai industry  here s why buying shares in these two semiconductor companies might be a great idea 1  advanced micro devices  amd nvidia s h100 gpu has been the go to ai chip for data center operators  and demand has exploded over the past 18 months  it just started shipping the even more powerful h200 gpu  and customers are eagerly awaiting a new line of chips based on the company s latest blackwell architecture that will launch closer to 2025  but demand continues to outstrip supply  which leaves the door open for competitors to take market share amd is stepping in to do just that  it s now shipping its mi300 lineup of data center chips  which come in two configurations  the mi300x is a pure gpu like the h100  and the mi300a combines gpu and central processing unit  cpu  technologies to create an accelerated processing unit  apu   the latter was chosen by the lawrence livermore national laboratory to power its new el capitan supercomputer  which will advance everything from high energy density physics to u s  national defense the mi300 series has already won over many of nvidia s biggest commercial customers  including microsoft  oracle  and meta platforms  demand is so strong that amd now expects to sell  4 billion worth of mi300 gpus in 2024  that forecast stood at  2 billion just a few months ago  but ai is quickly migrating out of the data center and onto our computers and devices  and this is a segment of the market amd already dominates  millions of pcs fitted with its ryzen ai cpus  gpus  and neural processing units  npus  have already shipped  from top manufacturers like dell and hp  by processing ai on a device  chatbots and other ai applications can answer queries more quickly  which leads to a better user experience story continuesryzen ai chips are already making a noteworthy financial contribution to amd  in the first quarter of 2024  ended march 31   they drove amd s client segment revenue to nearly  1 4 billion  an 85  year over year increase the company views ai as the biggest inflection point for pcs since the dawn of the internet  which makes amd stock a great long term addition to any portfolio as the revolution unfolds the wall street journal tracks 48 analysts covering amd stock  and 33 have given it the highest possible buy rating  a further six are in the overweight  bullish  camp  and nine recommend holding  not one of them recommends selling  based on some of the points highlighted above  the overwhelmingly bullish consensus isn t surprising 2  micron technologymicron doesn t produce cpus or gpus like amd and nvidia  instead  it makes some of the industry s most sought after memory  dram  and storage  nand  chips  which are increasingly important because ai applications command more of both in fact  nvidia chose micron s hbm3e  high bandwidth memory  to power its new h200 gpu micron s hbm3e consumes 30  less power than competing hardware  a key consideration for data center operators  first  it keeps electricity costs down  and second  some experts believe existing u s  power infrastructure won t be able to cope with growing demand from data centers over the next couple of years  so trimming consumption is becoming a necessity as a result  micron says its high bandwidth memory is completely sold out for 2024 already  and most of its 2025 supply is also spoken for like amd  micron benefits from ai s transition into personal computers and smartphones  ceo sanjay mehrotra says the chipsets inside ai enabled computers require up to 80  more dram capacity than those in traditional pcs  and up to double the dram in mobile devices  micron s chips are already powering the new samsung s24  galaxy ai  smartphone  which comes with a number of ai features including a chat assistant  new camera tools  and innovative translation software that allows two people to converse in different languages the trend toward ai will lead to more complex and expensive chips  which is a tailwind for micron s revenue  speaking of which  the company generated  5 8 billion in revenue during the fiscal 2024 second quarter  ended feb  29   a 57  increase compared to the year ago period  its guidance for the upcoming third quarter  ending june 1  implies accelerated growth of 76  micron stock is up 52  already this year  and it s trading at an all time high  but 28 of the 39 analysts tracked by the wall street journal still rate it as a buy  simply put  investors who think companies like nvidia and amd will sell copious amounts of cpus and gpus thanks to ai should also be bullish on micron s prospects  therefore  now might be a great time to follow wall street s lead and buy this stock should you invest  1 000 in advanced micro devices right now before you buy stock in advanced micro devices  consider this the motley fool stock advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now  and advanced micro devices wasn t one of them  the 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years consider when nvidia made this list on april 15  2005    if you invested  1 000 at the time of our recommendation  you d have  584 435  stock advisor provides investors with an easy to follow blueprint for success  including guidance on building a portfolio  regular updates from analysts  and two new stock picks each month  the stock advisor service has more than quadrupled the return of s p 500 since 2002  see the 10 stocks   stock advisor returns as of may 13  2024randi zuckerberg  a former

                        "For the first time in a long time, the battle between Macs and PCs is interesting again.Apple's (AAPL) products have been beating out Microsoft's (MSFT) Windows-based PCs for years thanks to their superior battery life and performance. But Microsoft says it’s finally tipped the scales back in its own favor.“We have more powerful silicon. We've rewritten [Windows 11] to take advantage of it. And then we have unique experiences we've built on top of that platform,” Microsoft consumer chief marketing officer Yusuf Mehdi told Yahoo Finance. “So I think we have a distinct advantage for a period of time here.”Microsoft says it’s achieved this through a new category of AI PCs it’s calling Copilot+ PCs.You’ve probably already heard about AI PCs, which are PCs that include special neural processing units (NPUs) that can run AI apps locally rather than relying on cloud-based services like ChatGPT.Copilot+ PCs include those same NPUs, but also come with a minimum of 16GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, and, importantly, run Microsoft’s Copilot AI assistant for Windows 11.Microsoft’s Copilot+ PCs come as the PC industry hopes it’s entering a period of sustained sales growth after two years of steep declines. According to IDC, PC sales grew 1.5% in the first quarter compared to a drop of 28.7% in Q1 last year.“There's no doubt in my mind that the demand is here,” Mehdi said. “And this is going to spur a purchase of PCs in ways that we haven't had before.”For the first time in decades, Mehdi added, Microsoft feels it has an edge on Apple from both a performance standpoint and because it offers “completely unique things that you can’t do anywhere else.”Windows gets GPT-4oApple is notoriously behind Microsoft in the AI race, having sat on the sidelines until very recently — though it has made sure that its hardware has extremely fast AI-ready chips.Looking to take advantage of Apple being caught on the back foot, Microsoft hopes the Copilot+, which is powered by GPT-4o, will provide a seismic productivity boost with the ability to serve as a user's go-to assistant for tasks ranging from dealing with common problems like audio issues to summarizing documents.Microsoft senior product manager Oyin Shenbanjo speaks about the new Surface Laptop in comparison with the MacBook Air M3 during a Microsoft Briefing event on May 20, 2024. (JASON REDMOND/AFP via Getty Images) (JASON REDMOND via Getty Images)Microsoft also introduced its new Copilot Recall, a feature that makes it easier to search virtually everything you’ve done on your PC, including documents, photos, and web pages. So, if you were planning a trip to Seattle but lost the site you were using to look up things to do, you can type “Seattle” into Recall, which will pull up the site you were browsing.Story continuesMicrosoft says it does this by taking a snapshot of your screen over time and then using Copilot’s visual search feature to find the content you’re looking for. The company also says content saved in Recall is only stored on your device and that you can customize which apps use the feature.Microsoft’s first Copilot+ PCs will hit the market in June starting at $999, conspicuously the same price as Apple’s MacBook Air.Performance and battery lifeWindows and Mac users may have different priorities, with many of them engrained in a specific ecosystem and unlikely to change. That is, unless perhaps fresh and exclusive AI functionality lures somebody over the fence. But they can still be put head to head.Performance benchmarks have become major talking points, and Apple’s Mac laptops have been crushing Windows-based PCs in terms of power efficiency ever since the iPhone maker rolled out its first M1 chip for MacBooks in 2020.Those Arm-based (ARM) chips have made it so MacBooks can last all day on a single charge while providing exceptional overall performance across a multitude of use cases. But Microsoft says its Windows PCs have a new weapon that puts it back in a leadership position: Qualcomm’s (QCOM) Arm-based Snapdragon X Elite and Snapdragon X Pro chips.During its announcement on Monday, the company said a Copilot+ PC running on Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X Elite chip gets 20% more battery life, 23% better peak performance, and 58% better sustained multithread performance than Apple’s MacBook Air with an M3 chip.What’s more, Mehdi said Snapdragon-powered Copilot+ PCs beat out Apple’s latest M4 chip in terms of trillions of operations per second, or TOPs, a common measurement for gauging potential AI app performance.For now, Microsoft has the edge thanks to an actual AI product. But Apple isn’t taking any of this lying down. The company will host its annual WWDC event on June 10, where it’s expected to roll out its own AI apps and services, including some that Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman says will run on OpenAI’s AI software.And as far as its MacBooks go, Apple is still likely to announce its M4 Pro and M4 Max chips, which should offer better performance than its M4 and could outpace Qualcomm’s chips.Mark June 10 on your calendar.Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter.

                        'Malaysia Targets Ambitious $107B Investment to Boost Semiconductor SectorMalaysia aims to attract at least 500 billion ringgit ($107 billion) in investments for its semiconductor sector, Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim has reportedly said.The planned investments are targeted at integrated circuit design, advanced packaging, and semiconductor chip manufacturing equipment, reported Reuters.Malaysia plays an important role in the semiconductor market, contributing to 13% of global testing and packaging. Major firms, including Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC) and Infineon Technologies AG (OTC:IFNNY), have made substantial investments in the country in recent years.Prime Minister Anwar also highlighted the goal of establishing at least ten local companies specializing in chip design and packaging, with projected revenues between $210 million and $1 billion.The Malaysian government will allocate $5.3 billion in fiscal support to achieve the objectives, with further details to be provided in the future.Anwar emphasized Malaysia’s capability to advance in the value chain, enhancing high-end manufacturing and semiconductor design.Also Read: US Commerce Department Grants $75M To Absolics For Semiconductor Facility In GeorgiaOn April 22, Anwar announced Malaysia’s plan to build Southeast Asia’s largest integrated circuit design park. The government will offer incentives such as tax breaks, subsidies, and visa exemption fees to attract global tech companies and investors.The initiative aims to move beyond backend chip assembly and testing to high-value, front-end design work.Malaysia is poised to benefit from Chinese chip companies seeking diversification outside of China for their assembly needs.For instance, last September, China’s Xfusion partnered with Malaysia’s NationGate to produce GPU servers, crucial for data centers and AI applications.Additionally, Shanghai-based StarFive is establishing a design center in Penang, while TongFu Microelectronics Co Ltd is expanding its Malaysian facility in collaboration with Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD).Germany’s Infineon announced a €5 billion investment last August to expand its power chip plant in Malaysia.Similarly, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) revealed plans in 2021 to construct a $7 billion advanced chip packaging facility in Malaysia, reinforcing the country’s position in the semiconductor industry.Disclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.Story continuesRead Next: Biden Administration Unveils $285M Funding For Semiconductor InstituteImage Via Shutterstock"ACTIVE INVESTORS\' SECRET WEAPON" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 "news & everything else" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!Get the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?INTEL (INTC): Free Stock Analysis ReportADVANCED MICRO DEVICES (AMD): Free Stock Analysis ReportThis article Malaysia Targets Ambitious $107B Investment to Boost Semiconductor Sector originally appeared on Benzinga.com© 2024 Benzinga.com.

                        'AMD Grabs 33% of Server CPU Market and Prepares for Major Processor Launch: ReportAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) claims it holds a 33% share in the server CPU market as it prepares to launch its next-gen “Turin” processors and unveils a GPU roadmap following the MI300 product line, the Register reports.During the JP Morgan Global Technology, Media, and Communications conference, Jean Hu, AMD’s CFO, highlighted the company’s growth in servers, CPUs, and GPUs. The stock is trading higher on Tuesday.She noted AMD’s partnerships, such as with Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) for virtual machine instances running AMD MI300X GPUs in Azure cloud, and AMD’s success in achieving strong double-digit growth in server CPUs and desktop/laptop segments.Also Read: Supermicro and AMD Roll Out Multi-Node Servers To Enhance Cloud ComputingHu emphasized that AMD’s strategic focus on power efficiency and cost-effectiveness makes it a compelling choice for enterprises facing power and space constraints. Notable clients like American Express Co (NYSE:AXP), Shell Plc (NYSE:SHEL), and STMicroelectronics N.V. (NYSE:STM) are transitioning to AMD-based infrastructure.Hu announced plans for a next-generation AI PC to launch in the second half of the year, which could significantly refresh the PC market. She also mentioned the potential for AMD to re-enter the Arm Holdings Plc (NASDAQ:ARM) market, leveraging its existing capabilities and IP blocks to meet customer demands.AMD sees long-term growth potential in the embedded processor market, mainly through synergies with Xilinx.Hu also highlighted AMD’s robust performance in the desktop and laptop markets.Analysts expect AMD and peers to drive semiconductor industry optimism after their earnings beat as inventory levels normalize and companies ship closer to consumption levels. However, analysts also cautioned against AMD’s MI300 supply constraints, gaming segment weakness and aggressive pricing from Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA).AMD stock gained 33% in the last 12 months. Investors can gain exposure to the stock via Spear Alpha ETF (NASDAQ:SPRX) and Pacer Funds Pacer Data And Digital Revolution ETF (NYSE:TRFK).Price Actions: AMD shares traded higher by 1.87% at $169.47 premarket at the last check on Tuesday.Also Read: AMD Unveils Cost-Effective EPYC 4004 Series CPUs For Small Businesses and IT ProvidersDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.Story continuesPhoto courtesy of AMD"ACTIVE INVESTORS\' SECRET WEAPON" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 "news & everything else" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!Get the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES (AMD): Free Stock Analysis ReportThis article AMD Grabs 33% of Server CPU Market and Prepares for Major Processor Launch: Report originally appeared on Benzinga.com© 2024 Benzinga.com.

Its graphic processing units, notably the H100 and next-generation Blackwell line-up, are better suited to handling the heavy workloads of training and operating AI applications.As a result, enterprise and cloud network operators are spending big money on Nvidia’s chips, which work more quickly and use less energy.Jensen Huang, President of NVIDIA, is riding an AI wave.SOPA Images&sol;Getty ImagesAnother Nvidia blockbuster earnings reportThere’s been concern that Nvidia's sales growth could slow as buyers tap the brakes on previous-generation chips ahead of the widespread availability of Blackwell chips.Related: Nvidia stock hinges on 5 key things in its earnings reportNevertheless, Nvidia delivered an impressive quarter. Revenue was again driven by data center sales. Network upgrades resulted in data center revenue of $22.6 billion, up a whopping 427% from one year ago and 23% above the previous quarter. Analysts predicted data center revenue of $21.1 billion.“We are poised for our next wave of growth. The Blackwell platform is in full production and forms the foundation for trillion-parameter-scale generative AI,” said Huang.Elsewhere, it was also a solid quarter. Gaming revenue rose nicely, increasing by 18% year-over-year to $2.6 billion. Automotive sales totaled $329 million, up 11%, and professional visualization sales were $427 million, up 45 percent from last year.Overall, Nvidia’s first-quarter revenue was $26 billion, bettering Wall Street analysts' target of $24.6 billion and up 262% from one year ago.Investors were also concerned about spending to stay ahead of rivals like Advanced Micro Devices. AMD launched its own specially designed chips for AI earlier this year.Despite Nvidia investing heavily to maintain its 80% AI chip market share, profitability remained strong.Adjusted earnings were $6.12 per share in Q1, above analysts’ $5.58 expectations, and up 461% from last year.Nvidia’s guidance doesn’t disappointIt’s tough for companies to continue ramping up forward expectations when optimism is already sky high. Yet, Nvidia was able to boost its outlook despite the high bar.Related: Analysts reboot Qualcomm stock price target on Microsoft dealFor Nvidia’s fiscal second quarter, Huang forecasts revenue of $28 billion, more than a billion dollars higher than analysts anticipated. A year ago, the company's sales in the July quarter totaled $13.5 billion.Story continuesIt didn’t issue specific per-share profit guidance, but it does expect gross margin to be a healthy 75.5%, give or take a half percent. For perspective, the fiscal first quarter gross margin was 78.9%, up from 66.8% in the same period last year.Nvidia delivers surprising newsThe numbers certainly suggest that demand for AI infrastructure isn’t waning. Investors aren’t just applauding the top-and-bottom-line results, though.More AI Stocks:World's biggest hedge fund boosts its stake in Nvidia stockAnalysts update Dell stock price targets on Tesla-server winMicrosoft delivers a blow to NvidiaHuang also announced that Nvidia shares will split 10:1 to “make stock ownership more accessible to employees and investors.” On June 7, every shareholder as of the close on June 6 will receive nine additional shares for every share they own.Huang didn’t stop there.Nvidia also announced that it is increasing its dividend payout by 150% to 10 cents per share from 4 cents previously. On a post-split basis, the dividend will be 1 cent.Related: Single Best Trade: Wall Street veteran picks Palantir stock",

                        "As it stands today, there are only seven companies in the world with market capitalizations in excess of $1 trillion. This exclusive club includes six of the  \"Magnificent Seven\" -- Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta Platforms.Nvidia is the only pure-play semiconductor and data center services business with a trillion-dollar valuation right now. But as Advanced Micro Devices, Intel, Qualcomm, and more vie with it to meet the world's demand for cutting-edge processors, I wouldn't be surprised to see more chip stocks gain entrance into the trillion-dollar club.But I don't expect any of those three will become the next chip stock to reach a market cap of $1 trillion. I predict instead that it will be Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM), currently the ninth most valuable business in the world, worth $806 billion.The hidden gem of the chip industryNvidia and AMD each develop sophisticated chips known as graphics processing units (GPUs). GPUs provide the computing power to myriad generative AI applications including machine learning, training large language models, accelerated computing, and more.While that puts Nvidia and its rivals front and center in the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, investors might be surprised to learn that they -- and many other chip companies -- rely heavily on Taiwan Semiconductor.While Nvidia, AMD, and many others design GPUs and other chips, they actually outsource most of their manufacturing. Taiwan Semiconductor -- the world's most productive third-party chip fabricator -- brings their chips to life. It also boasts Amazon, Broadcom, Intel, Qualcomm, and Sony as major customers.Image Source: Getty ImagesRemember to think long termIn the first quarter, the company's revenue rose 13% year over year to $18.7 billion, a result that came in at the high end of management's guidance range.TSM Revenue (Quarterly) ChartOne thing that you might notice from the chart above is that Taiwan Semiconductor's revenues and operating profits have fluctuated in recent quarters. That's natural. The semiconductor industry is cyclical, and Taiwan Semiconductor is not immune to the business conditions that impact its clients.During the first-quarter earnings call, management pointed to seasonality in the smartphone business in particular as being responsible for some of the fluctuations in revenue and profit margins.Nevertheless, its long-term outlook remains strong.TSM Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year ChartAnalysts' consensus estimate for Taiwan Semiconductor's 2024 revenue is approximately $84 billion -- representing 21% growth year over year.Story continuesIt's clear that demand for GPUs will change in the short term. This is because many companies that have been buying up the most powerful chips are still figuring out exactly how AI will play into their long-term roadmaps. For this reason, while I expect corporations to allocate more capital toward those chips over time, the growth of the market isn't going to be linear.Although fluctuations in demand will impact Taiwan Semiconductor's business, the long-term secular trends fueling AI should continue benefiting the company. The key theme here is that investors will need to remain patient as Taiwan Semiconductor's newest growth story is very much in its early chapters.Is now a good time to buy Taiwan Semiconductor stock?The chart below benchmarks Taiwan Semiconductor against a large set of players operating in various aspects of the semiconductor landscape.TSM PS Ratio ChartTrading at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 11.3, Taiwan Semiconductor stock has a valuation right in the middle of that pack. I find the steep premium Nvidia stock now carries to be fascinating. While the company is surely experiencing record growth thanks to its leading GPUs and data center services, its relationship with Taiwan Semiconductor might be underappreciated.Indeed, considering how many chip designers rely on Taiwan Semiconductor in some form or fashion, it could be argued that the company's role within the chip realm is being discounted.I am bullish on AI in the long run, and see Taiwan Semiconductor continuing to play a critical role in its progression. I think as companies such as Nvidia and AMD continue to innovate and release new products, it will increasingly land on more investors' radar.Given these dynamics, I see Taiwan Semiconductor following Nvidia to a trillion-dollar valuation sooner rather than later.Should you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?Before you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn’t one of them.

                        "Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this chipmaker have returned +3.9%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry, which Advanced Micro falls in, has gained 5.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Advanced Micro is expected to post earnings of $0.67 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2.4%.The consensus earnings estimate of $3.42 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +29.1%. This estimate has changed -0.5% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.18 indicates a change of +51.3% from what Advanced Micro is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +2.3%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Advanced Micro is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Story continuesThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for AMD _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Advanced Micro, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $5.71 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +6.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $25.29 billion and $31.71 billion estimates indicate +11.5% and +25.4% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryAdvanced Micro reported revenues of $5.47 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +2.2%. EPS of $0.62 for the same period compares with $0.60 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.42 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.99%. The EPS surprise was +3.33%.Over the last four quarters, Advanced Micro surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Advanced Micro is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Advanced Micro. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

                        'We recently published a list entitled Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in June. Since Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) ranks 2nd in the list, it deserves a deeper look.Jim Cramer in a latest program talked about the effect of inflation on US consumers and discussed how it’s impacting the Haves and the Have Nots. Cramer said while everyone is feeling the “pinch of inflation,” the Have Nots are feeling a “heck of a lot more” than the Haves.  Cramer said that the difference between these two classes of consumers is very important for investment portfolios. He complained that many retailers don’t even know their consumers and that’s why they have a totally different reading of the current economic situation and its effects on consumers. Cramer criticized those who aren’t careful about the differences between consumers and use “the consumer” as a blanket term.Cramer talked about several retail companies and how they are directly feeling the effects of inflation as consumers cut back on spending. The CNBC host said that Americans are making tough choices because of rising prices but we usually don’t talk about it.Jim Cramer said that many strategists demand several rate cuts because “they want stocks higher.”“I want higher stock prices too but if we get multiple rate cuts and inflation comes roaring back, it’s the Have Nots that will get hurt.”Jay Powell Is Worried About Tens of Millions of People With Almost Nothing in the Bank, Cramer SaysJim Cramer said that while many people won’t be happy to see a strong jobs report (because that decreases the chances of rate cuts), they should keep in mind the tough situation the Federal Reserve is in.“Jay Powell isn’t worried about those of us with big portfolios. He’s worried about the tens of millions of people with almost nothing in the bank.”For this article we watched several latest programs of Jim Cramer aired recently and picked 10 stocks he’s bullish about and recommending investors to buy or hold. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Is Jim Cramer Recommending Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) Stock in June?Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 124A caller recently asked Jim Cramer about a stock that could be a good long-term investment in the chip manufacturing industry as an alternative to Nvidia and wondered whether it’s Intel. Cramer said “that’s AMD” not Intel.Story continuesAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) indeed has chances of becoming a competitor to NVDA in the coming months and years. Citi analyst Christopher Danely recently said Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is using its “annual product cadence” to keep up with Nvidia. Danley has a $176 price target on Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD).Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is also a strong player in the data center space. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) has teased 5th Generation Epyc Gen CPUs (codename Turin) and their Instinct MI-300 series GPU accelerators. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AMD) server chips are built on Zen5 core CPU architecture.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)’s latest results show a spectacular increase in data center revenue, but a lackluster increase in operating income (+26%) threw water on the enthusiasm around the stock. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) bears also say the stock’s P/E ratio of over 240 is amongst the highest in the chips industry. Surprisingly, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AMD) forward P/E ratio is about two times higher than Nvidia’s.Average analyst estimate for Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is $187.2, which presents an upside potential of 17%. Wall Street analysts expect Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)to grow 32.50% this year and 59% next year. For the next five years the growth will then moderate to 32% on a per-annum basis, which is still high. Based on Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AMD) 2025 EPS forecast, the stock is trading at around 28.6X forward P/E ratio, which isn’t high given Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AMD) growth trajectory and catalysts.Meridian Contrarian Fund stated the following regarding Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a global semiconductor chip maker specializing in central processing units (CPUs), which are considered the core component of most computing devices, and graphics processing units (GPUs), which accelerate operations running on CPUs. We invested in 2018 when it was a mid-cap value stock plagued by many years of underperformance due to lagging technology and lost market hi share versus competitors Intel and Nvidia. Our research identified that changes and investments made by current management under CEO Lisa Su had, over several years, finally resulted in compelling technology that positioned AMD as a stronger competitor to Nvidia and that its latest products were superior to Intel’s. We invested on the the belief that AMD’s valuation at that that time did not reflect the potential for its technology leadership to generate significant market share gains and improved profits. This thesis has been playing out for several years. During the quarter, AMD unveiled more details about its upcoming GPU products for the AI market. The stock reacted positively to expectations that AMD’s GPU servers will be a viable alternative to Nvidia. Although we pared back our exposure to AMD into strength as part of our risk-management practice, we maintained a position in the stock. We believe AMD will continue to gain share in large and growing markets and is reasonably valued relative to the potential for significantly higher earnings.”Overall, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) ranks 2nd on Insider Monkey’s list of Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in June. You can visit Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in June to see other stocks in the list. While we acknowledge the potential of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

                        "As the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution continues to gain steam, chipmakers Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) have experienced widely differing fortunes on the stock market in 2024 so far. While one is outperforming the PHLX Semiconductor Sector index nicely, the other one is lagging.More specifically, Qualcomm stock is up 45% so far this year, which is well above the 28% gains for the PHLX Semiconductor Sector index, as investors are taking note of the company's robust position in the AI chip niche. AMD, meanwhile, gained just 9% in 2024 despite starting the year on a positive note, as its business isn't getting as strong a boost from AI as Wall Street analysts were anticipating.Does this mean that Qualcomm is the better AI stock of the two to buy now? Or will AMD's recent product development moves help it land a significantly bigger share of the lucrative AI chip market and turn its fortunes around?The case for AMDThe market for chips used in AI servers is growing rapidly, but AMD came late to the party. Nvidia is running away with this market with an estimated share of 90%. This explains why Nvidia's data center revenue in the first quarter stood at $22.6 billion, up a whopping 427% year over year.AMD generated just $2.3 billion in revenue from data center chips in the quarter, though it is worth noting that this was up 80% from the year-ago period. AMD credited this impressive growth to increased sales of its Instinct line of data center graphics cards, which are targeted at AI workloads.Also, when it released its Q1 numbers in April, AMD increased its 2024 forecast for AI-related data center graphics processing unit (GPU) revenue to $4 billion, up from the earlier estimate of $3.5 billion it issued in January. Three months prior to that, AMD was forecasting its 2024 data center GPU revenue would land at $2 billion. So, the company has doubled its revenue expectations from this market in the space of just six months.However, it looks like investors were expecting even bigger numbers from AMD. That's not surprising, as it's trading at 12 times sales right now, which is higher than the U.S. tech sector's average price-to-sales ratio of 7.6. The chipmaker's revenue forecast of $5.7 billion for the second quarter would amount to a year-over-year increase of just 6%, which isn't good enough to justify its rich valuation.But then, it won't be surprising to see AMD raising its AI revenue guidance further as the year progresses. The company stands to gain from the increasing AI chip manufacturing capacity of its foundry partner. Additionally, AMD is looking to grab a bigger share of the AI chip market by launching new chips.Story continuesThe company recently unveiled its MI325X data center GPU, which it says is 30% more powerful than rival Nvidia's flagship Hopper architecture-based H200 chip. Also, AMD has now decided to launch a new family of AI accelerators every year so that it can become more competitive.At the same time, the growing adoption of AI-enabled personal computers (PCs) is now driving solid growth in another of AMD's key business segments. Its revenue from the client segment, which includes sales of central processing units (CPUs) used in desktops and laptops, increased a solid 85% year over year to $1.4 billion in the first quarter.AMD management points out that it will have a huge range of AI-enabled PCs powered by its processors by the end of the year. This should allow the company to capitalize on a lucrative growth opportunity; AI-enabled PCs are expected to account for 60% of PCs shipped by 2027 as compared to 19% this year, according to market research firm Statista.All this indicates that there is a good chance that AMD's AI-related business will pick up, which is probably the reason why analysts are expecting its top line to jump 28% in 2025 following a forecast gain of 13% in 2024. So, the possibility of AMD's fortunes turning around thanks to AI cannot be ruled out.The case for QualcommQualcomm, too, is sitting on a secular growth opportunity -- in its case, thanks to AI in the smartphone market. Smartphone sales declined last year amid weak demand, but the advent of AI-enabled smartphones is expected to set off a turnaround in this market, with IDC forecasting growth of 4% this year.Counterpoint Research estimates that 100 million AI smartphones could be shipped this year. Even better, generative AI smartphone shipments are expected to see an annualized growth rate of 83% through 2027, when they would hit 522 million units in shipments. The good part is that Qualcomm has already started capitalizing on this space. Its Snapdragon processors are powering on-device AI capabilities in Samsung's flagship Galaxy smartphones.Additionally, Qualcomm's revenue from Chinese smartphone manufacturers increased 40% year over year in the first half of 2024. More importantly, Qualcomm is pushing the envelope in the AI smartphone market by launching more chips that will allow it to expand beyond top-tier smartphones and target the mid-range smartphone market as well. Not surprisingly, Counterpoint Research expects Qualcomm to dominate the market for AI smartphone chips with a market share of more than 80% over the next couple of years.At the same time, Qualcomm has set its sights on the AI PC market. During its May earnings conference call, CFO Akash Palkhiwala said that all the leading PC manufacturers are going to launch \"next-generation AI PCs powered by our Snapdragon X Elite and X Plus platforms\" starting in mid-2024. Microsoft already announced PCs powered by Qualcomm chips. As a result, there is a good chance that Qualcomm's growth is set to accelerate.The company's revenue in the second quarter of its fiscal 2024 (which ended on March 24) was almost flat year over year at $9.4 billion. Analysts, however, are expecting the company to finish its fiscal year with a 7.2% increase in revenue to $38.4 billion. In fiscal 2025, Qualcomm's top line is forecast to jump by just over 10% to $42.3 billion.Those estimates, however, could be revised higher once the adoption of AI-enabled smartphones and PCs starts gaining critical mass, suggesting that Qualcomm could remain a top AI stock in the future.The verdictBoth AMD and Qualcomm are on track to take advantage of lucrative AI niches. But while AMD is struggling to gain market share against its bigger rival in chips for AI servers, Qualcomm is the dominant player in the smartphone chip market.Also, AMD's steep sales multiple of 12 and trailing earnings multiple of 230 make the stock an expensive investment right now with respect to the growth that it has been delivering. Its forward earnings multiple of 49 is also quite rich.Qualcomm, on the other hand, trades at just 6.4 times sales. It has a trailing earnings multiple of 27, and its forward earnings multiple of 18 points toward the expectation of a nice jump in its bottom line. So investors looking to add an AI stock to their portfolios may be tempted to buy Qualcomm over AMD, given that it is way cheaper and enjoys a dominant position in the fast-growing AI smartphone space.Should you invest $1,000 in Qualcomm right now?Before you buy stock in Qualcomm, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Qualcomm wasn’t one of them.

far this year  which is well above the 28  gains for the phlx semiconductor sector index  as investors are taking note of the company s robust position in the ai chip niche  amd  meanwhile  gained just 9  in 2024 despite starting the year on a positive note  as its business isn t getting as strong a boost from ai as wall street analysts were anticipating does this mean that qualcomm is the

for amdthe market for chips used in ai servers is growing rapidly  but amd came late to the party  nvidia is running away with this market with an estimated share of 90   this explains why nvidia s

                        "Investing.com-- The S&P 500 closed lower Thursday, as rising Treasury yields on signs of sticky inflation dented rate-cut hopes offsetting an Nvidia-led charge higher in tech stocks.At 16:00 ET (20:00 GMT), Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 605 points, or 1.5%, while S&P 500 fell 0.7%, and the tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite fell 0.4%.Fresh signs of pick up in inflation cools rate cut betsThe S&P Global Flash US PMI Composite Output Index rose sharply from 51.3 in April to 54.4 in May, with the report also highlighting that \"the rate of inflation accelerating to register the second-largest monthly increase seen over the past eight months.\"Fresh fears that a underlying strength in the economy could spark a revival inflation, cooled investor expectations for rate cuts just a day after the Fed's May meeting minutes showed members were concerned about stalling disinflation.Adding to fears about demand-led inflation, initial jobless claims fell more than expected in the week ended May 11.Treasury yields jumped, with the yield on the rate-sensitive 2-year treasury rising 5.7 basis points to 4.94%, forcing traders to rein in their bullish bets on stocks.About 48% of traders expect a rate cut in September down from 51% a day earlier.Atlanta Fed president Raphael Bostic said Thursday, however, that the last couple of inflation prints suggest inflation remains on track to return to the 2% target, albeit at a slow pace.Nvidia's surge on positive Q1 boosts tech sector Tech shrugged off the broader market malaise as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) jumped 9% to a record high after the chipmaker's first quarter earnings blew past estimates. The firm also offered up a stronger-than-expected revenue forecast for the current quarter, and announced a 10-for-one forward stock split.Some on Wall Street were keen to point out the Nvidia's customer base is broadening out beyond cloud service providers, likely diluting \"the reliance on big US CSPs,\" UBS said.Live Nation sinks on report of DOJ lawsuit There was more corporate news to digest, outside of Nvidia's earnings, with Live Nation Entertainment (NYSE:LYV) stock sinking 8% on a report that the Department of Justice was planning a lawsuit against the firm over allegedly monopolistic practices by its Ticketmaster unit, and that lawmakers were also seeking a separation of Ticketmaster from the firm.News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA) was flat after the news giant signed a content sharing deal with OpenAI, granting the latter access to content from several of its biggest publications.Story continuesBoeing in China woes, warns on cash flow; ELF Beauty shines on earnings stageBoeing Co (NYSE:BA) fell more than 7% after the aircraft maker warned investors that it cash flow could take a bigger hit than the $3.9B seen in Q1, making it unlikely that it would be able to turn a positive cash flow for the year.In Q1, the company said the is expected to the end the year with positive cash flow, but a series of production issues and the departure of its chief executive officer has weighed on performance.The company also said China had halted deliveries as the country's aviation regulator seeks additional certification documents.ELF Beauty Inc (NYSE:ELF), meanwhile, climbed 18% after the cosmetics maker reported fiscal fourth-quarter results that beat Wall Street estimates.(Peter Nurse, Ambar Warrick contributed to this article.)Related ArticlesAfter-hours movers: Ross Stores, Workday, Intuit, and DeckersMicrosoftâs UAE deal could transfer key U.S. chips and AI technology abroad",
