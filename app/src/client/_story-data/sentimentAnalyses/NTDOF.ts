                        'The Japanese stock market is worth watching for U.S. investors who seek well-run businesses, established brands and very reasonable valuations. Indeed, after the year-to-date run in American stocks, especially those in the tech sector, it makes sense to have a gander at what’s on display in the Japanese stock market, as it looks to add to a recent breakout that’s been decades in the making.Perhaps the number-one reason to check out Japanese stocks is that Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) has made sizeable investments in select Japanese trading companies in recent years. Such investments may not grow, but they do shed light on a market that I believe many U.S. investors should consider inching into, whether it be the reasonable valuations or the international diversification.Let’s look at three Japanese stocks I find most interesting, as U.S. stocks close off May with caution and a slight pullback.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFast Retailing (FRCOY)Entrance to Uniqlo store in the shopping mall in Thailand. Uniqlo is a successful global Japanese fast fashion retail brand.Source: De Monstera Studio . Shutterstock.comFast Retailing (OTCMKTS:FRCOY) is a Japanese clothing retailing firm that’s the parent of UNIQLO. The clothing retailer isn’t just a hit in Japan, it’s also gained in popularity in international markets. As Fast looks to expand UNIQLO’s presence across more global markets, it may very well disrupt the fast fashion industry as we know it.Not only are UNIQLO’s unique (and very Japanese) fashions a hit with select international crowds, but they’re not typical “fast fashions” you’d come to expect. UNIQLO wears may be affordable, but many selections are actually quite timeless and not subject to traditional fashion fads. Amid inflation, UNIQLO has been a great place to shop to get bang for one’s limited buck.Fast has been able to drive some impressive same-store sales growth (SSSG) even in today’s challenged environment. As the retailer continues to execute its sound growth plans, perhaps FRCOY stock could be positioned for a fast turnaround after its latest 19% correction off 52-week highs.Nintendo (NTDOY)Source: NintendoNintendo (OTCMKTS:NTDOY) is a Japanese video gaming company that we’re all familiar with. It’s not only the company behind the Nintendo Switch console and the wide selection of exclusive titles; it’s also behind legendary brands such as Pokemon. Undoubtedly, video games just wouldn’t be the same without Nintendo.With a new console (Switch 2.0?) release up ahead, I do view NTDOY stock as worth consideration before the device has a chance to “level up” the stock. I not only think the next iteration of the Switch will be a hit, but I also view the launch as opportunistic, as its video-game console rivals look to push forward only incremental upgrades to the existing console generation (think Pro editions or handhelds).Story continuesCompared to rivals, Nintendo looks competitive ahead of its new Switch launch. Perhaps it’s time to switch to the stock while it’s going for just 19.8 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E), ahead of Nintendo’s much-awaited console catalyst.Toyota Motor (TM)Toyota motor corporation logo on dealership buildingSource: josefkubes / Shutterstock.comFinally, we have the Japanese automaker Toyota Motor (NYSE:TM), which has one of the best reputations in the industry. Undoubtedly, Toyota is the epitome of Japanese engineering. As the company steers forward into the hybrid and fully electric vehicle (EV) age, I like the stock and its modest multiple.At writing, TM stock goes for 9.2 times trailing P/E, making it one of the deepest value plays on the Japanese market. As an added bonus, U.S. investors don’t need to go “over the counter” for shares, as they trade on the NYSE.With TM stock recently plunging 16% after its parabolic melt-up that started back in early 2023, I think there’s a great window to buy. While Toyota isn’t the top EV stock to own right now, its slow and steady electrification plans may ultimately be the model that helps it shift gears without stumbling considerably.If you think hybrid autos are the nearer-term future while fully electric is more of a long-term target, TM stock looks to be the stock to own.On the date of publication, Joey Frenette held shares of Berkshire Hathaway (Class B).

                        "(Bloomberg) -- Nintendo Co. has acquired Miami-based Shiver Entertainment to help bring more games from outside developers to its next-generation Switch platform.Most Read from BloombergSingapore Air Changes Seatbelt Rules After Fatal TurbulenceSpaceX Weighs Plan to Sell Shares at $200 Billion ValuationThe Rise and Fall of Simon Sadler's Segantii, One of Asia's Most Successful Hedge FundsChina’s $538 Billion Deposit Exodus Supercharges Rally in BondsNvidia Stock Surges as Sales Forecast Delivers on AI HopesThe 11-year-old studio focuses on adapting video games developed for one platform to others, called porting, and did so successfully with Hogwarts Legacy and Mortal Kombat 1 for the current Switch console. Nintendo “aims to secure high-level resources for porting and developing software titles,” the Kyoto-based company said in a statement Tuesday.The move signals greater interest from Nintendo to bring in content to bolster the offerings from its in-house creative studios, after decades of relying mostly on its own software to drive console sales. The company signed a 10-year pact with Microsoft Corp. last year to ensure the Call of Duty series will be on Switch platforms for the foreseeable future. The Shiver deal may also be a measure to address existing and future performance gaps with rival consoles.“Nintendo’s next-generation machine is expected to be less powerful than the PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X, thus the purchase now is to expand the company’s support for outside developers when making high-end games for the new platform,” Toyo Securities analyst Hideki Yasuda said. “Shiver Entertainment did a beautiful job in porting Hogwarts Legacy to Switch.”A successor to the Nintendo Switch will be fully announced by March, the company said at its most recent earnings report, with the next-generation device not expected to go on sale until next year.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe Dodgers Mogul and the Indian Infrastructure Giant That Wasn’tTikTok Video Playing on Finance Bro Stereotype Becomes a Viral HitThe Six Choke Points That Can Upend Global TradeA Hidden Variable in the Presidential Race: Fears of ‘Trump Forever’Google’s Moonshot Factory Falls Back Down to Earth©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

                        'The markets are moving higher after a cooler reading on inflation stirs hopes that interest rates will be cut at some point in 2024. However, with many stocks still looking significantly overvalued, investors are on the hunt for undervalued cheap stocks.A cheap stock can be measured by fundamentals like its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. However, in many cases, a stock’s price is the barometer of cheap or expensive. In this article, we’re looking at stocks trading for $20 or less.At this price, investors get the benefit of accumulating a significant amount of shares for a modest investment. Another advantage of finding undervalued cheap stocks under $20 is that a little price movement can have significant benefits for your portfolio. Here are seven stocks that look undervalued but have catalysts for future growth.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsClean Energy Fuels (CLNE)CLNE stock: Image of a Metro Local public transportation bus on Hollywood Blvd.Source: ZikG / Shutterstock.comClean Energy Fuels (NASDAQ:CLNE) stock is down 42% in the last 12 months, and it’s not hard to understand why. The company’s primary business comes from renewable natural gas that the company provides for heavy-duty trucks, buses and other large vehicles in North America.But natural gas prices have been kept in check, along with the price of oil. That could be changing, however, as surging demand for natural gas seems inevitable.Many analysts predict the demand for data centers to support artificial intelligence (AI) applications will require amounts of energy that current renewable energy resources will be insufficient to meet. Natural gas may be able to fill that need.And while Clean Energy Fuels isn’t directly involved in providing natural gas for data centers it’s a case of a commodity being the rising tide that lifts all boats. In this case, the increased demand for natural gas will lift the entire sector.Clean Energy Fuels is currently a penny stock trading at just $2.62 per share. But analysts don’t believe it will be a penny stock for long. The consensus price target of eight analysts for CLNE stock is $7.00, 167% higher than its current price, and is listed as a Strong Buy.Kinder Morgan (KMI)Kinder Morgan logo on a sign outside the company headquarters in Houston.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comThe theme of rising demand for natural gas will also be a catalyst for Kinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI). This is a midstream company that owns an expansive network of oil and natural gas pipelines in the United States and Canada.And there’s another reason to believe that natural gas prices may be moving higher. As Josh Enomoto wrote, you can feel the geopolitical screws tightening as it relates to oil. Russia’s war against Ukraine and rising tensions in the Middle East give investors a reason to consider energy stocks that will be a critical link in the supply chain.Story continuesKMI stock is up 14% in the last three months. However, over the last three years, the stock has been range-bound. That’s what makes this a critical moment for one of the undervalued cheap stocks. At around $19.60 per share, the stock is butting up against what has been a level of resistance. If the stock breaks out, analysts may start to raise their price targets above the consensus target of $20.31.DigitalBridge Group (DBRG)An image of a person typing at a kayboard with data overlaid, hand pointing toward dataSource: everything possible/ShutterstockDigitalBridge Group (NYSE:DBRG) gives you another way to invest in the increased demand for data centers. Specifically, DigitalBridge is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that invests heavily in data centers. The company manages $75 billion in digital infrastructure assets.The bullish case for DigitalBridge will depend on profitability. That will likely come in time as the company (i.e., the asset manager) earns a fee on every dollar of equity it manages.That said, the company is already posting revenue and earnings growing year-over-year. That adds credibility to the analysts’ projections for 38% earnings growth in the next 12 months. If that’s the case, DBRG stock may shoot past its 52-week high as the analysts suggest it will.AT&T (T)Image of a person holding their smartphoneSource: ShutterstockIt could be said that AT&T (NYSE:T) isn’t your father’s AT&T. But few people would imagine that T stock is closer to your grandfather’s AT&T. But that’s the case, as the company has simplified its business model. It went far afield from its core phone business. And as the world went digital, AT&T got leapfrogged.The final indignity for shareholders was when the company halved its dividend after spinning off its TimeWarner business. But with T stock down about 35% in the last 10 years, it may be time to give the company a closer look.Streamlining the business has allowed the company to slowly but surely lower its debt. In fact, in the company’s first quarter 2024 earnings report, AT&T had the lowest amount of debt on its balance sheet while increasing its free cash flow to $3.1 billion, $2.1 billion more than in Q1 2023.That brings us back to the dividend, which still carries a yield of 6.42%. The company hasn’t raised it in over a year, but it’s one way the company could reward shareholders.Nintendo (NTDOY)Source: NintendoBy traditional metrics, such as the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, Nintendo (OTCMKTS:NTDOY) doesn’t immediately come across as undervalued. Its P/E ratio of 20.4x is in line with the broader market average.However, what sets the company up as one of the undervalued cheap stocks comes down to a company that knows what it does well. In this case, Nintendo generates 90% of its revenue via its popular Nintendo Switch device.The company is preparing to launch the next generation of the Nintendo Switch before March 2025. It’s been nine years since the Switch has had a refresh. That should create strong pent-up demand for the device for its loyal customer base.That expectation is likely a key reason why the consensus price target of 25 analysts is $57.45. That’s a whopping 319.9% gain from the NTDOY stock price on May 16, 2024.Barrick Gold (GOLD)An image of a rising bar graph on top of gold bars, representing gold stocksSource: Alexander Limbach / ShutterstockInvesting in commodities is challenging. Investing in mining stocks tied to the underlying commodities is even more difficult. That’s been the case with Barrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD), one of the world’s leading gold mining companies.The company has one of the largest portfolios of Tier One gold and copper assets in the mining industry. In its Q1 2024 earnings report, Barrick reported gold production of 940 thousand ounces. That was lighter than the prior quarter due to what the company termed “planned maintenance.”If you look at the spot chart of gold and the GOLD stock chart, you’ll notice both were trading in a range over the last two years. Gold appears to be breaking out of that range and is soaring to what some experts believe will be $2,600 an ounce. But mining stocks are only beginning to move higher.The latest readings on inflation don’t change the long-term narrative for owning gold or gold stocks. Many investors can see the U.S. dollar continues to drop in value. That’s where gold shines. It’s also why investment banks can’t buy enough of it right now.Prosus (PROSY)The simplest way to describe Prosus (OTCMKTS:PROSY) is a company that invests in technology. The company operates internet platforms in food delivery, classifieds, payments & fintech, EdTech and retail businesses.As was the case in 2023, Tencent Holdings (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) is the largest holding of Prosus, which owns 25% of the Chinese company. As Will Ashworth wrote in 2023, Prosus has a lot of moving parts that make it difficult to evaluate.Nevertheless, the argument for PROSY stock to be included as one of the undervalued cheap stocks comes from the company’s latest investor presentation in which Prosus shows strong growth through each of its businesses. And the company is now accelerating its forecast for profitability into the second half of this calendar year.If that happens, the consensus price target of $9.04, a 13.8% gain, will likely move higher.On the date of publication, Chris Markoch did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

                        'The global gaming market has grown significantly, driven by technological advancements, increased accessibility and the rise of trends like the metaverse and e-sports. Industry reports estimate the market will grow from $272.86 billion in 2024 to $426.02 billion by 2029, with a compound annual growth rate, otherwise known as CAGR, of 9.32%.Meanwhile, the performance of gaming stocks mostly hinges on the ability to innovate, retain users and capitalize on emerging trends. As with all long-term investments, potential investors should keep a close eye on a given gaming company’s financials, user metrics, as well as strategic moves. With that information, here are three gaming stocks to buy in the second quarter.Nintendo (NTDOY)gaming stocks, Close up photo of arcade game buttons and toggle in arcadeSource: shutterstock.com/iChzigoAmong the gaming stocks to buy, Japan-based Nintendo (OTCMKTS:NTDOY) stands out for its long-standing history and enduring popularity. Founded in 1889, Nintendo has evolved from a playing card company to a global leader in video game platforms and mobile applications, known for its innovative consoles and iconic characters. Many readers are likely to be familiar with its franchises such as Super Mario, Zelda and Pokémon.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNintendo operates primarily through its flagship product, the Nintendo Switch platform, which accounts for more than 90% of revenues. The gaming company also has revenue from mobile, intellectual property and traditional playing cards.Yet, despite a diverse product range, the Nintendo Switch remains the cornerstone of Nintendo’s revenue generation.Recent financials for the full fiscal year ending March 2024 showed revenues of 1.67 trillion Japanese yen. This meant a 4.4% increase year-over-year, with ordinary income climbing 13.2% to 680.5 billion JPY. Over three-quarters of the sales came outside of Japan. With a net profit margin of over 29%, the company boasts impressive profitability margins.Meanwhile, management forecasts revenue to decrease to 1,350 billion JPY during fiscal year 2025. Nonetheless, the company plans to unveil the successor to the Nintendo Switch before March 2025. This milestone will arrive more than nine years after the initial launch of the Switch in March 2015.So far in the year, NTDOY stock has advanced over 13.43% the past month. Shares are changing hands at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 20.55x earnings and a price-to-sales ratio of 5.84x. These metrics potentially reflect investor confidence in Nintendo’s ability to maintain its market strength, especially with the upcoming console update.Story continuesRoblox (RBLX)A smartphone displaying a web page for Roblox Corp (RBLX).Source: Koshiro K / Shutterstock.comIf you are looking for a gaming company with a niche in combining creativity with online collaboration, then Roblox (NYSE:RBLX) deserves your attention among the lists of gaming stocks to buy. Over the platform, users create and explore 3D digital worlds. Online gamers point out that Roblox’s approach has democratized game development while enriching the platform’s offerings.Currently, Roblox boasts a market capitalization of approximately $21 billion. According to recent earnings results, revenue for the quarter was $801.3 million, up 22% YOY.In terms of bookings, which represent the sales of virtual goods on the platform, there was also a notable increase by 19% to reach $923.8 million. The gaming company generates revenue primarily through its virtual currency, Robux.One of the most widely watched indicators of Roblox’s results is its user engagement metrics. The platform’s daily active users reached 77.7 million by the end of March, up 17.55% from the previous quarter. In other words, the platform has growing appeal among users.Moreover, the total hours engaged on the platform surged to 16.7 billion in the first quarter of the year, up by over 15% from the previous quarter.Despite the strong growth of the platform, the gaming stock has lost approximately 22% year-to-date. Yet the P/S ratio of 6.99x highlights that Roblox shares still command a premium valuation.As the metaverse trend gains traction worldwide, Roblox’s position as a user-generated content platform is likely to become even more prominent. Readers watching developments in the broader metaverse space may regard declines below the $40 level as a better entry point into RBLX stock.Tencent (TCEHY)Tencent (TCEHY) sign on Tencent headquarters in Shenzhen, China.Source: StreetVJ / Shutterstock.comFounded in 1998 and headquartered in Shenzhen, the conglomerate Tencent (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) has evolved from a regional tech company into a global powerhouse. The company has been involved in various sectors including gaming, social media and fintech. Thus, for investors eyeing the gaming stocks to buy, TCEHY may offer a viable opportunity.Tencent’s financial health is robust. On May 14, management of the Chinese group released financial results for the first quarter of 2024. Total revenue of $22.5 billion was up 6% over the first quarter of 2023. Meanwhile, operating margin went up to 37% from 30% a year ago.Analysts highlight that Tencent has been showing promising growth, particularly in its gaming sector. The company reported a 26% year-over-year growth in advertising revenue, driven by enhanced engagement and artificial intelligence-powered ad targeting.Meanwhile, the fintech and business services segment is also growing, bolstered by wealth management services and increased technology service fees.Since January, TCEHY has advanced 36%. Meanwhile, the shares are trading at a valuation of about 31.06 times forward earnings. In recent weeks, many Chinese stock market heavyweights, including Tencent, have been buying back their shares. If this trend continues, the future might be even brighter for TCEHY stock investors.On the date of publication, Tezcan Gecgil did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Tezcan Gecgil, PhD, began contributing to InvestorPlace in 2018.

                        "Nintendo is bringing more diversity to its board of directors.The video game giant, in its most-recent earnings report, announced plans to appoint three women to the board. Miyoko Demay, Eiko Osawa and Keiko Akashi were named as anticipated new directors, with a planned start date of June 27.If approved, they will join Asa Shinkawa, who became the first woman to join Nintendo’s board in 2020. Prior to that, no women had been a part of the company’s senior management since its founding in 1889.Demay is a long-time senior executive at Tiffany & Co.’s Japan offices, having served as president and senior executive of luxury strategy and operations.Osawa has worked for a number of firms—including Asahi and Ernst & Young—and served as a tax accountant. She’s currently an outside auditor for EXEO Group. Akashi, who is also an auditor, worked for the Osaka Regional Taxation Bureau for many years. Osawa and Akashi will join as members of Nintendo’s audit and supervisory committee.The company, in 2021, announced the formation of a “Nintendo Women and Allies” initiative to promote women's careers there, describing it as “Supporting and promoting diversity, equity and inclusion for women through leadership, networking and professional development opportunities.”However, in its 2023 annual report, it acknowledged the company was still something of a boy’s club, with women filling just 4.2% of its manager roles. In addition, the report found women at Nintendo made about 72% of what men earned. The company said that was because of differences in the length of time people had worked for the company.This story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

                        '(Bloomberg) -- Shares of Nintendo Co. tumbled their most in over a month after the company warned of a sharp profit fall and signaled a next-generation Switch wouldn’t arrive till 2025.Most Read from BloombergElon Musk Pledges to Grow Supercharger Business He Just DecimatedBiden Set to Hit China EVs, Strategic Sectors With TariffsAckman Scolded Over DEI Views at Closed-Door Milken SessionJim Simons, Code Breaker Who Mastered Investing, Dies at 86Apple Apologizes for iPad Pro Ad, Scraps Plan to Air It on TVThe stock fell as much as 4.9% in Tokyo after President Shuntaro Furukawa posted on X to say that while Nintendo plans to announce a successor to the seven-year-old Switch in the coming year, that won’t happen during an annual Nintendo Direct event in June. The post came shortly after Nintendo said it expects operating income to fall a bigger-than-expected 24% to ¥400 billion ($2.6 billion) on a 19% revenue decline in the year to March 2025.The profit warning and uncertainty surrounding a new gaming console underscore the challenge for the company that’s still reliant on aging hardware.Furukawa’s post would mean the launch of the next-generation hardware will occur in 2025 at the earliest, SMBC Securities analyst Eiji Maeda said. “That means Nintendo’s target to sell 13.5 million units of the Switch this fiscal year “looks challenging ahead of the release of a next-gen console,” he said.Fans and investors have long awaited word on a succession plan for the 2017 gadget, which has ratcheted up more than 141 million sales over its lifetime. Nintendo has resisted discussing any plans and kept the original console going with marquee game releases. But it lost significant ground to a resurgent Sony Group Corp. with its PlayStation 5 over the past year, and will contest the key holiday season against newer and more powerful machines, including in Microsoft Corp.’s Xbox range.For the March quarter, the company reported a bigger-than-expected 31% decline in operating profit to ¥64.5 billion. That was despite the boost from a weak yen that lifted operating income at the Kyoto-based firm by ¥35 billion for the full year.The company now expects Switch sales of 13.5 million units in the current fiscal year, down from 15.7 million. Its guidance on software sales also points to a decline, from 200 million units to 165 million units.“Now that this announcement is out in the world, I think Nintendo has no choice but to cut prices or offer attractive hardware and software bundles to get to the 13.5 million Switch units they want to sell this year,” said industry analyst Serkan Toto. “They will get through the Switch’s final year somehow, but I would not expect too many blockbusters until the new hardware arrives.”Story continuesNintendo told suppliers and software partners earlier this year that it was delaying the launch of the next-generation console until March 2025 or later, scrapping an initial plan to release it by this year’s end, Bloomberg News reported. The creator of the Super Mario Bros. games is also likely to hold back major releases of its most popular franchises to help boost initial sales of the next machine.The Switch’s versatility and family-friendly ethos, developed under the oversight of creator and former Nintendo President Satoru Iwata, have made it one of the company’s most successful pieces of hardware. But the firm’s history offers a cautionary tale: A decade earlier, the Wii U failed to carry on the success of the Wii, another of Nintendo’s biggest hits.Nintendo has been pushing its Nintendo Switch Online subscription service to entice new customers to buy the device and cultivate a broad user base for the next console. The 134-year-old company is also turning to its nascent motion picture business for new revenue.After the blockbuster success of The Super Mario Bros. Movie last year, Nintendo is developing a live-action film based on The Legend of Zelda, to be co-produced by game creator Shigeru Miyamoto and Marvel Studios founder Avi Arad and distributed by Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc. The release date is yet to be announced.--With assistance from Vlad Savov.(Updates with share reaction and analyst commentary)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekHow Uniqlo’s ‘Millennial Birkin’ Is Beating Designer BagsTim Cook Can’t Run Apple Forever.

                        'Video games continue to be one of the most popular forms of entertainment in the world. Nearly 50 years after the first video game consoles debuted, the industry is stronger and more diverse than ever. According to Midia Research, the video games industry will reach global annual revenues of more than $300 billion and a worldwide audience of 3.8 billion active players by 2030.Consumers today are spending more on video games than they are on going to the movies, streaming TV shows, and many other forms of entertainment. For companies operating in the sector, gaming continues to be very lucrative, especially as the industry migrates online and away from brick-and-mortar retail outlets such as GameStop (NYSE:GME).With the industry showing no signs of slowing down, we look at three video game stocks better equipped to beat the market slump than GameStop.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMicrosoft (MSFT)The Microsoft logo outside a building representing MSFT stock.Source: Asif Islam / Shutterstock.comMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is such a diversified company that people forget it’s one of the biggest video game companies in the world. And Microsoft’s position within the video game sector has gotten larger and more influential following its successful $68 billion acquisition of video game publisher Activision Blizzard, which it completed last autumn. Today, Microsoft not only makes the Xbox console but also publishes popular video game such as “Call of Duty,” “World of Warcraft” and “Candy Crush.”In its first-quarter financial results, Microsoft noted that revenue from the Xbox rose 62% year over year. This comes as it successfully integrates Activision Blizzard and benefits from sales of its games. Going forward, Microsoft says it is adding artificial intelligence (AI) to its video games to deepen the experience for users and make them more immersive. With MSFT stock, investors also get a leading AI, cloud computing and software company.Microsoft stock is up 26% over the last 12 months.Nintendo (NTDOY)A yellow Switch Lite from Nintendo (NTDOY) sits in front of a bright pink background.Source: ESOlex / Shutterstock.comJapanese video game company Nintendo (OTC:NTDOY) is one of the biggest and best-known video game companies in the world.

Nintendo has told game publishers that the next version of its flagship console will be delayed until 2025. The company initially planned to release a new version of the Switch this autumn in time for year-end holiday shopping.Story continuesThe first-generation Switch console is now seven years old and analysts say a new version is needed. Despite its age, the Switch continues to be a worldwide bestseller with Nintendo forecasting 2024 sales of 15.5 million units.

In business since the dawn of the video game industry back in 1975, Turtle Beach today is primarily known for making headsets that gamers wear.

                        "TOKYO (AP) — Japanese video-game maker Nintendo said Tuesday that it will make an announcement about a successor to its Switch home console sometime before March 2025.In reporting its financial results, Nintendo gave no details about the announcement, including about whether it would launch that successor product during this fiscal year, or just announce its plans for it.“We will make an announcement about the successor to Nintendo Switch within this fiscal year. It will have been over nine years since we announced the existence of Nintendo Switch back in March 2015,” the company's president, Shuntaro Furukawa, said in a statement.Kyoto-based Nintendo Co. reported a 13% rise in profit for the fiscal year that ended in March, boosted by solid demand for Switch software like “The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.”Nintendo’s net profit for the fiscal year through March 2024 totaled 490.6 billion yen ($3 billion), up from 432.7 billion yen in the previous fiscal year. Annual sales rose 4% to 1.67 trillion yen ($11 billion), nearly 80% of it from outside Japan.Besides “The Legend of Zelda,” whose global sales for the fiscal year totaled 20.6 million units, “Super Mario Bros. Wonder” sold 13.4 million units, and “Pikmin 4” sold nearly 3.5 million, according to Nintendo.The release a year ago of the film, “The Super Mario Bros. Movie,” also helped sales.The yen's weakness against the dollar, which lifts the value in yen of overseas earnings of Japanese exporters like Nintendo, also helped. The U.S. dollar has averaged about 151 Japanese yen over the past fiscal year, up from 133 yen in the previous fiscal year.Nintendo, which did not break down quarterly numbers, was less optimistic about its financial results for the fiscal year through March 2025, forecasting net profit to fall to 300 billion yen ($1.9 billion).Nintendo has sold more than 141 million Switch machines, 15.7 million of them during the fiscal year that just ended.Such sales tend to gradually decline over the years, so offering a steady stream of fun games is crucial.“Endless Ocean Luminous,” which went on sale this month, has the player go on a virtual scuba diving adventure, complete with whales, colorful fish and other sea creatures. “Luigi’s Mansion 2,” featuring the plumber Mario’s brother, goes on sale next month.Nintendo is also planning a new film for worldwide release in April 2026. It’s counting on the openings of Donkey Kong Country in Universal Studios Japan, as well as a museum on Nintendo in Kyoto, both scheduled for later this year, to woo more fans to its franchise.Story continues___Yuri Kageyama is on X: https://twitter.com/yurikageyama",

The company expects to sell 13.5 million Switch units in the current financial year, according to Reuters, compared to sales of 15.7 million units last year.Nintendo has a long and storied track record of reinventing the wheel for both consoles and games, and the Switch has been one of its most successful products to date. When it first launched in 2017, it took the world by storm primarily for its portability.At a time when major rivals like Playstation and Xbox were developing stationary consoles with increasingly impressive graphics and processing power, Nintendo opted for another route.The handheld Switch could be used both as a console for a television at home, and also be thrown into a bag and played on the move.While its graphic performance was much lower than its Sony (SONY) and Microsoft (MSFT) rivals, consumers didn’t mind thanks to the plethora of entertaining and often family friendly games in Nintendo’s stable.Over the last seven years, little has changed in terms of the Switch’s development with three distinct models currently available for prospective owners.There’s the Nintendo Switch OLED and its rich, immersive screen; the standard Nintendo Switch with its tried-and-true hybrid design; and the cheaper and smaller Nintendo Switch Lite for those who mainly play on the go.For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com',

                        'By Sam NusseyTOKYO (Reuters) -Japan\'s Nintendo said on Tuesday it plans to make an announcement about the successor to its long-lasting Switch console during the financial year ending March 2025.Nintendo has extended the lifecycle of the Switch device with hit titles such as "The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom", with the market focused on the prospects for a smooth transition to next-generation hardware.The Kyoto-based gaming company said it expects to sell 13.5 million Switch units in the current financial year as it tries to squeeze further sales from the aging device.Nintendo did not offer further details on new hardware, saying that there would be no disclosure at its Nintendo Direct presentation in June."A lot of users will now hold off buying the current Switch as they know that the new model will come out some time in 2025," said Serkan Toto, founder of the Kantan Games consultancy.Nintendo last year sold 15.7 million units of the hybrid home-portable device, which launched in March 2017. Nintendo lifted its full-year forecast to 15.5 million units in February.The company has made incremental changes to its Switch devices, with sales of the OLED model growing year-on-year even as broader hardware sales continued their annual decline.Nintendo expects operating profit to fall this year by around a quarter to 400 billion yen ($2.6 billion).The company is seen as having a thin pipeline as it holds back heavy-hitting titles for the successor device with announced titles including "Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door" later this month and "Luigi\'s Mansion 2" in June.Nintendo expects to sell 165 million software units this year, which would be a 17% decline on the year earlier."The development of games has become more sophisticated, long term and complex," Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa said when asked how the market has changed since the Switch launched.In the year ended March operating profit grew 4.9% to 528.9 billion yen.Nintendo\'s shares closed up 2.4% ahead of earnings and are up 5.4% this year after a recent sell-off."Fiscal 2026 is a very late launch window for new hardware," said Toto.($1 = 154.2700 yen)(Reporting by Sam Nussey; Editing by Christopher Cushing, Tom Hogue and Louise Heavens)',

In the UK, investors eagerly await the Bank of England’s latest decision on interest rates.Thus far, 78% of S&P 500 (^GSPC) companies have reported their earnings, with 77% delivering an earnings beat.In the Middle East, the world’s most profitable company Saudi Aramco will show if oil is still king.Here's what to look out for:BP (BP.L) – Reports on Tuesday 7 MayAnalysts expect BP's profits to slow due to a lower oil price, weaker refining margins and concerns over its energy transition strategy.The refining margin is seen shrinking almost 30% to $20.10 per barrel, consensus shows. The first-quarter $1.75bn buyback tranche expected to be repeated in the second quarter, according to Bloomberg.Revenues for the first quarter are forecast to be around $49,315bn, a significant decrease from around $56,951bn in Q1 2023 with pre-tax profits dropping from $8,535bn in Q1 2023 to $6,371bn in Q1 2024. Earnings per share are estimated to come in at $0.18, down from $0.27 per share last year, according to IG.Investors will look at four headline figures when they assess the first-quarter results, said investment platform AJ Bell.“The first is underlying replacement cost profit. This is not a statutory figure, but it is one that irons out any exceptional items and also the movement in value of the company’s stocks of oil and gas. The consensus analysts’ forecast is $2.9bn, not far below the result in the fourth quarter of 2023 but well down from the $5bn earned in the first three months of last year,” Russ Mould, investment director, Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis, and Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst, all of AJ Bell, wrote.“The second is net debt. BP has done an excellent job of cutting its borrowings since the terrible fright it received during the pandemic when oil and gas prices collapsed. Cost cuts, capex cuts and asset disposals have helped to cut the net debt pile to $18bn from a peak of $51bn in 2020.“The third is capital investment, and also the mix between hydrocarbons and renewables. After spending $15.6bn in 2023, BP has steered the market to expect $16bn in 2024.“Finally, attention will switch to cash returns. In 2023, BP paid out $4.8bn in dividends and $7.9bn in share buybacks. The dividend ended 2023 at 7.27 cents and analysts expect 7.6 cents a quarter on average this year, while the company has already announced $3.5bn of buybacks for the first half of 2024. Add that to the forecast dividend and BP is already expected to return $8.5bn to shareholders this year, or some 8% of its current stock market valuation.Story continuesSaudi Aramco (2222.SR) – Reports on Tuesday 7 MayOPEC+ output cuts are expected to hit Aramco’s profit but investors will be keen to see hear updates on the extent of payouts after the oil major pledged £43bn in performance-linked dividends in 2024.Benchmark oil prices remain favourable, supporting the company’s “strong financial position,” according to Bloomberg Intelligence.The state-owned company is set to distribute $124bn in total dividends this year, a 66% increase since 2021.Aramco has been pushing its expansion in key geographies to attract new investment to the Saudi downstream sector. It has recently signed an agreement with China’s Rongsheng Petrochemical) to expand its liquids-to-chemicals project at Saudi Aramco Jubail Refinery Company (SASREF).It has also entered the Pakistani fuel retail market by acquiring a 40% stake in Gas and Oil Pakistan (GO).The stock currently has a recommendation rating of 2.9 according to Yahoo Finance data, with consensus being ‘hold’. It is currently trading at SAR29.95 (£6.36) but the market puts its target price at SAR33.60 (£7.13)Uber (UBER) – Reports on Wednesday 8 MayThe market expects Uber Technologies to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2024.Uber is expected to post a loss of $0.19 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -143.2%, according to Zachs Equity Research.Revenues are expected to be $10.08bn, up 14.2% from the year-ago quarter.The ride-hailing app was sued by thousands of London’s black-cab drivers this week in a suit seeking hundreds of millions of pounds, accusing it of unlawfully operating in the capital city.Trading at $68.57, analysts have it at a $87.77 price target, with trader consensus being to ‘buy’ or ‘strong buy’ given the discount.Bank of England’s interest rate decision – Thursday 9 MayObviously not a stock but one the biggest market moving decisions in the UK. Threadneedle Street is not expected to cut interest rates this meeting but investors should look for hints from governor Andrew Bailey and the other members of the monetary policy committee (MPC).Currently, interest rates have been frozen at 5.25% and have remained at that level for the past few months.Financial markets put almost zero chance on a rate cut on 9 May, after the next meeting of the MPC. They are fully pricing a first move only in September, but some economists point to June.Deutsche Bank economist Sanjay Raja said: “We expect the MPC to keep the bank rate on hold at 5.25% for a sixth consecutive meeting. But this doesn't mean that the May meeting will be uneventful. We expect the MPC to set the stage for a June rate cut.”HSBC chairman Mark Tucker predicts that the BoE will lower interest rates by 1.5 percentage points by the end of next year. That would lower bank rate to 3.75%, from 5.25% today.\"We expect the ECB and Bank of England to cut rates in June, cutting by 150bps by year-end 2025. We expect the Fed to cut in September, cutting by 100bps by year-end 2025,\" Tucker said.Last month, the Bank of England's chief economist Huw Pill highlighted that the economic outlook has not changed substantially but that cuts to interest rates may be 'somewhat closer' now than they were last month.“Markets have recalibrated their expectations and now expect just two cuts this year, down to 5.00% in August and then 4.75% in December. The UK two-year gilt yield, which has an uncanny record of moving six to nine months before the Bank of England does, stands at 4.51%, to imply just three cuts in the next two years,” AJ Bell said.The OECD has warned the UK that borrowing should remain expensive until the rate of price rises eases further and stays there.\"The fiscal and monetary policy mix is adequately restrictive and should remain so until inflation returns durably to target,\" the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development 's economic outlook for 2024 said.Other companies reporting next week include:Monday 6 MayMicrochip (MCHP)Palantir (PLTR)Simon Property (0L6P.L)BioNTech (22UA.F)Tyson Foods (TSNF34.SA)Loews (LTR.BE)Coty (COTY)JLL (JLL)Goodyear (GT)Coca-Cola Consolidated (COKE)Tuesday 7 MayUBS (UBSG.SW)Unicredit (UCG.MI)Lyft (LYFT)Nintendo (7974.T)Walt Disney (DIS)Wednesday 8 MayFox Corporation (FOXA)NewsCorp (NWSA)BMW (BMW.DE)Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD)Airbnb (ABNB)Toyota (7203.T)Thursday 9 MayNissan (7201.T)Panasonic (6752.T)ITV (ITV.L)Friday 10 MayHonda (7267.T)International Airlines Group (IAG.L)TataMotors (TATAMOTORS.NS)You can read Yahoo Finance's full calendar here.Watch: What April's slowing job growth means for the FedDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

                        "Nintendo Co. Ltd. (TSE:7974) (NTDOY) has worked to re-establish itself in the video game industry over the past several years. The company boasts a valuable portfolio of intellectual property and great expertise. This, combined with a dedicated fanbase cultivated over generations, creates a powerful competitive advantage that translates into consistent growth, robust profitability and strong cash generation.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Signs with AMD.However, despite its strengths, investors must carefully consider Nintendo's current valuation and growth prospects. While the company continues to be a cash cow, its price-earnings ratio might suggest a potentially stretched valuation. Additionally, with the gaming landscape constantly shifting, the question remains: Can the company maintain its edge and deliver the kind of growth that will justify its current price?Nintendo's business modelNintendo relies heavily on its intellectual property as the cornerstone of its business model. These iconic franchises, which include Mario, Zelda and Pokemon, have sustained remarkable success over several decades. Notably, Pokemon stands out as one of the most valuable media franchises in the world. Over the years, Nintendo has adeptly leveraged these brands, particularly within the video game industry, to create both captivating games and innovative consoles. Its current hardware is the Switch, which in 2023 accounted for more than 96% of total revenue (hardware and software sales combined).Classic characters like Mario and Link consistently top the sales chart on Switch and other Nintendo consoles. This advantage is two-fold. First, it sets Nintendo apart by offering exclusive titles unavailable on Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Xbox or Sony's (NYSE:SONY) PlayStation. Second, these franchises translate to better profit margins, as evidenced by the data in the table below.A Cautious Perspective of NintendoSource: GuruFocusAnother factor that increases its margin is that the Nintendo Switch's hardware is inferior to that of the Xbox and PlayStation. It is estimated that a few years ago the Switch's production cost was around $257 and although the margin is not huge (given the price was around $299), it is already a major highlight compared to Microsoft, which lost up to $200 on each Xbox sold, and Sony, which, until a few years ago, was also losing money on the sale of its consoles.But this advantage has not always ensured robust sales and margins. At times, the company sold the Nintendo 3DS at a loss, as well as the Wii U. Between 2012 and 2014, the company recorded negative Ebit margins and a slowdown in revenue, only recovering with the launch of the Switch in 2017, which was boosted by games such as \"The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.\"Story continuesA Cautious Perspective of NintendoSource: KoyfinIn the last three fiscal quarters (April to December 2023) Nintendo showed a significant increase in revenue of 7.70% consolidated, explained by a 4.70% boost in the sale of video games, and a 93.40% increase in the sale of mobile and other IP-related income (such as \"The Super Mario Bros. Movie\" and other royalties). As a result, video game revenue slightly lost representation, reaching around 94% (all comparisons in Japanese yen).The image below shows another important division of its revenue, which is geographical. Although Nintendo is a Japanese company and part of its culture, almost 80% of sales come from other parts of the world, which mitigates some of the exchange rate risk. Of course, this risk still exists.A Cautious Perspective of NintendoSource: Nintendo's financial results presentationAs a Japanese company, Nintendo embodies a unique blend of tradition and innovation. The company culture, known for lifetime employment and a strong sense of hierarchy, fosters a long-term vision. This is evident in the continued influence of legendary game creator Shigeru Miyamoto. His active role on the board and involvement in projects like \"The Super Mario Bros. Movie\" and Super Nintendo World theme park showcases the company's commitment to both its heritage and future.A Cautious Perspective of NintendoSource: Nintendo IR WebsiteNintendo's financial health further strengthens its investment potential. The company boasts a robust capital structure, with a net cash position exceeding $14 billion. This translates to a lower enterprise value compared to its market capitalization, as traditional metrics like the price-earnings ratio might be skewed by not considering this significant cash hoard.This financial strength offers multiple advantages. First, it provides ample resources for developing new products and fueling future growth. Second, Nintendo's low debt level serves as a crucial safety net during economic downturns or similar challenges faced between 2012 and 2014. This financial resilience helps to safeguard the company's stability in the face of unforeseen circumstances. Finally, the strong financial position empowers Nintendo to consistently distribute dividends to its shareholders, as reflected in its current dividend yield of approximately 2.20%.A Cautious Perspective of NintendoSource: KoyfinIn short, Nintendo has important differentiators in the gaming market, which can often be summed up by its franchises with a very loyal audience, but also by its expertise in bringing out good games and reinventing itself. This enduring moat and long-term vision puts Nintendo on a different level (in a good way) in the gaming segment.Growth triggers and some risks to the thesisAs mentioned previously, much of Nintendo's moat is based on its intellectual property. In my view, both the growth triggers and the risks are strictly linked to the success the company will have in continuing to take advantage of this strength.There is no denying the Nintendo Switch's success. A confluence of factors likely fueled this, including its innovative hybrid design and competitive price point. However, the consistent delivery of acclaimed Zelda titles like \"Breath of the Wild\" and the recent \"Tears of the Kingdom\" have arguably been the most significant driver. Both of these games have sold very well, with the most recent one having sold over 20 million copies, and also acting as a draw for the console (given the exclusivity).But it turns out that the Nintendo Switch is already in its final phase of life, and there are expectations that the company will announce the next console (with speculation of a \"Nintendo Switch 2\"). While details about this upcoming console are scarce, rumors suggest it may debut in 2025 with hardware that falls short of some expectations.The uncertainty surrounding Nintendo's future console releases could significantly impact the stock performance. Whether the company can sustain or even exceed the success of the Switch with its successor remains uncertain, but it is a crucial factor for investors to monitor closely.That is why I also think the main risk is a loss of revenue or margins in its main market due to not being able to sustain the high level that the Nintendo Switch has brought.To mention a few optionalities that I find interesting, it is the growth of revenues in other media formats, such as new films (there are plans for a Zelda movie), series, mobile games and the like.My view is neutral for nowAs mentioned, I think Nintendo has an excellent business model with strong moats and can continue to grow if it succeeds in its initiatives. However, my view is cautious due mainly to two factors: the not-very-encouraging margin of safety and the still cloudy outlook for growth.In terms of the margin of safety, the company's multiples illustrate this well. Its price-earnings ratio of 16.20 and its enterprise value-to-Ebitda ratio of 9 seem low at first glance compared to other peers in the industry (such as Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA), Take-Two (NASDAQ:TTWO), Microsoft and others) and considering the company's premium quality. But considering all the uncertainties regarding the maintenance of its earnings in the coming years, they do not seem very attractive to me.A Cautious Perspective of NintendoSource: GuruFocusThis makes analysts foresee a downturn in revenue over the next couple of years, estimating a drop from $12.06 billion in 2023 to $10.50 billion in 2025. This market pessimism might just open up avenues for the company to surpass expectations in the foreseeable future. Success in launching new games, consoles and optionalities could position the company to surprise the market.While Nintendo remains a company I admire for its strong competitive advantages, the current valuation, coupled with some uncertainty around future performance, makes me cautious. To feel more confident about this investment, I need a clearer picture of Nintendo's potential for significant revenue and profitability growth in the next few years. Additionally, a wider margin of safety would be reassuring, as I currently view it as somewhat narrow. That said, Nintendo remains on my radar and I'm eager to see how the next few quarters unfold.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

games such as  the legend of zelda  breath of the wild  story continuesa cautious perspective of nintendosource  koyfinin the last three fiscal quarters  april to december 2023  nintendo showed a significant increase in revenue of 7 70  consolidated  explained by a 4 70  boost in the sale of video games  and a 93 40  increase in the sale of mobile and other ip related income  such as  the super mario bros  movie  and other royalties   as a result  video game revenue slightly lost representation  reaching around 94   all comparisons in japanese yen  the image below shows another important division of its revenue  which is geographical  although nintendo is a japanese company and part of its culture  almost 80  of sales come from other parts of the world  which mitigates some of the exchange rate risk  of course  this risk still exists a cautious perspective of nintendosource  nintendo s financial results presentationas a japanese company  nintendo embodies a unique blend of tradition and innovation  the company culture  known for lifetime employment and a strong sense of hierarchy  fosters a long term vision  this is evident in the continued influence of legendary game creator shigeru miyamoto  his active role on the board and involvement in projects like  the super mario bros  movie  and super nintendo world theme park showcases the company s commitment to both its heritage and future a cautious perspective of nintendosource  nintendo ir websitenintendo s financial health further strengthens its investment potential  the company boasts a robust capital structure  with a net cash position exceeding  14 billion  this translates to a lower enterprise value compared to its market capitalization  as traditional metrics like the price earnings ratio might be skewed by not considering this significant cash hoard this financial strength offers multiple advantages  first  it provides ample resources for developing new products and fueling future growth  second  nintendo s low debt level serves as a crucial safety net during economic downturns or similar challenges faced between 2012 and 2014  this financial resilience helps to safeguard the company s stability in the face of unforeseen circumstances  finally  the strong financial position empowers nintendo to consistently distribute dividends to its shareholders  as reflected in its current dividend yield of approximately 2 20  a cautious perspective of nintendosource  koyfinin short  nintendo has important differentiators in the gaming market  which can often be summed up by its franchises with a very loyal audience  but also by its expertise in bringing out good games and reinventing itself  this enduring moat and long term vision puts nintendo on a different level  in a good way  in the gaming segment growth triggers and some risks to the thesisas mentioned previously  much of nintendo s moat is based on its intellectual property  in my view  both the growth triggers and the risks are strictly linked to the success the company will have in continuing to take advantage of this strength there is no denying the nintendo switch s success  a confluence of factors likely fueled this  including its innovative hybrid design and competitive price point  however  the consistent delivery of acclaimed zelda titles like  breath of the wild  and the recent  tears of the kingdom  have arguably been the most significant driver  both of these games have sold very well  with the most recent one having sold over 20 million copies  and also acting as a draw for the console  given the exclusivity  but it turns out that the nintendo switch is already in its final phase of life  and there are expectations that the company will announce the next console  with speculation of a  nintendo switch 2    while details about this upcoming console are scarce  rumors suggest it may debut in 2025 with hardware that falls short of some expectations the uncertainty surrounding nintendo s future console releases could significantly impact the stock performance  whether the company can sustain or even exceed the success of the switch with its successor remains uncertain  but it is a crucial factor for investors to monitor closely that is why i also think the main risk is a loss of revenue or margins in its main market due to not being able to sustain the high level that the nintendo switch has brought to mention a few optionalities that i find interesting  it is the growth of revenues in other media formats  such as new films  there are plans for a zelda movie   series  mobile games and the like my view is neutral for nowas mentioned  i think nintendo has an excellent business model with strong moats and can continue to grow if it succeeds in its initiatives  however  my view is cautious due mainly to two factors  the not very encouraging margin of safety and the still cloudy outlook for growth in terms of the margin of safety  the company s multiples illustrate this well  its price earnings ratio of 16 20 and its enterprise value to ebitda ratio of 9 seem low at first glance compared to other peers in the industry  such as electronic arts  nasdaq ea   take two  nasdaq ttwo   microsoft and others  and considering the company s premium quality  but considering all the uncertainties regarding the maintenance of its earnings in the coming years  they do not seem very attractive to me a cautious perspective of nintendosource  gurufocusthis makes analysts foresee a downturn in revenue over the next couple of years  estimating a drop from  12 06 billion in 2023 to  10 50 billion in 2025  this market pessimism might just open up avenues for the company to surpass expectations in the foreseeable future  success in launching new games  consoles and optionalities could position the company to surprise the market while nintendo remains a company i admire for its strong competitive advantages  the current valuation  coupled with some uncertainty around future performance  makes me cautious  to feel more confident about this investment  i need a clearer picture of nintendo s potential for significant revenue and profitability growth in the next few years  additionally  a wider margin of safety would be reassuring  as i currently view it as somewhat narrow  that said  nintendo remains on my radar and i m eager to see how the next few quarters unfold this article first appeared on gurufocus ',

                        "The video game industry has come a long way from its roots, gobbling up spare change slotted into arcade machines. In 2024, the gaming market is expected to reach a massive $282.3 billion, and it's still growing.By 2027, forecasts predict video games will generate $363.2 billion. To achieve this size, gaming businesses have evolved to generate sales in multiple ways.Finding winning gaming stocks means identifying companies that have mastered the contemporary revenue landscape. Among the choices, these three businesses stand out: Electronic Arts (NASDAQ: EA), Take-Two Interactive Software (NASDAQ: TTWO), and Nintendo (OTC: NTDOY).Here's why these gaming stocks are worth buying now and holding onto as long-term investments.1. Electronic ArtsElectronic Arts possesses several qualities that make it a compelling investment. For starters, it's renowned for its sports games.This area of its business is so strong, its soccer franchise is flourishing despite severing a nearly 30-year relationship with soccer giant FIFA. In its fiscal third quarter, ended Dec. 31, 2023, EA's post-FIFA soccer games saw a 7% increase in sales even though the prior year got a boost from the World Cup.Another factor is EA's success with live services. This is additional digital content, released after a game is launched, that consumers can buy to enhance the base game.EA's live services sales reached a record $1.7 billion of the company's $2.4 billion in fiscal third-quarter net bookings, which is the company's revenue after adjustments. Live services income represented 73% of EA's net bookings over the trailing 12 months.Live services content is less costly to produce than video games, helping to boost EA's profit margins. As a result, the company's gross margin rose to 72.8% in fiscal Q3, up from 69.8% in the prior year.EA also generates strong free cash flow (FCF). Over the past 12 months, FCF nearly doubled year over year to $2.2 billion.These factors make EA stock a good investment, especially since shares have dropped from a 52-week high of $144.53 reached in February. With its next earnings release approaching on May 7, now is a good time to buy.2. Take-Two InteractiveTake-Two's strength lies in its pantheon of popular titles, most notably its Grand Theft Auto franchise. In March, the firm added to this strength with the acquisition of Gearbox Entertainment, the organization responsible for the popular Borderlands series, which will have a movie based on the franchise debuting in August.Story continuesTake-Two also acquired mobile gaming company Zynga in 2022. This supercharged Take-Two's mobile sales, which, before the acquisition, totaled $403.4 million in its 2022 fiscal year, ended March 31, 2022.Through nine months of fiscal 2024, Take-Two's mobile income represented $2 billion of the company's $4 billion in sales. Take-Two plans to expand live services across Zynga's games to grow its mobile revenue.The company's 2025 fiscal year began in April, the year CEO Strauss Zelnick promised Take-Two would \"enter our next phase of growth.\" A slate of new games is expected to drive this, including the highly anticipated Grand Theft Auto VI title to be released next year.But Take-Two shares dropped recently on fears of Grand Theft Auto VI launch delays. This creates a buying opportunity for investors with a long-term mindset.The consensus among Wall Street analysts is a median stock price target of $179.27 with an overweight rating. These factors make now a good time to pick up shares.3. NintendoVenerable Nintendo's ability to thrive despite the vagaries of the video game market makes it an attractive investment. Nintendo's success is thanks to beloved franchises, such as its Super Mario brand, as well as its consistent ability to produce hit platforms.Currently, that platform is the Nintendo Switch, which is still going strong after seven years on the market. The console contributed to Nintendo's 8% year-over-year sales growth to 1.4 trillion yen in its fiscal Q3, ended Dec. 31, 2023.Nintendo management described Switch's ongoing success as entering \"uncharted territory\" because it's the company's first console to maintain high sales volume into the seventh year of its product life cycle.Nintendo's software sales are also a bright spot. Revenue from digital games rose 12% year over year to 346.4 billion yen in the first nine months of fiscal 2024. Digital income is now approaching half of the Switch's total software sales.This leads to a higher gross margin since digital products lack the costs of manufacturing and shipping a physical game cartridge. Consequently, through three quarters, Nintendo's gross profit rose from 53.9% in the prior year to 55.8% in fiscal 2024.Not only is Nintendo's gaming business going strong, the company's income from its intellectual properties rose 93% year over year to 75.2 billion yen during the first nine months of fiscal 2024. This outsized growth was thanks to the success of last year's hit Super Mario Bros. movie.Nintendo is now working on a movie based on its popular Legend of Zelda franchise, and next year it will open a Super Nintendo World theme park in Florida. Eventually, the company's successor to its Switch platform will arrive as well. In the meantime, investors can benefit from Nintendo's dividend, currently yielding a robust 3%.Should you invest $1,000 in Take-Two Interactive Software right now?Before you buy stock in Take-Two Interactive Software, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Take-Two Interactive Software wasn’t one of them.

                        "Microsoft MSFT has announced that beloved video game franchises from Blizzard Entertainment that captured the hearts of millions in China will soon be making a comeback under a new publishing agreement with NetEase NTES.After a year of discussions, Blizzard Entertainment and Chinese Internet giant NetEase revealed that they have reached a deal to once again bring hugely popular titles like World of Warcraft, Hearthstone and games from the Warcraft, Overwatch, Diablo and StarCraft universes back to players in mainland China.The renewed partnership builds on more than 15 years of previous collaboration between the two companies. NetEase was the publisher of Blizzard games in China from 2008 to 2023.A number of Blizzard games were taken offline in China in January 2023 after the developer terminated the partnership with NetEase citing disagreement over intellectual property control. The pair subsequently sued each other. Tension eased after Microsoft acquired Activision Blizzard in October, which was followed by changes in management.While the timing and further details are still to be announced, the renewed agreement will allow Chinese players to regain access to games they previously enjoyed under the prior deal before it lapsed.Separately, Microsoft Gaming and NTES also announced an agreement to explore bringing new NetEase titles to Xbox consoles and other platforms as part of MSFT's commitment to bringing more games to more players around the world.Microsoft Corporation Price and ConsensusMicrosoft Corporation Price and ConsensusMicrosoft Corporation price-consensus-chart | Microsoft Corporation QuoteMicrosoft Teases Next-Generation Xbox Plans Amid StrugglesMicrosoft recently revealed the formation of a new team working on preserving Xbox's current library of games for future hardware, highlighting its importance to both Xbox and the gaming industry.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 12.9% year to date compared with the Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s growth of 11.4%.

Many modern games, particularly live service titles, are unplayable without an Internet connection and risk disappearing permanently when servers are shut down.MSFT's commitment to game preservation aligns with its strong track record of backward compatibility. The Xbox 360 backward compatibility program, which allows players to enjoy hundreds of popular Xbox 360 games on Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S consoles, remains one of the platform's most beloved features.Microsoft's identity as a platform owner has come under the strain of late as Xbox Series S/X console sales lag far behind Sony's SONY PS5 and Nintendo NTDOY Switch.Its decision to release some Xbox exclusive titles on PS5 and Nintendo Switch and a sore lack of triple-A exclusives on its own platform has left the company in a perceivably weakened position in the console market.Microsoft, however, boasts a strong portfolio of game studios, especially since its successful acquisition of Call of Duty maker Activision Blizzard last year in a $69 billion deal that set a record for takeovers in the video game industry. The combined entity ranks No. 3 among global games publishers, behind Tencent Holdings and Sony.The launch of Diablo IV on Xbox Game Pass has quickly made Xbox the game's most popular platform. Additionally, MSFT is preparing for the upcoming releases of highly anticipated titles, such as Hellblade II, Avowed and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, which are likely to bring much needed wind in Xbox's sails.While Microsoft has not revealed a launch window for the next generation of Xbox consoles, court documents from the FTC trial in June last year revealed that the company expects the next-generation Xbox and PS6 to launch in 2028.Story continuesWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

                        "Nintendo Co. (NTDOY) appears an attractive pick, as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). An upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices -- has triggered this rating change.The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company's changing earnings picture. The Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years is tracked by the system.Since a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near-term stock price movements, the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors. They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for Nintendo basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock PricesThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock.For Nintendo, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher.Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate RevisionsAs empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>.Story continuesEarnings Estimate Revisions for NintendoFor the fiscal year ending March 2024, this company is expected to earn $0.66 per share, which is a change of -4.4% from the year-ago reported number.Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Nintendo. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 4%.Bottom LineUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here >>>The upgrade of Nintendo to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

                        "The video game industry has taken a hit as layoffs have affected multiple companies. Video game stocks like Electronic Arts (EA) and Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) remain down year-to-date, but is there optimism on the horizon for the industry?Wedbush Securities Managing Director Michael Pachter joins Yahoo Finance to give insight into the health of the gaming industry and what investors need to know when adding gaming picks to their portfolios.Pachter explains why Ubisoft (UBI.PA) is a Wedbush top pick in the gaming sector: \"In that Activision-Microsoft (MSFT) merger, the UK regulators kind of stuck their nose in the middle of all of it, forced Activision to sell the global streaming rights to its content to somebody else and Ubisoft stepped in and astutely bought up those assets for not very much money. I think they're going to get big checks from Microsoft, growing every year for the next several years.\"For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode.This post was written by Nicholas JacobinoVideo TranscriptAs you talk about, the sort of steady revenues from these companies is they're not trading like they're doing well, right.We've seen most of them see slumps this year.So what why the disconnect uh because I think that the publishers have recognized over the last couple of years that they can't just throw anything out there that they have to provide really premium content in order to charge a premium price.And they've spent way too many of their resources expanding the brands.So having that holistic approach to, to FIFA, which is no longer called FIFA or to Call of Duty, you know, having a, a couple of uh free to play games to augment the premium game.And so what that means is that the smaller games kind of get left by the wayside and the gaps being filled, you know, by smaller publishers, consumers still want that stuff.It just doesn't pay off.So think about it, like the movie industry, we get more Marvel's Avengers and far fewer romantic comedies.That's what the publishers are starting to reconcile right now that they need to offer big Blockbusters and 360 you know, experiences where you're always playing mobile or, or free to play PC in addition to console Michael and just to follow up on Julie's point, you know, you look at EE A and take two both.Well, in the red so far this year are those names you want to buy here, Michael.Yeah, I like them both.Um, I'd say I probably like take two a little more.Um, we know that Grand Theft Auto is coming.It's already been announced that it's coming.Story continuesWe know it's coming in 2025.Um Even if the rockstar guys were to, to delay it, it'll be late 2025 early 26 and that is a many billions revenue enhancement.Um And I think the thing I like about it this time around is that Grand Theft Auto Online, which is the free piece of that game has been built knowing GT A six is coming.So they'll incorporate GT A six into GT A online.I think you get a boost to the free to play game in front of the release of GT A six.So I like take two a lot and uh unlike E A take two bought Zynga, they are well along in, you know, kind of diversifying their, their, their game uh offering into mobile, uh they have a big hit called Match Factory that nobody talks about.I'm, I'm about $300 into it already.It's a great game.My wife is and I'm also curious about Ubisoft, which reports, I think Wednesday it is after the close of trading.Um, this one doesn't have the sort of franchise like a Grand Theft Auto, uh, behind it, but it's one of the bigger studios here and you guys like that one as well, right?We do and, and for a different reason, I mean, that you're right that their biggest selling game is maybe 1215 million units compared to Call of Duty at 35 and Grand Theft Auto at over 100.So, you know, it's a much smaller developer.Um What we like about it is that they, they've kind of their lack of performance the last five years suggests that they're positioned to really perform well in the next couple of years, they've got a lot of content backed up and about to launch.So I think you're going to get a big spike in revenue and profitability.And then the other thing is in that Activision, Microsoft merger, the UK Regulators kind of stuck their nose in the middle of all of it forced Activision to sell the, the global streaming rights to its content to somebody else.And Ubisoft stepped in and astutely bought up those assets for not very much money.I think they're going to get big checks from Microsoft growing every year for the next several years.",

                        'In this article, we will discuss the 20 largest video game publishers by revenue in the world. This article will focus on recent industry trends and the largest publishers in the video gaming industry. If you want to skip our analysis, you can proceed to the section highlighting the 5 Largest Video Game Publishers by Revenue in the World.An Analysis of the Video Gaming IndustryAccording to a report by Precedence Research, the global video game market was valued at $224.9 billion in 2022, the market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.5% and is forecasted to reach $610.6 billion by the end of 2032. The video games market is expected to grow rapidly as the adoption of Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality (AR and VR) technologies offer unprecedented levels of engagement and realism to enhance the overall gaming experience. These innovations also attract a wider audience, including casual gamers and those who may not typically engage with traditional video games. Also, the rising preference for online gaming has massively fueled the demand for Free2Play (F2P) and multiplayer online (MMO) games, a trend that is expected to persist in the foreseeable future. North America is home to some of the world\'s largest and most influential game publishers in the world. However, in 2022, the Asia Pacific region dominated the video gaming industry with a market share of over 54%, as its population offers a substantial consumer base for the gaming industry. In contrast, North America held a share of 24%. The Asia Pacific region is expected to sustain its position for the forecasted period as disposable incomes and urbanization increase in countries like China and India. China is one of the largest contributors to the growth of the market. The Chinese government has recognized the economic potential of the video gaming industry and has provided support and policies that encourage its growth. However, there have also been periods of regulatory scrutiny and restrictions.Largest Publishers in the Video Gaming IndustrySome of the largest companies involved in publishing video games include Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTWO), NetEase, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTES) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTWO) is one of the largest video game publishing companies in the world. Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTWO) operates through various subsidiaries including Rockstar Games, 2K, Zynga, and Private Division. On February 8, Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTWO) announced revenue of $1.36 billion, for the three months ending on December 31, 2023. In-app purchases and popular games such as Grand Theft Auto V (GTA 5) and Grand Theft Auto Online, Red Dead Redemption series, and Toon Blast outperformed expectations. Commenting on the results, Strauss Zelnick, Chairman and CEO of Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTWO) said:Story continues"We achieved solid third quarter results, including Net Bookings of $1.3 billion. Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online, the Red Dead Redemption series, and Zynga’s in-app purchases, led by Toon Blast, exceeded our expectations, as we launched engaging new content, partnerships, and activations. This was partially offset by some softness in mobile advertising and sales for NBA 2K24."Grand Theft Auto VI (GTA 6) is one of the most anticipated games by Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:TTWO) subsidiary Rockstar Games. There has been a lot of talk about its release in early 2025. However, on March 29, Bloomberg reported that it is behind schedule and could be delayed until 2026. The reason behind the delays is that Rockstar Games is discontinuing remote work in April, and has made it compulsory to work from the office for all full-time employees, which may cause developers to leave their jobs. The launch of GTA 6 holds significant importance for Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTWO) as the GTA’s predecessor has sold more than 195 million units and is the second-best-selling game of all time. Here are some comments from Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:TTWO) Q3 2024 earnings call:"Now moving on to our guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter. We project net bookings to range from $1.27 billion to $1.32 billion compared to $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter last year. Our release slate for the quarter includes WWE 2K24 as well as Penny’s Big Breakaway from Private Division. The largest contributor to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Toon Blast, our hypercasual mobile portfolio, Empire & Puzzles, WWE 2K24, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online, Words with Friends and Match Factory!. We project recurrent consumer spending to decrease by approximately 5%, which assumes flat results for Zynga and a decline for NBA 2K with Grand Theft Auto Online, virtual currency and GTA+ membership are expected to be up."NetEase, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTES) is a Chinese internet and game publishing company. On February 29, NetEase, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTES) reported revenue of $3.68 billion, up 7% year-over-year, and gross profit of $2.4 billion, up 27% year over year, for the three months ending on December 31, 2023. Here are some comments from NetEase, Inc.\'s (NASDAQ:NTES) Q4 2023 earnings call:"For 2023, our net revenue from games and related BES were RMB81.6 billion, or 9% from 2022. Revenue accelerated even faster in Q4 to RMB20.9 billion, up 10% year-over-year. The additional growth was primarily due to increased revenue contribution from launch of new games, such as Justice Mobile, and sustainable development titles like Eggy Party. Revenues from mobile games continue to make up the lion\'s share of our game business, accounting to 77% of our total net revenue from online game operations in the fourth quarter, and 75% for the year. Youdao\'s net revenue for 2023 reached RMB5.4 billion, and were up 2% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, in the fourth quarter reaching RMB1.5 billion, primarily due to increased revenue contribution from Youdao\'s online marketing services."On March 27, NetEase, Inc.

Commenting on the gaming business Satya Nadella, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) said:“This quarter, we set all-time records for monthly active users on Xbox, PC, as well as mobile—where we now have over 200 million monthly active users alone, inclusive of Activision Blizzard King. With our acquisition, we’ve added hundreds of millions of gamers to our ecosystem, as we execute on our ambition to reach more gamers on more platforms.

                        'March remained a solid stock season, and all signs point to continued strength if you’re looking for stocks to buy in April. Though inflation seems mildly stickier than previously planned, most expect the planned rate cuts to go into effect later this year, creating continued market momentum that’s surprisingly hard to shake.We’re mostly past fourth-quarter and end-of-year 2023 earnings reports, and, across the board, most popular companies performed in line with or beyond expectations. That relative performance further reinforces April’s strong stock potential , even as we enter the comparatively slower period before summer spending begins in earnest.GigaCloud Technology (GCT)an image of a cloud imprinted on a circuit board lit up by blue circuit lights. AVCT stock. cloud computing stocksSource: Blackboard / ShutterstockGigaCloud Technology (NASDAQ:GCT) shares remained volatile through March, but the stock seems to be settling into a slower (but sustainable) upward trajectory over the past few weeks and setting it up among the best stocks to buy in April. Following an impressive earnings report earlier this month, the stock surged by 25% before retracting to below its pre-earnings level. Despite this volatility, GigaCloud’s superior earnings spotlight its potential to persist as a high-momentum stock, promising significant upside for investors.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsGigaCloud excels in providing a comprehensive B2B eCommerce solution that tackles the substantial challenges of product and inventory management, sourcing, and payment processing for medium-sized businesses. Its platform offers an active vendor marketplace, efficient shipment and freight management, warehouse storage, AI-powered fulfillment, and, importantly, secure cross-border payments. It’s one of those stocks to buy in April.Notably, GigaCloud’s price-to-earnings ratio is a modest 11x, well below the tech sector’s average of 36x. This discrepancy becomes even more striking when considering GigaCloud’s earnings growth; the company has succeeded in doubling its earnings per share across the last five quarters. It has also sustained a strong free cash flow per share while trading at just 1.5x sales, underscoring its exceptional value.Steel Dynamics (STLD)Hand pointing upward next to upward trend stock chart in purple and blackish blue lighting, symbolizes growth stocksSource: shutterstock.com/Lemonsoup14Value investors tend to view commodity-based companies as too risky, but Steel Dynamics (NASDAQ:STLD) proves an exception with its blend of traditional manufacturing and cutting-edge sustainability.As America’s third-largest steel producer, Steel Dynamics distinguishes itself not just through its scale but also via its commitment to sustainable manufacturing. The company’s emphasis on metal recycling not only bolsters its profitability by ensuring high-quality metals remain in circulation within global value chains but also supports wider environmental objectives. With an attractive total yield of 8.14%, STLD draws value-focused investors with its compelling valuation. Additionally, Steel Dynamics consistently rewards its shareholders, evidenced by a recent 8% dividend increase to $0.46 per share, marking five years of consecutive growth and maintaining a 100% quarterly payment rate during this time, highlighting its dedication to shareholder returns.Story continuesIn 2023, Steel Dynamics celebrated its second-highest revenue year, posting $18.8 billion in sales and $2.5 billion in net income. The company also showed its commitment to shareholder value by repurchasing 8% of its outstanding shares throughout the year, a substantial investment reflecting its confidence even amidst higher debt costs and the expensive nature of steel production. This makes Steel Dynamics a compelling choice for conservative investors looking for stocks to buy in April.Steelcase (SCS)Graphic of green and blue arrow against pale green background pointing up and to the right, symbolizing growth stocksSource: shutterstock.com/ex_artistWith an ex-dividend date on the horizon, high-end office furniture company Steelcase (NYSE:SCS) stands out among stocks to buy in April as a unique small-cap value play that wider markets overlook. The company is on a winning streak post-pandemic as it adapts to changing work-from-home trends. This success is highlighted by the company’s recent announcement of a $0.10 quarterly dividend, which represents a 61% payout ratio and a 2.88% yield.Steelcase has quickly regained its financial footing after a challenging pandemic period. Its latest quarterly report showed a net income of $30.8 million, more than double that of the same period in the previous year. Moreover, sales have remained consistent at around $800 million over the past five quarters, indicating that Steelcase is enhancing margins without compromising on quality.In response to the shifting work-from-home landscape, Steelcase is repositioning itself to achieve 5-7% annual sales growth and a 5% free cash flow margin (as a percentage of revenue) over the next five years. Concurrently, the company has significantly reduced its debt to adapt to the higher-rate environment, thereby improving liquidity and minimizing interest expenses. These strategic moves position Steelcase as one of the most promising stocks to buy in April.Nintendo (NTDOY)cloud gaming: Gamer Playing and Winning in First-Person Shooter Online Video Game on His Personal Computer. Strong Buy Gaming StocksSource: Gorodenkoff / Shutterstock.comNintendo (OTCMKTS:NTDOY) may be branching out from its gaming foundation, setting it up as one of the stocks to buy in April set to capitalize on multiple emerging trends. The company has recently renewed its licensing for haptic technology, suggesting advancements in line with last year’s rumors of a partnership with Google (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) to create a next-generation virtual reality headset. Though these rumors are unconfirmed, adding haptic feedback technology to Nintendo’s repertoire hints at significant innovations underway.Apart from its gaming ventures, Nintendo is leveraging its vast intellectual property portfolio through film licensing. The Super Mario Bros. Movie, released last year, was a blockbuster hit, generating over $1.4 billion at the global box office. Building on this success, Nintendo has announced an adaptation of Zelda, which is expected to achieve or even exceed the commercial success of the Mario film. Despite hardware delays that have postponed the release of its new console until early 2025, Nintendo’s flagship products continue to enjoy popularity, positioning the company as as one of the best stocks to buy in April.Stem (STEM)Coins stack of money on saving, the step of the financial stock market, graph and rows of coins, business investment on a green background, Economy stock market growth of financial recovery.

This significant step forward, particularly in the ongoing “higher for longer” economic climate, indicates that the stock is on track for growth as interest rates find a stable footing.SoFi is expanding its product range beyond its foundational banking and lending services to reinforce its standing as a full-service financial provider. The company has broadened its investment platform to encompass alternative investments, offering investors access to unique assets like private credit and venture capital through managed funds.However, not all outlooks on SoFi are rosy. Morgan Stanley recently downgraded the stock, citing an overly optimistic view of the company achieving its 2026 profitability targets amid forecasts of potentially slower revenue growth in 2024.Nonetheless, several factors contribute to a still-promising outlook for SoFi. With the stock trading significantly below its peak levels, it remains an attractive option for stocks to buy in April.Symbotic (SYM)Symbotic (NASDAQ:SYM), a mid-cap company, is revolutionizing warehouse operations for major corporations such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Target (NYSE:TGT). The company utilizes AI to streamline and enhance the efficiency of warehouse robotics platforms, enabling faster and safer selection, packing, and shipping of goods than traditional methods, all while saving significant costs for these companies. Although currently serving big-name brands, Symbotic’s strategy to broaden its reach promises to catapult the robotics stock to new heights. It’s one of those stocks to buy in April.The company is innovating to make warehouse automation and robotics accessible to small- and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) that previously could not afford the efficiencies available to giants like Walmart and Target. By targeting multi-user warehouse complexes and integrating automation as part of a leasing incentive, rather than selling directly to SMBs, Symbotic is tapping into the vast, largely untapped SMB market. This move could create a self-sustaining revenue model, transforming Symbotic into a powerhouse capable of generating significant long-term profit.On the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

                        'Struggling video game retailer GameStop (NYSE:GME) stock has seen a very protracted decline from the height of meme stock mania roughly three years ago. I know, it seems like it was just yesterday. Recent speculation has boosted GME stock by 17% recently.Much of this rise has to do with some very dovish commentary (relative to what the market was expecting) from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell.Anticipation around potential rate cuts (instead of hikes) pushed many investors to move up the risk curve.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsGameStop is about as far up the risk curve as you can go, hence the outsized move.This comes as GameStop has struggled to transition online, leading to an 18% stock drop after its recent disappointing Q4 2023 results.The company reported earnings of 22 cents, missing Wall Street estimates, with hardware/accessories down 12%, software down 31%. Sales decline due to online game purchases.Let’s dive into what to make of this very volatile price action in the stock, and whether investors are making a right move by trading this stock in either direction.Sliding Sales and GME StockIn addition to the aforementioned earnings numbers, a recent SEC filing also revealed that the company has laid off some of its workforce due to sales drops.This puts GME in a lousy light despite plans and hopes of boosting profitability through such cost-cutting measures.In Q4 2023, these cost-cutting initiatives were followed by declining sales. That makes sense – it’s hard to grow if you’re cutting locations and headcount, particularly in the retail world.From $2.2 billion, GameStop only saw a $1.7 billion in revenue for the quarter. Other console makers like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Sony (NYSE:SONY), and Nintendo (OTCMKTS:NTDOY), which shifted to digital downloads, greatly impacted GameStop’s sales.Downloadable video games have clearly negatively affected GameStop’s sales. Besides GameStop, its peers like Nintendo, saw a drastic drop in hardware sales of 7.8%.Analysts and investors also showed concern over Ryan Cohen, GME’s CEO, who plans to continue investing in cryptocurrencies and other blockchain-related stocks.They fear that this might cause a greater decline for the company, especially now that it has seen 39% decline since the beginning of 2024.Wedbush’s analysis forecasts GameStop’s demise by 2029 after poor Q4 results. More than cost-cutting is needed, with a yearly revenue drop of $150-$200 million.The retailer struggles to offset declining game sales, and until the cash burn stops and there’s a positive cash flow story to talk about, many fundamental investors will continue to avoid this name.Story continuesGames Are DepreciatingGameStop’s revenue fell in the holiday quarter because of e-commerce competition, reduced spending, and declining software sales. Inflation affected hardware, accessories, and collectible sales.As a meme stock, this is a company that’s trading based almost solely on speculative sentiment in the market at any given time.The fact is, the gaming market is depreciating in value. Most console operators sell these games online, and GameStop’s lack of a shift to another business model really reminds me of BlockBuster.I’m not alone, and that’s why the stock is so heavily shorted, which portends well for short squeezes.The thing is, given GameStop’s size relative to its true value, I think it’s going to be much harder for another squeeze to take place from a technical perspective.Better Sell GME Stock NowThis top meme stock certainly created a tremendous amount of buzz due to its 2021 short squeeze.However, with that debacle in the rear view mirror, it’s becoming more and more clear that this is a company that’s headed toward bankruptcy. I just don’t see a way out, other than a major pivot the company has yet to pursue.For those looking to ride this momentum higher, be careful. I think more downside is ahead over time, and it may be a slower and steadier bleed than many are anticipating.On the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Chris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years.

                        "Nvidia (NVDA) is joining its mega-cap tech peers, becoming the fourth Magnificent 7 stock to split since 2022.The chip giant’s 10-for-1 stock split, which will start trading on Monday, follows significant price growth, with shares up 212% in the past year. That massive rally pushed Nvidia into the $3 trillion club, becoming just the third U.S. company ever to reach that milestone.“A stock split is a vote of confidence from management that the stock will hold its value, as the stock [price] typically increases,” S&P Dow Jones Indices senior analyst Howard Silverblatt said.Winthrop Capital chief investment officer Adam Coons expects the split to boost retail investor interest, but cautions that an influx of retail traders could trigger volatility for the stock.“They can be a little bit more quick and emotional with their buying and selling decisions, so that can lead to heightened volatility as you start to dilute the institutional buyers,” Coons told Yahoo Finance.Evercore ISI's Julian Emanuel sees increased volatility as an opportunity to buy Nvidia — a stock he views as a “generational opportunity” and this era's \"marquee\" technology stock.“While high profile splits have often fueled stock volatility — speculative buying and profit taking around the event — Thinning the trees within the forest post-split catalyzes the Buying Opportunity for the patient investor,” Emanuel wrote.Historically, stock splits are typically bullish for the companies that enact them, with average returns one year later of 25% versus about 12% for the broad market, according to analysis from Bank of America.Nvidia’s skyrocketing gains have driven the broader market to record highs. Its rally accounted for about a third of the S&P 500’s return since the start of the year, and more than a quarter of the S&P 500’s return in the month of May, according to Silverblatt.Wall Street has gotten even more bullish on the stock since its earnings report on May 22. Last week, Bank of America’s Vivek Arya raised his price target to a Street high of $1,500.“We are at the start of what I think would be a decade-long conversion to accelerated computing … We think that the spending could be anywhere between $250 to $500 billion a year, and Nvidia is leading the charge,” Arya told Yahoo Finance.Nvidia’s stock split not only signals management’s confidence in the chip giant, but enthusiasm and optimism about the broader AI industry's growth potential.As Lam Research (LRCX) CFO Doug Bettinger explained to me at Bank of America’s Global Technology conference last week, we’re still “very, very early” in the AI investment cycle.Story continuesThat next round of growth — or the second wave of AI — is expected to take hold as companies begin to integrate AI into their planning and enterprise spending.“More and more companies are adopting hybrid-cloud architectures, and with a focus on building modern applications, and starting their journey into enterprise AI,” Nutanix (NTNX) CEO Rajiv Ramaswami told me.For investors looking to add to their portfolios, Arya likes Broadcom (AVGO), Marvell Technology (MRVL), Micron (MU), and Arm (ARM) as winners of AI’s continued wave. In a note to clients last month, Arya wrote that he sees increased requirements in computing, networking and memory as a “multi-year growth driver” for the group.Seana Smith is an anchor at Yahoo Finance.

                        "In this episode of the Best of Asking for a Trend, Yahoo Finance's Josh Lipton sat down with executives and experts in sectors such as AI, tech, retail, the auto industry, and cybersecurity, with guests including Palantir CEO Alex Karp (PLTR), Canaccord Genuity Managing Director George Gianarikas, EY Strategy and Transactions, Americas Vice Chair Mitch Berlin, CarGurus Director of Industry Insights and Analytics Kevin Roberts, Alex Mill Chairman and former Gap CEO Mickey Drexler (GPS), and Zscaler Chairman and CEO Jay Chaudhry (ZS).For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here.This post was written by Mariela Rosales.Video TranscriptWelcome to Best of asking for a trend.This show recaps and highlights today's trends that will shape tomorrow's market.We understand that with so many trends influencing the market and so little time to grasp them all, it can be difficult to digest.That's why we dive deep into the trends.So you don't have to.Here are the key trends you should keep an eye out for.I'm Josh Lipton and I am here now with Punier Ceo Alex Carp for this exclusive Yahoo finance interview here at A IP con.This is the company's customer conference.Alex, thanks for taking the time to chat.Very happy to be here.So today there's gonna be more than 250 of your customers and they're gonna be here, Alex talking about A IP.This is your flagship A I platform.Let's start there, Alex for, for many viewers who aren't as familiar what is a IP, how does it work and how are businesses leveraging it?Right?Iii I think what everybody watching this is familiar with is you have a massive he cycle around large language models and then when you try to use them in your enterprise.You find out that it's more like self flagellation and it's expensive with no output.And what we learned in the context of war fighting primarily but also across the uh 20 years of building uh software infrastructure were how do you manage an emergent natural resource called large language model uh models in a way where you actually get value, meaning you can transform your enterprise, you can change the margins, you can turn tech non technical people into technical people on the battlefield.You can do things that would have otherwise cost billions of dollars for millions of dollars.Meaning being very precise in how you allocate troops, being precise in how you target people.Um There's a fundamental fallacy around large language models.People could conflate uh actual data of an enterprise which is structured and can be taken apart and understood with a large language model which is much more like an emergent property, something that is can be modeled used, but you need precision and all the value in the market is going to go to chips.Story continuesAnd what we call ontology, we have this ontology and the ontology will allow you to take a large language model and use it, refine it and then impose it on your enterprise in the logic of enterprise and the security model of your enterprise.And what does that mean for the 7070 people are here presenting talking about why they're using it, how they're using it.You gotta remember we started uh selling this product just over a year ago.Uh We started with the claim that we knew a lot about the precursors of large language models and large language models.And the general approach of just buying models is going to be essentially self pleasuring for an enterprise at the cost of the enterprise and no one believed us.And now you see 70 people saying, hey, we're using this for construction, we're using it for hospitals.Uh the people who are not speaking, but we're using it on the battlefield.We're using it to compress margins.We're using it to build enterprises that we're only able to build in Asia and America.We're making engineers uh better engineers.We're making people are not engineers into engineers using our anology and a large language model.And this works very, very quickly and it is substantially changing the health and vitality of every business here as opposed to the alternative, which is that you buy some large language model, you, you party with it basically.And the next day you have a hangover.And, and then, and so like and again, for, for people just looking at this, what does it mean for palant here?It means we are sitting on the only thing that actually creates uh a quantifiable transformational value in an enterprise.Yes, it is not understood well, because everybody understands the problem incorrectly.Yes, it is going to transform America and our clients are leaving the way and, and by the way, it's like to actually show things that are not understood.You have to actually show them the whole purpose of this conference is I can tell you how an ontology works.It's actually quite simple.You have the logic of the business, you including the security logic of the business and you have something that it approximates new knowledge in a new form called a large language model.And it allows you to take the value of the new form, the raw resource of a large language model, largely powered by chips and put it into a precise organization in the logic of the business.I can tell you that where I can show you 70 businesses say my business is stronger, healthier and much better than any other business in my sector.And so what is the bottom line for investors listing Alex?How would you characterize what is commercial demand like right now for a IP the way I would explain it to my most important investors, which are individual investors.There's two parts of the market that are creating value.People will pay for chips and ontology and you understand the chip side now and now you're going to understand and what does that mean for your business?It means you can actually use this raw resource and process it into something that actually works.And if you want to see exactly how, what the people presenting, you're going to see people in construction, using it to build buildings quicker, cheaper, more accurately, you're going to see people in the hospital industry saying, how could I possibly ever distribute my patients ethically fairly and commercially relevantly, how could I distribute resources across?How can I manage my my company as not abstract units but as a portfolio.These are, these things are happening within days.What I'm interested in the Alex is because you, you can talk a lot of CEO S will say and they'll sit on your finds, they're interested in A I but actually they're not willing to pull the trigger yet because they have these questions about privacy, security vs but, but you're saying we're crushing it.We're closing A I, what I would tell any of them is how are you doing it?Well, there's a technical answer which I gave you the precursor of, but again, do you wanna know how we're doing it or do you wanna enjoy it being done?Both?Great.Well, first, you, but no, actually, first you wanna see it works like the, the, the, the central issue I think, I mean, we have hundreds and hundreds of CEO S and by the way, the thing about the 70 people here presenting is, you know, they're presenting to other people.I'm not paying them to present.The reason they're presenting is they're like, wow, I didn't really believe this could work.And now it's working really well.So the most important thing, by the way for a normal user, someone who's gonna pay is does it work?Then the second question is how does it work?Does it scale?What is the commercial model you really have to establish it works?I would stand by the thing that it, in this case is people think of large language models as the value in of itself.What they're gonna find is the large language model is much more like a chemistry experiment.The outgrowth of which is a something that is useful when refined and the refinement of that for your enterprise happens in what we call our ontology, which is where we impose the logic of your business on large language model in the security and intellectual logic of your business.And this is transformative and what it means for investors and others is there is value in this market.People, you can identify where the value is very easily.Are people paying for it?Will they pay for it?And what will there's a prey to optimality to a lot of this stuff?And that prey to optimality happens when people say, oh, I am actually getting value and that's why people are here.Let me ask you, you suggest I wanna broaden the conversation because you kind of suggested this just give your take on the moment we're in because there's some Alex you've heard who say listen, this is a historic moment.Internet mobile.And now A I NVIDIA Jensen Wong said the next industrial revolution has begun.Do you agree with that?You agree with Jensen?Um I think you're gonna have very divergent for some people.This is the next generation and for others who I think they're doing very similar things.It's gonna fail.Who defines the winners?Who will be the winners?Well, come talk to our 70 customers, they think they're winning.It's like, you know, you look, it's a lot of this goes back to basic ideas of how you build things.Why you gotta talk to people who are getting value and ask them, how are you getting value?Why are you getting value?Are you paying more or less for that value than you think you should?And that's exactly what you're gonna see today.You're gonna see people saying I'm getting a lot of value.It went much quicker than I thought.I'm, I'm outstripping what I thought I could do.I'm better, much better than the people.It happened efficiently.And I'm probably, I don't think they'll say this, but I'm paying less than I think I should.And that's why I'm very happy about it.Let me get your t too, when we talk about A I, we got to talk geopolitics.I'm very curious to get your answer to this question.Who is in pole position, us or China?Well, we have a very different problem in the us than any other country in the world.We are in pole position, but we obviously have to move much, much quicker.Um You see on the battlefield and again, uh without mentioning uh where these things are used.Exactly what I'm talking about.Large language model plus ontology is can be wielded as a very deadly weapon and create enormous efficiencies for uh especially small armies against large armies.Um We have to be myopically focused in this culture of, we are in a pre war situation with our adversaries and we can no longer afford the theologies about what works on the battlefield.We have to go very deep and look at what's happening on battlefields and do a diagnostic of it.It's much less critical, but it's the same thing that businesses have to do what is working, what is not, not a theological thing of what would I like to believe is working and what works on the battlefield where our central advantage is uh as the United States of America, the leader of the West and the most important country in the world is technology, venture backed companies and especially software and software driven weapon systems.And how, how do you get the software to control the hardware so that we can, we can get out of the business of trying to compete with people who are better at hardware and get into the business of producing something they do not produce as well.Comes down to execution.The problem we have in the West actually is again, is prey to optimality.The, the the products that actually scare our enemies are, are just not products that employ mill millions of people.They, but they still are deadly.They are software driven hardware systems.Moving to software driven autonomous hardware systems.One of the biggest lessons of war and one of the reasons this is so crazy, valuable is the Russians and all of our adversaries have now learned the value of electronic warfare.By the way again, these things are exactly isomorphic to commercial.You have enormous new headwinds, the commercial, your competition has developed something that renders your product strategy irrelevant.You have to rebuild it with a new playbook.This is exactly what happens on the battlefield.You cannot use a normal missile or normal tank on the battlefield anymore because the electric warfare, electronic warfare allows you to suppress the GPS signal.And that means these things have to be controlled uh with software to go around map where the electronic, where the suppression happens.And then in the final mile at some point, autonomously, completely different ways of doing a I completely different news ways of doing it.All of which are an advantage to America.If we implement just like in American industry, we have something called a chip industry that is the world's leading in this area.And or at least the, the, the final product and we have something called software ontology, which actually makes all of this crazy valuable.Do you implement it?Do you go talk to people are doing it or do you read the powerpoint written by someone who has no skin in the game?And, and, and the answer to that determines whether America in the West, which I view as a superior way of living because it's fairer better meritocratic leads to free speech allows for wealth creation.Does that culture actually dominate and win?And we by the way have to get out of the apologizing for our culture thing.It's like we are a better way of living and we have to be willing to fight for it on the economic front with growth.That's why this conference is so important.We need growth.What makes America different than our adversaries right now is not just Western system, we have growth.Where is that growth coming from technology?What is that technology?It's compute plus ontology basically.And that can change the very structure of our culture from manufacturing to weapon systems to how we organize things to our health care distribution can have a completely different way and better way of living.Let me ask you this, you, you're talking about A I and we're talking about the benefits, the advantage of the use cases.I am also interested.I was to get your take on when you think about the risks of this technology.Let me put one forward.We have an election coming.How concerned are you as an American executive, but also just an American citizen about the very adversaries we're talking about here deploying A I for nefarious purposes rampant to sow confusion and division and there's only one way to fight uh uh uh uh a deadly adversary.What is that with a deadly set of weapons?So like if you, you know, if you wanna fight our adversaries and by the way, my version of fighting is you're so strong, you're so willing to fight, they don't fight you.So it was like, I recently have gotten in trouble for saying I'm a peace activist.I am a peace activist.I'm a peace activist because I want enormous growth in America and I want real deadly weapon system.You want peace in the world.You have a lot of growth in America and you have really deadly weapon systems and you tell your adversaries, you know what I just might use them.I'm not even going to explain why I'll use them.You start acting up, I will use them.You don't act up, I through strength, peace through strength and a little bit of unpredictability.You know, we are in a world where our adversaries are founders, they have the founder playbook, which is I'm gonna, I'm gonna be aggressive and win where I can.We have a playbook written probably at Harvard and Yale and Stanford Institutions which are now symptomatic with not producing, producing structures where they don't see discrimination when it in front of you producing structures that and ideologies that are literally built for the decline of our country.We need to get out of the business of we're declining.We're apologizing, we're not going to use force we needed.And the peace activists are actually us and the pe people who claim to he's activists are actually sowing destruction disorder discrimination.It's an exact inversion of what they claim to be.And we, and we, but those of us on our side who are pro growth, pro America, pro our economy transfers and pro having the best systems in the world.We need to organize, build things and then we also need to have exact understanding of what works, what doesn't and implement it very quickly.I I mentioned the election.I want to stick with that real quickly.Does it matter to palent here who wins Biden or Trump?Does that impact any potential business you're going to have with the US government?Look, we've been in, we've dealt, we've been in business for 20 years.I have not seen an impact on our business, depending who's president.I am interested.Listen, we talk about these conflicts around the world right now.Running hot.Russia, Ukraine, Israel Hamas has that changed how the dod dod thinks about spending out and what they want to spend on.Uh The dod is changing rapidly, how it's been So, uh well, there's much more of a focus you saw that we won this big maven contract.Um These things are a natural growth, uh outgrowth of we need to fight better.We need to fight quicker.We need to fight on the terms where America has superiority.Of course, we can move quicker.Of course, the dod wants to move quicker.Our society wants to move quicker.I think unfortunately, we are going to end up moving even quicker because our adversaries are likely to continue their nefarious acts which Russia, China, Iran, I mean, all three are working together.You know, one of the things I I just, I just II I travel around the world and basically wherever you go, people are like, well, I want you to, I want, I want you to be strong on this one and appease the other people who believe in appeasement, whether it's Iran, China, Russia, pick your favorite, the one you're sympathetic with.They don't understand.We have adversaries there working together despite what you problems, you may have.Some people don't like the war in Ukraine.Some people don't like Israel.Some people want an appeasement strategy with China.It doesn't work, they are working together against us and we have to work together against them.Last question you mentioned, Maven, I wanted to get the dod recently disclosed and this is a five year $480 million contract with Pal.Just walk.What is that contract?What is it?What does it mean for your company?I never know what we're allowed to say about these very sensitive contracts.But I, I'll tell you what it means for the nation.This country is focused on using A I to have a structural advantage in how we deploy and understand the battlefield, deploy our assets and understand the battlefield.And P here plays a crucial role in that, in that arena.We're gonna continue to play a crucial role in that arena.And by the way, we're making it possible through our software to allow other software and hardware companies to work off of our platform.So this is not just a win for Pollinger though.It is and I'm very proud of it.This is a win quite frankly for the tech ecosystem that powers this nation.How big is that ecosystem now, which has grown a lot since we first started talking, the, the, the venture capital world has completely flipped when we talked the last time by and large, the tech company co community was adversarial to palant here on this issue of supporting our nation.Now, I think the tech community is the most, most supportive part of our economy in, in, in protecting our nation.And why did that?Why did that flip, by the way?Hey, you know, they stopped hating the player or the game, Alex Carp.I know you are very busy today.We appreciate your time.Thank you.Take care.Electrical grids across the country are feeling the pressure from the A I boom.Our next guest says something's got to give for more.Bring in George Generic managing director at Canon Court genuity.Thanks so much for being here, George.Um This is something we've been talking about a lot, right?This huge demand for A I, the huge demand for power that comes along with it.But of course, there's also a lot of talk about grid security, sort of around the country and resiliency and whether it's going to be able to keep up with this.So where are the sort of the pain points in your view?Well, thanks for having me on.So we wrote a note last week that was inspired by a report from CT which is the Electric Reliability Council of Texas.It's the organization that operates their electric grid down there.Uh And like your other guests, probably we've written a lot about the potential for a ID centers to tax the energy grid.But we, what we appreciate about the study from Ercot is it's one of the few that we've actually seen that in a granular way, tries to quantify what the impact could look like.You know, the study was inspired by a bill in the Texas legislature that demanded Ercot analyze the impact of things like data centers on grid reliability as a winter storm in 2021 significantly impacted the grid and resulted in deaths and what the study found that was starting in 2028 2029 2030 in both the winter and summer.The curve margins which is this buffer that they try to create to make sure that they can handle peak loads would turn negative.And that is clearly not something that they want to do.So, either they have to add significant energy ener energy generating assets to the grid or the demand for all this A I related hardware that people are buying has the down.And like we say in our notes, something's got to give there.Well, it doesn't seem like the latter thing is gonna happen necessarily, right?At least not in the short term.Are there any plans though in the works?I mean, you know, I feel like for years now we've been talking about R CT, we've been talking about the grid problems in Texas specifically because of heat waves because of other winter storms as well, winter weather.So is anything ha is anything giving on that side?So there are plans to add significant energy generating assets, whether it's solar, whether it's stuff and with battery technology and even longer term.And we're very bullish on the potential for nuclear technology, particularly small modular reactors that help create baseload clean energy across the country.And we cover a company called new scale ticker symbol, Smr that hopefully over the next several years, we start to win uh some uh some contracts to build out the energy infrastructure in the United States for data centers.And, and it seems like regional, this is really a regional issue.We talked to another um analyst yesterday who covers the utility industry.And she kind of said, well, it depends on where you're talking about.Maybe in a place like Texas, you would have an issue, but there is sort of ample capacity in other places.I guess the question is whether data center operators are gonna try to locate in those places that do have more capacity.Yeah, that, that's a very fair point.I mean, in Texas that there's a lot of cheap green energy.So companies are putting their data centers there, you know, traditional parts in the Mid Atlantic, you know, we know some places in Ohio.So yes, it's, it's kind of geography specific.But ultimately, you know, if you, the more data centers you add the more EVs you add to the grid, it will begin to tax it.And I thought this particular study was alarming just because you get to these this potential negative reserve margin scenario that's very, very dangerous for, for their grid and for the country.And so, you know, and like I said, you know, there are, we, we followed up that note that we wrote with the uh basically uh calling out some posts yesterday or two days ago from Elon Musk and someone else who went back and forth on X that basically said these companies are buying so much of this A I related hardware.They don't know where to put it, you know, and that's sort of creating an issue there too.So it's not just having to put the energy generating assets in the ground.It's also finding a where, where to put all this A I related hardware that, that they're buying.And so there seems like there's this potential for an air pocket as all these ambitious plans to create, you know A I data centers meet the realities on the ground of building data centers, buying energy generating assets, getting permits, finding labor.This is all the real world stuff that might slow down the uh the A I related stuff, right?And not to mention, maybe have an effect on our electricity bills as well, potentially, even though it is regulated industry, you know, we've already seen that kind of an increase.So George, as you mentioned, you kind of look at it as well through the prism of who could benefit from all of this, not just like where is it gonna create bottlenecks?As you were just discussing, you talked about one idea, one company that might be poised to benefit.Are there other sort of, you know, grid resiliency operators or alternative power operators that you're looking to here?Certainly, you know, we cover a company called a Maresco uh that basically a clean tech integrator that should benefit, you know.Uh Although they're not quite seeing demand from data centers yet that we're seeing some early signs from that same thing for a company we cover called fluence that hasn't really seen yet that, that data center demand, but they're starting to see the inklings of it.And also if you want to buy a generator for your home to make sure that it's uh it's safe from any issues with the grid.You buy Genack, GNRC, uh they make the generators that basically serve as backup power for residences and for, you know, for some uh commercial industrial applications as well.A recent survey from EY reporting that us corporate M and A deal volume will increase by 20% from this year to next.And the outlook is, it's only going up from there.We'll have the author, we have the author of that survey joining us now, Mitch Berlin Strategy and Transactions Leader at Ey Mitch.It's good to see you.Thanks for being here.Hi, Julie, thanks for having me.So I feel like the conventional wisdom for a while was the rates would really have to start to move down more meaningfully before we saw an uptick.Well, in a lot of stuff, right, in housing activity, but certainly M and A was on that list.So is that what we need to unlock things or are people sort of chomping at the bit to get deals done anyway here.Well, it's a little bit of both Julie.We need, we do need the rates to come down a bit.You know, when we started the year, we thought that we'd have about six different decreases in the fed borrowing rate.Now we're expecting about two, but that's offset by the overall confidence in the market.Corporate profits are high.We have CEO confidence at an all time high.99% of the CEO S we surveyed in a recent interview uh in a recent survey said that they plan on doing a deal at some point in fiscal 24.And we're looking at GDP growth about 2.5% which is a little higher than initially predicted.So we are expecting the market to come back despite that, despite the fact that we probably won't get, we know we won't get six cuts in interest rate, maybe more about two mitch, what are some of the motivations that you're hearing from in terms of why uh companies are going after deals?Well, part of it is that, you know, a lot of these corporations have been, let's talk about corporate, then we'll talk about pe corporate has been sitting on the sidelines for about the last year and a half, but they need to transact to transform, to try to transform through organic means, just takes too long.The pace of transformation is too fast.So they really do need to do some sort of M and A to be able to continue to stay pace and or stay ahead of their overall competition, they're looking to gain market share.So you see a lot of deals where they're hiring competitors to gain market share, they're looking for product expansion.So particularly if you look at Life sciences, they have M and A patents that are coming to exploration, they need to increase their or I'm sorry, they have um they have patents that are expiring.So they actually need to build our R and D pipeline.And so they're looking to increase that through M and A, you have capacity expansion.If you look at the oil and gas industry and the, and the consolidation around the basin and then tech is the largest, the largest sector that's doing transactions a year over year and this year is no exception.And that has a lot to do with all the emerging A I technology that companies are trying to acquire as, as well as cyber, cyber technology to protect the data that they need to actually drive the A I that they're acquiring.Mitch.I wanna dig more into some of the sectors in a minute.But first, I, I also want to dig into the timing, you know, we talked about when rates might be coming down and what effect that could have.But the election also, I imagine is something of a factor.Are we seeing sort of a rush of desire to get deals done at least announced if not closed before the presidential election.Well, if you look at history in the last two elections, M and A started high the in the first quarter of the election and then it sort of tapers off towards the end of the year.It's hard to determine whether that has to do with the election or just the normal M and A cycles where it's a little bit slower in the fourth quarter of the year.This year may be different because, because there are clearly different attitudes and M and A between the different parties.And so you have a party right now with the DOJ and FTC, that's putting a lot of scrutiny on deals if that party is out of office and the, and, and the Republican party comes in, there is potential for less scrutiny from the doj and FTC.What people falsely think is that the, the interest rates are um will be impacted by the election, but the fed is really independent of whatever governing party is in.So the, the fed will not increase or reduce or hold rates flat depending on the party, they're independent.But I do think there are some emotional reactions around that that are actually imagine that Mitch.Um But at the same time as you referred to, right?This DOJ has been pretty active.Is that something that um clients that folks you're talking to are taking into account whether they even decide whether they pursue a deal in the first place.In other words, has that put a damper on things over the past couple of years?Well, we, we certainly talk about it with their clients truly.But what they're doing, it's not, it's not scaring them away from doing deals, but I think they're more cautious in how they're doing deals.And so what we're working with them on is look at the current structure of this deal doesn't work because it's gonna be perceived as you dominating a certain product category or a certain geography.How can we restructure that deal?So you still get that return on investment, but maybe it's a little bit of a different structure that will satisfy the doj and FTC guidelines.So it's not discouraging them.It's just there, we're, we're working with our clients to create more scenarios than we have in the past.Um Unless I, I do wanna dig more into energy in particular because there, the deal activity has just been a lot, right?Because it's not just the number of deals, it's the size of the deals that we have seen of the ones that have been announced.Um I believe only one of the large ones has closed in the form of Exxon um and uh pioneer, there's still a lot are a lot that are pending.Um Do you think that we've kind of come to the end of that flurry of activity in that industry.We have now come to the end.I think there's still a lot of big deals in the pipeline.I think we'll continue to see what we're gonna continue to see more.These, particularly in oil and gas, oil and gas balance sheets are flush with cash.Um, so it's, it's a lot easier than to do deals because they don't have to go to, uh, the, the syndicated market to actually finance these deals through debt.As a matter of fact, if you look at the last 20 if you look at the largest 20 deals in 2024 only three of them, this is across all industries, many of those deals over oil and gas, only three of those deals actually went to the debt markets to fund those deals.The rest were funded through cash or stock.It was a busy day for the auto sector carmakers reporting monthly sales for May and Ford was a standout rising 11% compared to a year ago.But if you look at hybrids and EVs sales of those vehicles soared 65% from last year.Joining me.Now, Kevin Roberts Cargo is director of Industry insights and analytics.Kevin, it is great to have you on the show.So listen, I looked at these for numbers, Kevin and, and you know, they look solid us auto sales.They popped 11% in May from a year earlier.But you are the pro Kevin.So walk us through it.Give give me your reaction to this report.Yeah.So we're seeing new inventory continue to grow and that's really helping to improve new vehicle sales.And you're seeing that with the top line numbers, uh obviously the hybrid and EV numbers are coming from an overall kind of smaller base compared to internal combustion engines, but definitely seeing positive growth there.And I think the really interesting trend is that, you know, for so many years, it was all the focus was on evs.And now I think hybrids are really starting to get their chance to shine uh in this spotlight and really look like they might be kind of the goldilocks kind of opportunity for consumers out there as we transition away from, you know, fossil fuels to electric vehicles.Now, that's interesting, Kevin, because hybrids are hot and, and you kind of characterize there as goldilocks.Why are they popular, Kevin?And how is Ford kind of um capitalizing on that trend?Yeah, so hybrids tend to be at a price point that's somewhat in between uh EVs and internal combustion engines.So affordability is always a key fact for consumers when they're looking at vehicles.So the affordability is there and then you deal with the fact that uh ranging and kind of concerns about the overall usability of evs and charging and our charging infrastructure and all that really kind of kind of holds back some of that kind of ev adoption where with hybrids, particularly hub plug in hybrids, you can get kind of the best of all worlds where you get the kind of uh reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and some of the utility that you get with evs.But then you still have that internal combustion engine uh around for longer road trips and the like that can really be beneficial for consumers.And let's talk about evs too.Kevin, you mentioned it there.What is Ford's sort of tactic and strategy with that market?It doesn't seem like it's a volume game.Is it a cost gunning game?What's the move for them, Kevin?So what we've been seeing Ford do is we look at the, you know, which models are seeing the largest kind of price declines and particularly with the Ford F 150 lightning and the Mustang mach E, we've been seeing some pretty significant price declines on those new EV models.And I think what you're seeing is as that price kind of gets reduced, consumers are showing much more kind of interest on that front.We've seen that a lot with used dvs, in particular, the prices for UDVS have dropped quite significantly and as the prices really start to slow down for EVs adoption and interest really starts to pick up in line with that.And Kevin, I just want to get your thoughts on E the EV market in general not seeing the growth.Kevin that we used to.What do you see ahead?What jumpstarts this market?Yeah, I, I think we're kind of in a kind of res resettlement period right now with evs where we had a lot of the early adopters who were very enthused to get into evs.Now we're starting to get into that more kind of mainstream adoption.I think it's a couple things, uh, range is less of an issue than I think what people think it really comes down to charging the charging infrastructure needs to get much more in place for consumers to adopt a little bit more and the cost needs to come down, there still is a pretty significant cost premium for evs.And once we get down to relative cost parity between evs and internal combustion engines vehicles, I think we'll see a much more uh faster adoption rate.But until we get that charging infrastructure in place and the cost in line, I think it's gonna be a little bit more of a difficult challenge and that's where hybrids can really come in and help the auto manufacturers out.Kevin, I wanna get you out of here on this.Listen, we talked evs, we talked hybrids, give me your take on, on pickups beyond for just industry wide, Kevin, as you look at that category, how healthy, how resilient.Yeah, I mean, it's, it's definitely still really healthy from a sales volume point of view, but we are seeing as those inventory numbers I mentioned continue to grow.We're seeing much more pickups get into the marketplace.And so it would be really interesting to see if automakers are able to balance that kind of demand and production without having to uh increase incentives too much to kind of move those vehicles that are sitting on lots.The results are in from major retailers signs point to consumers on the hunt for savings as discretionary income is pinched here by prolonged inflation and we know higher interest rates too.Meanwhile, retail earnings from names such as Abercrombie and Fitch delivering a shining quarter despite a tough consumer, we're spending backdrop for more on how to read the current state of retail.We have the perfect guest Mickey Drexler, Alex Mill chairman and former Ceo of Gap Mickey.Great to see you.I say perfect guest Mickey because we were talking off camera.You've got earnings season largely behind you.A lot of retail names and, and, and you, you got a lot of reports and conference calls CEO S CFO S is an investor trying to get a sense of where this sector is at.And we were talking, I said generally my gut was it seems decent, but you're the guru.Well, I I'm not the guru because I make a lot of mistakes between, ok.So um I do my service before I appear to talk about the industry.Uh and I called them a bunch of people and this counters, designers and all that.I think it's selectively good.I don't think it's all or nothing.I think quarterly reports.I've learned this after running gap and J Crew public companies for years, quarter to quarter.And I asked about color.I looked, I wanted to get some color on the discounting today.And inflation is crazy when you do these surveys.This is Nicky Drexler.You're going into the stores.No.Well, I go online.Is it a online tells you how much goods are on sale, how, what percentage is off and all that.But I've been saying, first of all, inflation to me is kind of a nightmare.Still travel.Uh Your point is in that it's increasing at a slower rate, but of course, it's still increase on top of 40 year highs.You know, the government doesn't have people going to the supermarkets going to fashion stores and shopping.You actually need food and gas, you're saying?No.Yeah.But, but how did they know it's slowing in apparel?Uh I hear mostly complain.Well, I hear complaints about everything, designer prices.Uh It's stunning to a lot of people, even those who can afford it because the rate of increased prices is hugely high and there's no, uh doesn't seem to be a letting down.I told that the designer business, whatever it means is kind of slowing down.But uh if you look at quarter to quarter, pick, pick your spots and I'm, I'm a merchandise product.That's what I look at long term.And is that a concept that's gonna work?That's the unexpected that sees around corners.Uh, and I don't hear a lot of, or see a lot of that designers, in my opinion, it used to be when I was a young guy, you know, you go to get Gucci Buckle shoes and it was like a kind of a deal.And today, I don't know where I'm not, I'm not for the Manor Born, but I don't know where people don't buy designer clothes.At what level and the weights for the be and it's mostly accessories from what I know and accessories are kind of like carrying around a little logo or maybe a bigger logo.But um I think uh I, I think you buy goods, you buy the styles, you buy the products, you buy service.And as I warned in a, I forgot where I was quoted.I said if I were a consumer today buying a para, I would actually, before I gave them the credit card, I go online and see where I could get it at a better price.Almost like a commodity in a way.I know that sounds weird.But there's so many different price uh issues and a lot of companies now have an online deal and if you're a customer, you slept to the store, you don't know about the online deal unless you know about it, then they'll honor that.So, retail, not an easy one.I'm not a, a good investor really because uh but I'm impressed.Well, not a lot of people I always mention TJ Maxx because Carol's a great merchant and you know, you go and that's the real price.Let me ask you, you mentioned TJ Max.I would love to get your take on gap as well because they report Mickey, they knock it out of the park.Stock is a monster over the last 12 months.What are your thoughts on that name?Well, uh, good for them.All right.Uh But three months if you've been in the stock, right.Well, I, I used to be in the stock but that was a long time ago.Uh I, I think that obviously perceived to be doing a good job.Uh I don't pay much attention.Um, I did include a gap in my percentage of summer item sale, but I'm not gonna repeat that because Richard's a friend and I think that moving forward but three months or a year after 20 years of see, for me, I have a high standard for everything I do.Uh, and for everything everyone else does and when I see a stock, not just, oh, great earnings report boom because I think, I don't know, I don't follow gap but I think it's, they're happy.I'm sure I spoke to some friends and I congratulate you and ask you one trend I'm very interested to get your take on this.We're talking about this show.Now, you're seeing online retailers mo really get into this just old fashioned brick and mortar game.Like I'm thinking of Wayfair, of course, Warby Parker Figs.It interests me that you see this trend.Do, do you think that's a smart trend or there's risk to that?Well, you know, trends, an interesting word.I've learned not to follow trends because when you follow them, you follow them but you gotta call the end of the trend uh things, you know, it's interesting.I met the two founders a long time ago on their game every time I go into a doctor's office now or wherever a nurse figs, figs, figs and people wear that stuff, not just working in a doctor's office.I think they're really smart and they know much more than I do.Uh I don't know from who would you mention a way, way, fair way, Robbie Parker.I just, it interests me because if you're, I get it, but at the same time, it could be expensive and, and it seems like it could also carry risk like you're moving into a new area.Like, do you know that strategy as well as you know, the online world?Maybe the skills that the retail business has always been very logical for me.You, we all have huge practices being a customer.Some of those stores have too many stores, those business are opening too many stores.Gap.Oh, my God.I'll never forget.I was in an old navy in Arizona.I said to the store manager, I said anything we can do and she says, yeah, we have two stores within 15 minutes each and, you know, something I was so, I, I, it, it annoyed the hell out of me and I blame myself.It kind of sounds like a Starbucks.Yeah.Well, yeah, and, and more is not better.And in stores, I think one at a time, the landlords now and you know, we only have two shops who are opening a third.We get lots of demand for having a, a shop in someone's area.But the landlords, they're my friends.But you know what the rents are and I, I actually appealed to a couple saying, you know, Alex Mill, it's cool.We're getting hot.I always felt that and, and I like our clothes at fairly priced.You don't need a mortgage and it's a taste style that we like.That's what my, what I do.My son started it.So sack came from J crew after 15 years.Gets it.Z Scaler reporting a strong third quarter on the top and bottom lines.Last week, the company also boosted its fiscal year guidance against the backdrop of more cautious guidance from peers in the cybersecurity sector for more.We're now bringing in Z Scaler, Ceo Jay, Choudhry Jay.It is good to have you on the show.And you know, Jay, this is the first time we've had a chance to talk to you since you reported results.Jay, you reported you beat the stock jumped, maybe start that there, Jay walk us through.What drove the quarter.So Cyber is the number one concern for Cio C sos and boats, but they also have to worry about cost savings.Uh Market is tight.There's a lot of deal scrutiny.C skier is a unique provider where we provide the best cyber security with zero trust architecture, but we also reduce cost because we eliminate a bunch of legacy security point products, firewalls, VPN S and more.So that's why we're able to close business uh by doing both at the same time.Hey Jay, it's Julie here.It's good to see you.Um You guys recently reported a cyber breach.I believe.What can you tell us about that?And did that have any kind of effect in the quarter or, or in the present quarter?So there's no breach per se, there's a claim breach, so to speak, the social media can do all kinds of stuff.Yes, we, we did have uh an engineer trying to play with a new server in a Q environment single machine that was out there discovered that was being set up.So there's a lot of basis for it.There's none to it.We're very transparent with customers.We kept in communication but it had no impact.Rather customers came and said, wow, you guys had great transparent communication.We love it, Jay when we have you, it's always worth getting your kind of broader take on the threat landscape.Jay, I mean, a lot of threats, rogue states, bad actors, criminal gangs.What are you seeing out there, Jay?They, the two main areas, one the people who want to make money quick.So ran somewhere on the rise and then there are nation states trying to steal secrets.Those are the two big buckets and they are leveraging by getting on the network of the company moving laterally find high value assets and going after that.So zero trust architecture is being clearly looked at as the primary solution for it.The reason zero Zalar growth is happening is because companies are embracing zero trust architecture that we pioneered.You talked about China just now the big threat from China is that all large companies who are present in China, they have a network coming from China all the way to the US or Europe.Bad guys can get on the network in China, travel and try to infect stuff out there.We allow you not to have a network connected to China or other countries and still have secure communication.Those are the type of things, enterprises and fed government organizations need to do to secure themselves.And Jay of course, um this is an election year, not only in the US, we just had an election in Mexico, we just had an election in India.And I know that when you're talking about breaches or insecure communications, that's a very different issue than misinformation and disinformation.But I'm just curious what you are seeing if anything sort of linked to geopolitics around the globe.So we do track it though.It's not our primary focus.We are seeing uptake of this information.Uh uh We have a research team that actually tries to figure out what content is generated by Gen A I and what what content is created by people.It's fascinating to see, you can actually tell the difference and we're seeing a lot more content that's being put out, put out there that gen A I is creating.So all of us have to need, need to worry about it.Jay, I wanna talk to you on, on competition real quickly and specifically Microsoft uh moving into your world.You know, I I was checking with an analyst Jay who covers uh the company and he was saying, listen that that is in his opinion, creating some noise in the market and on the street.Um What are you seeing, Jay look, large companies like Microsoft, they want to expand in all areas, right?So I'm not surprised that they're trying to expand in our area.They have had overlapping products for a while.Microsoft Windows has VPN built in for a long, long time.But when I talk to large enterprises, they asked for two things.Number one, they said I want a security provider like a Switzerland who can equally support my security to access office 365 Azure, Aws GCP and scores of SAS applications.We are in a better position to do that than an application provider like Microsoft.Number two with all the issue you're seeing out there with midnight blizzard.I'm sure you saw the report that came from federal government about some of those issues.More and more customers want application provider to be different from security provider, separation of applications and security is a better thing.You don't want a Fox was the Henhouse Jay.We always appreciate you coming on the show.Thank you.",

latest market action  click here this post was written by mariela rosales video transcriptwelcome to best of asking for a trend this show recaps and highlights today s trends that will shape tomorrow s market we understand that with so many trends influencing the market and so little time to grasp them all  it can be difficult to digest that s why we dive deep into the trends so you don t have to here are the key trends you should keep an eye out for i m josh lipton and i am here now with punier ceo alex carp for this exclusive yahoo finance interview here at a ip con this is the company s customer conference alex  thanks for taking the time to chat very happy to be here so today there s gonna be more than 250 of your customers and they re gonna be here  alex talking about a ip this is your flagship a i platform let s start there  alex for  for many viewers who aren t as familiar what is a ip  how does it work and how are businesses leveraging it right iii i think what everybody watching this is familiar with is you have a massive he cycle around large language models and then when you try to use them in your enterprise you find out that it s more like self flagellation and it s expensive with no output and what we learned in the context of war fighting primarily but also across the uh 20 years of building uh software infrastructure were how do you manage an emergent natural resource called large language model uh models in a way where you actually get value  meaning you can transform your enterprise  you can change the margins  you can turn tech non technical people into technical people on the battlefield you can do things that would have otherwise cost billions of dollars for millions of dollars meaning being very precise in how you allocate troops  being precise in how you target people um there s a fundamental fallacy around large language models people could conflate uh actual data of an enterprise which is structured and can be taken apart and understood with a large language model which is much more like an emergent property  something that is can be modeled used  but you need precision and all the value in the market is going to go to chips story continuesand what we call ontology  we have this ontology and the ontology will allow you to take a large language model and use it  refine it and then impose it on your enterprise in the logic of enterprise and the security model of your enterprise and what does that mean for the 7070 people are here presenting talking about why they re using it  how they re using it you gotta remember we started uh selling this product just over a year ago uh we started with the claim that we knew a lot about the precursors of large language models and large language models and the general approach of just buying models is going to be essentially self pleasuring for an enterprise at the cost of the enterprise and no one believed us and now you see 70 people saying  hey  we re using this for construction  we re using it for hospitals uh the people who are not speaking  but we re using it on the battlefield we re using it to compress margins we re using it to build enterprises that we re only able to build in asia and america we re making engineers uh better engineers we re making people are not engineers into engineers using our anology and a large language model and this works very  very quickly and it is substantially changing the health and vitality of every business here as opposed to the alternative  which is that you buy some large language model  you  you party with it basically and the next day you have a hangover and  and then  and so like and again  for  for people just looking at this  what does it mean for palant here it means we are sitting on the only thing that actually creates uh a quantifiable transformational value in an enterprise yes  it is not understood well  because everybody understands the problem incorrectly yes  it is going to transform america and our clients are leaving the way and  and by the way  it s like to actually show things that are not understood you have to actually show them the whole purpose of this conference is i can tell you how an ontology works it s actually quite simple you have the logic of the business  you including the security logic of the business and you have something that it approximates new knowledge in a new form called a large language model and it allows you to take the value of the new form  the raw resource of a large language model  largely powered by chips and put it into a precise organization in the logic of the business i can tell you that where i can show you 70 businesses say my business is stronger  healthier and much better than any other business in my sector and so what is the bottom line for investors listing alex how would you characterize what is commercial demand like right now for a ip the way i would explain it to my most important investors  which are individual investors there s two parts of the market that are creating value people will pay for chips and ontology and you understand the chip side now and now you re going to understand and what does that mean for your business it means you can actually use this raw resource and process it into something that actually works and if you want to see exactly how  what the people presenting  you re going to see people in construction  using it to build buildings quicker  cheaper  more accurately  you re going to see people in the hospital industry saying  how could i possibly ever distribute my patients ethically fairly and commercially relevantly  how could i distribute resources across how can i manage my my company as not abstract units but as a portfolio these are  these things are happening within days what i m interested in the alex is because you  you can talk a lot of ceo s will say and they ll sit on your finds  they re interested in a i but actually they re not willing to pull the trigger yet because they have these questions about privacy  security vs but  but you re saying we re crushing it we re closing a i  what i would tell any of them is how are you doing it well  there s a technical answer which i gave you the precursor of  but again  do you wanna know how we re doing it or do you wanna enjoy it being done both great well  first  you  but no  actually  first you wanna see it works like the  the  the  the central issue i think  i mean  we have hundreds and hundreds of ceo s and by the way  the thing about the 70 people here presenting is  you know  they re presenting to other people i m not paying them to present the reason they re presenting is they re like  wow  i didn t really believe this could work and now it s working really well so the most important thing  by the way for a normal user  someone who s gonna pay is does it work then the second question is how does it work does it scale what is the commercial model you really have to establish it works i would stand by the thing that it  in this case is people think of large language models as the value in of itself what they re gonna find is the large language model is much more like a chemistry experiment the outgrowth of which is a something that is useful when refined and the refinement of that for your enterprise happens in what we call our ontology  which is where we impose the logic of your business on large language model in the security and intellectual logic of your business and this is transformative and what it means for investors and others is there is value in this market people  you can identify where the value is very easily are people paying for it will they pay for it and what will there s a prey to optimality to a lot of this stuff and that prey to optimality happens when people say  oh  i am actually getting value and that s why people are here let me ask you  you suggest i wanna broaden the conversation because you kind of suggested this just give your take on the moment we re in because there s some alex you ve heard who say listen  this is a historic moment internet mobile and now a i nvidia jensen wong said the next industrial revolution has begun do you agree with that you agree with jensen um i think you re gonna have very divergent for some people this is the next generation and for others who i think they re doing very similar things it s gonna fail who defines the winners who will be the winners well  come talk to our 70 customers  they think they re winning it s like  you know  you look  it s a lot of this goes back to basic ideas of how you build things why you gotta talk to people who are getting value and ask them  how are you getting value why are you getting value are you paying more or less for that value than you think you should and that s exactly what you re gonna see today you re gonna see people saying i m getting a lot of value it went much quicker than i thought i m  i m outstripping what i thought i could do i m better  much better than the people it happened efficiently and i m probably  i don t think they ll say this  but i m paying less than i think i should and that s why i m very happy about it let me get your t too  when we talk about a i  we got to talk geopolitics i m very curious to get your answer to this question who is in pole position  us or china well  we have a very different problem in the us than any other country in the world we are in pole position  but we obviously have to move much  much quicker um you see on the battlefield and again  uh without mentioning uh where these things are used exactly what i m talking about large language model plus ontology is can be wielded as a very deadly weapon and create enormous efficiencies for uh especially small armies against large armies um we have to be myopically focused in this culture of  we are in a pre war situation with our adversaries and we can no longer afford the theologies about what works on the battlefield we have to go very deep and look at what s happening on battlefields and do a diagnostic of it it s much less critical  but it s the same thing that businesses have to do what is working  what is not  not a theological thing of what would i like to believe is working and what works on the battlefield where our central advantage is uh as the united states of america  the leader of the west and the most important country in the world is technology  venture backed companies and especially software and software driven weapon systems and how  how do you get the software to control the hardware so that we can  we can get out of the business of trying to compete with people who are better at hardware and get into the business of producing something they do not produce as well comes down to execution the problem we have in the west actually is again  is prey to optimality the  the the products that actually scare our enemies are  are just not products that employ mill millions of people they  but they still are deadly they are software driven hardware systems moving to software driven autonomous hardware systems one of the biggest lessons of war and one of the reasons this is so crazy  valuable is the russians and all of our adversaries have now learned the value of electronic warfare by the way again  these things are exactly isomorphic to commercial you have enormous new headwinds  the commercial  your competition has developed something that renders your product strategy irrelevant you have to rebuild it with a new playbook this is exactly what happens on the battlefield you cannot use a normal missile or normal tank on the battlefield anymore because the electric warfare  electronic warfare allows you to suppress the gps signal and that means these things have to be controlled uh with software to go around map where the electronic  where the suppression happens and then in the final mile at some point  autonomously  completely different ways of doing a i completely different news ways of doing it all of which are an advantage to america if we implement just like in american industry  we have something called a chip industry that is the world s leading in this area and or at least the  the  the final product and we have something called software ontology  which actually makes all of this crazy valuable do you implement it do you go talk to people are doing it or do you read the powerpoint written by someone who has no skin in the game and  and  and the answer to that determines whether america in the west  which i view as a superior way of living because it s fairer better meritocratic leads to free speech allows for wealth creation does that culture actually dominate and win and we by the way have to get out of the apologizing for our culture thing it s like we are a better way of living and we have to be willing to fight for it on the economic front with growth that s why this conference is so important we need growth what makes america different than our adversaries right now is not just western system  we have growth where is that growth coming from technology what is that technology it s compute plus ontology basically and that can change the very structure of our culture from manufacturing to weapon systems to how we organize things to our health care distribution can have a completely different way and better way of living let me ask you this  you  you re talking about a i and we re talking about the benefits  the advantage of the use cases i am also interested i was to get your take on when you think about the risks of this technology let me put one forward we have an election coming how concerned are you as an american executive  but also just an american citizen about the very adversaries we re talking about here deploying a i for nefarious purposes rampant to sow confusion and division and there s only one way to fight uh uh uh uh a deadly adversary what is that with a deadly set of weapons so like if you  you know  if you wanna fight our adversaries and by the way  my version of fighting is you re so strong  you re so willing to fight  they don t fight you so it was like  i recently have gotten in trouble for saying i m a peace activist i am a peace activist i m a peace activist because i want enormous growth in america and i want real deadly weapon system you want peace in the world you have a lot of growth in america and you have really deadly weapon systems and you tell your adversaries  you know what i just might use them i m not even going to explain why i ll use them you start acting up  i will use them you don t act up  i through strength  peace through strength and a little bit of unpredictability you know  we are in a world where our adversaries are founders  they have the founder playbook  which is i m gonna  i m gonna be aggressive and win where i can we have a playbook written probably at harvard and yale and stanford institutions which are now symptomatic with not producing  producing structures where they don t see discrimination when it in front of you producing structures that and ideologies that are literally built for the decline of our country we need to get out of the business of we re declining we re apologizing  we re not going to use force we needed and the peace activists are actually us and the pe people who claim to he s activists are actually sowing destruction disorder discrimination it s an exact inversion of what they claim to be and we  and we  but those of us on our side who are pro growth  pro america  pro our economy transfers and pro having the best systems in the world we need to organize  build things and then we also need to have exact understanding of what works  what doesn t and implement it very quickly i i mentioned the election i want to stick with that real quickly does it matter to palent here who wins biden or trump does that impact any potential business you re going to have with the us government look  we ve been in  we ve dealt  we ve been in business for 20 years i have not seen an impact on our business  depending who s president i am interested listen  we talk about these conflicts around the world right now running hot russia  ukraine  israel hamas has that changed how the dod dod thinks about spending out and what they want to spend on uh the dod is changing rapidly  how it s been so  uh well  there s much more of a focus you saw that we won this big maven contract um these things are a natural growth  uh outgrowth of we need to fight better we need to fight quicker we need to fight on the terms where america has superiority of course  we can move quicker of course  the dod wants to move quicker our society wants to move quicker i think unfortunately  we are going to end up moving even quicker because our adversaries are likely to continue their nefarious acts which russia  china  iran  i mean  all three are working together you know  one of the things i i just  i just ii i travel around the world and basically wherever you go  people are like  well  i want you to  i want  i want you to be strong on this one and appease the other people who believe in appeasement  whether it s iran  china  russia  pick your favorite  the one you re sympathetic with they don t understand we have adversaries there working together despite what you problems  you may have some people don t like the war in ukraine some people don t like israel some people want an appeasement strategy with china it doesn t work  they are working together against us and we have to work together against them last question you mentioned  maven  i wanted to get the dod recently disclosed and this is a five year  480 million contract with pal just walk what is that contract what is it what does it mean for your company i never know what we re allowed to say about these very sensitive contracts but i  i ll tell you what it means for the nation this country is focused on using a i to have a structural advantage in how we deploy and understand the battlefield  deploy our assets and understand the battlefield and p here plays a crucial role in that  in that arena we re gonna continue to play a crucial role in that arena and by the way  we re making it possible through our software to allow other software and hardware companies to work off of our platform so this is not just a win for pollinger though it is and i m very proud of it this is a win quite frankly for the tech ecosystem that powers this nation how big is that ecosystem now  which has grown a lot since we first started talking  the  the  the venture capital world has completely flipped when we talked the last time by and large  the tech company co community was adversarial to palant here on this issue of supporting our nation now  i think the tech community is the most  most supportive part of our economy in  in  in protecting our nation and why did that why did that flip  by the way hey  you know  they stopped hating the player or the game  alex carp i know you are very busy today we appreciate your time thank you take care electrical grids across the country are feeling the pressure from the a i boom our next guest says something s got to give for more bring in george generic managing director at canon court genuity thanks so much for being here  george um this is something we ve been talking about a lot  right this huge demand for a i  the huge demand for power that comes along with it but of course  there s also a lot of talk about grid security  sort of around the country and resiliency and whether it s going to be able to keep up with this so where are the sort of the pain points in your view well  thanks for having me on so we wrote a note last week that was inspired by a report from ct which is the electric reliability council of texas it s the organization that operates their electric grid down there uh and like your other guests  probably we ve written a lot about the potential for a id centers to tax the energy grid but we  what we appreciate about the study from ercot is it s one of the few that we ve actually seen that in a granular way  tries to quantify what the impact could look like you know  the study was inspired by a bill in the texas legislature that demanded ercot analyze the impact of things like data centers on grid reliability as a winter storm in 2021 significantly impacted the grid and resulted in deaths and what the study found that was starting in 2028 2029 2030 in both the winter and summer the curve margins which is this buffer that they try to create to make sure that they can handle peak loads would turn negative and that is clearly not something that they want to do so  either they have to add significant energy ener energy generating assets to the grid or the demand for all this a i related hardware that people are buying has the down and like we say in our notes  something s got to give there well  it doesn t seem like the latter thing is gonna happen necessarily  right at least not in the short term are there any plans though in the works i mean  you know  i feel like for years now we ve been talking about r ct  we ve been talking about the grid problems in texas specifically because of heat waves because of other winter storms as well  winter weather so is anything ha is anything giving on that side so there are plans to add significant energy generating assets  whether it s solar  whether it s stuff and with battery technology and even longer term and we re very bullish on the potential for nuclear technology  particularly small modular reactors that help create baseload clean energy across the country and we cover a company called new scale ticker symbol  smr that hopefully over the next several years  we start to win uh some uh some contracts to build out the energy infrastructure in the united states for data centers and  and it seems like regional  this is really a regional issue we talked to another um analyst yesterday who covers the utility industry and she kind of said  well  it depends on where you re talking about maybe in a place like texas  you would have an issue  but there is sort of ample capacity in other places i guess the question is whether data center operators are gonna try to locate in those places that do have more capacity yeah  that  that s a very fair point i mean  in texas that there s a lot of cheap green energy so companies are putting their data centers there  you know  traditional parts in the mid atlantic  you know  we know some places in ohio so yes  it s  it s kind of geography specific but ultimately  you know  if you  the more data centers you add the more evs you add to the grid  it will begin to tax it and i thought this particular study was alarming just because you get to these this potential negative reserve margin scenario that s very  very dangerous for  for their grid and for the country and so  you know  and like i said  you know  there are  we  we followed up that note that we wrote with the uh basically uh calling out some posts yesterday or two days ago from elon musk and someone else who went back and forth on x that basically said these companies are buying so much of this a i related hardware they don t know where to put it  you know  and that s sort of creating an issue there too so it s not just having to put the energy generating assets in the ground it s also finding a where  where to put all this a i related hardware that  that they re buying and so there seems like there s this potential for an air pocket as all these ambitious plans to create  you know a i data centers meet the realities on the ground of building data centers  buying energy generating assets  getting permits  finding labor this is all the real world stuff that might slow down the uh the a i related stuff  right and not to mention  maybe have an effect on our electricity bills as well  potentially  even though it is regulated industry  you know  we ve already seen that kind of an increase so george  as you mentioned  you kind of look at it as well through the prism of who could benefit from all of this  not just like where is it gonna create bottlenecks as you were just discussing  you talked about one idea  one company that might be poised to benefit are there other sort of  you know  grid resiliency operators or alternative power operators that you re looking to here certainly  you know  we cover a company called a maresco uh that basically a clean tech integrator that should benefit  you know uh although they re not quite seeing demand from data centers yet that we re seeing some early signs from that same thing for a company we cover called fluence that hasn t really seen yet that  that data center demand  but they re starting to see the inklings of it and also if you want to buy a generator for your home to make sure that it s uh it s safe from any issues with the grid you buy genack  gnrc  uh they make the generators that basically serve as backup power for residences and for  you know  for some uh commercial industrial applications as well a recent survey from ey reporting that us corporate m and a deal volume will increase by 20  from this year to next and the outlook is  it s only going up from there we ll have the author  we have the author of that survey joining us now  mitch berlin strategy and transactions leader at ey mitch it s good to see you thanks for being here hi  julie  thanks for having me so i feel like the conventional wisdom for a while was the rates would really have to start to move down more meaningfully before we saw an uptick well  in a lot of stuff  right  in housing activity  but certainly m and a was on that list so is that what we need to unlock things or are people sort of chomping at the bit to get deals done anyway here well  it s a little bit of both julie we need  we do need the rates to come down a bit you know  when we started the year  we thought that we d have about six different decreases in the fed borrowing rate now we re expecting about two  but that s offset by the overall confidence in the market corporate profits are high we have ceo confidence at an all time high 99  of the ceo s we surveyed in a recent interview uh in a recent survey said that they plan on doing a deal at some point in fiscal 24 and we re looking at gdp growth about 2 5  which is a little higher than initially predicted so we are expecting the market to come back despite that  despite the fact that we probably won t get  we know we won t get six cuts in interest rate  maybe more about two mitch  what are some of the motivations that you re hearing from in terms of why uh companies are going after deals well  part of it is that  you know  a lot of these corporations have been  let s talk about corporate  then we ll talk about pe corporate has been sitting on the sidelines for about the last year and a half  but they need to transact to transform  to try to transform through organic means  just takes too long the pace of transformation is too fast so they really do need to do some sort of m and a to be able to continue to stay pace and or stay ahead of their overall competition  they re looking to gain market share so you see a lot of deals where they re hiring competitors to gain market share  they re looking for product expansion so particularly if you look at life sciences  they have m and a patents that are coming to exploration  they need to increase their or i m sorry  they have um they have patents that are expiring so they actually need to build our r and d pipeline and so they re looking to increase that through m and a  you have capacity expansion if you look at the oil and gas industry and the  and the consolidation around the basin and then tech is the largest  the largest sector that s doing transactions a year over year and this year is no exception and that has a lot to do with all the emerging a i technology that companies are trying to acquire as  as well as cyber  cyber technology to protect the data that they need to actually drive the a i that they re acquiring mitch i wanna dig more into some of the sectors in a minute but first  i  i also want to dig into the timing  you know  we talked about when rates might be coming down and what effect that could have but the election also  i imagine is something of a factor are we seeing sort of a rush of desire to get deals done at least announced if not closed before the presidential election well  if you look at history in the last two elections  m and a started high the in the first quarter of the election and then it sort of tapers off towards the end of the year it s hard to determine whether that has to do with the election or just the normal m and a cycles where it s a little bit slower in the fourth quarter of the year this year may be different because  because there are clearly different attitudes and m and a between the different parties and so you have a party right now with the doj and ftc  that s putting a lot of scrutiny on deals if that party is out of office and the  and  and the republican party comes in  there is potential for less scrutiny from the doj and ftc what people falsely think is that the  the interest rates are um will be impacted by the election  but the fed is really independent of whatever governing party is in so the  the fed will not increase or reduce or hold rates flat depending on the party  they re independent but i do think there are some emotional reactions around that that are actually imagine that mitch um but at the same time as you referred to  right this doj has been pretty active is that something that um clients that folks you re talking to are taking into account whether they even decide whether they pursue a deal in the first place in other words  has that put a damper on things over the past couple of years well  we  we certainly talk about it with their clients truly but what they re doing  it s not  it s not scaring them away from doing deals  but i think they re more cautious in how they re doing deals and so what we re working with them on is look at the current structure of this deal doesn t work because it s gonna be perceived as you dominating a certain product category or a certain geography how can we restructure that deal so you still get that return on investment  but maybe it s a little bit of a different structure that will satisfy the doj and ftc guidelines so it s not discouraging them it s just there  we re  we re working with our clients to create more scenarios than we have in the past um unless i  i do wanna dig more into energy in particular because there  the deal activity has just been a lot  right because it s not just the number of deals  it s the size of the deals that we have seen of the ones that have been announced um i believe only one of the large ones has closed in the form of exxon um and uh pioneer  there s still a lot are a lot that are pending um do you think that we ve kind of come to the end of that flurry of activity in that industry we have now come to the end i think there s still a lot of big deals in the pipeline i think we ll continue to see what we re gonna continue to see more these  particularly in oil and gas  oil and gas balance sheets are flush with cash um  so it s  it s a lot easier than to do deals because they don t have to go to  uh  the  the syndicated market to actually finance these deals through debt as a matter of fact  if you look at the last 20 if you look at the largest 20 deals in 2024 only three of them  this is across all industries  many of those deals over oil and gas  only three of those deals actually went to the debt markets to fund those deals the rest were funded through cash or stock it was a busy day for the auto sector carmakers reporting monthly sales for may and ford was a standout rising 11  compared to a year ago but if you look at hybrids and evs sales of those vehicles soared 65  from last year joining me now  kevin roberts cargo is director of industry insights and analytics kevin  it is great to have you on the show so listen  i looked at these for numbers  kevin and  and you know  they look solid us auto sales they popped 11  in may from a year earlier but you are the pro kevin so walk us through it give give me your reaction to this report yeah so we re seeing new inventory continue to grow and that s really helping to improve new vehicle sales and you re seeing that with the top line numbers  uh obviously the hybrid and ev numbers are coming from an overall kind of smaller base compared to internal combustion engines  but definitely seeing positive growth there and i think the really interesting trend is that  you know  for so many years  it was all the focus was on evs and now i think hybrids are really starting to get their chance to shine uh in this spotlight and really look like they might be kind of the goldilocks kind of opportunity for consumers out there as we transition away from  you know  fossil fuels to electric vehicles now  that s interesting  kevin  because hybrids are hot and  and you kind of characterize there as goldilocks why are they popular  kevin and how is ford kind of um capitalizing on that trend yeah  so hybrids tend to be at a price point that s somewhat in between uh evs and internal combustion engines so affordability is always a key fact for consumers when they re looking at vehicles so the affordability is there and then you deal with the fact that uh ranging and kind of concerns about the overall usability of evs and charging and our charging infrastructure and all that really kind of kind of holds back some of that kind of ev adoption where with hybrids  particularly hub plug in hybrids  you can get kind of the best of all worlds where you get the kind of uh reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and some of the utility that you get with evs but then you still have that internal combustion engine uh around for longer road trips and the like that can really be beneficial for consumers and let s talk about evs too kevin  you mentioned it there what is ford s sort of tactic and strategy with that market it doesn t seem like it s a volume game is it a cost gunning game what s the move for them  kevin so what we ve been seeing ford do is we look at the  you know  which models are seeing the largest kind of price declines and particularly with the ford f 150 lightning and the mustang mach e  we ve been seeing some pretty significant price declines on those new ev models and i think what you re seeing is as that price kind of gets reduced  consumers are showing much more kind of interest on that front we ve seen that a lot with used dvs  in particular  the prices for udvs have dropped quite significantly and as the prices really start to slow down for evs adoption and interest really starts to pick up in line with that and kevin  i just want to get your thoughts on e the ev market in general not seeing the growth kevin that we used to what do you see ahead what jumpstarts this market yeah  i  i think we re kind of in a kind of res resettlement period right now with evs where we had a lot of the early adopters who were very enthused to get into evs now we re starting to get into that more kind of mainstream adoption i think it s a couple things  uh  range is less of an issue than i think what people think it really comes down to charging the charging infrastructure needs to get much more in place for consumers to adopt a little bit more and the cost needs to come down  there still is a pretty significant cost premium for evs and once we get down to relative cost parity between evs and internal combustion engines vehicles  i think we ll see a much more uh faster adoption rate but until we get that charging infrastructure in place and the cost in line  i think it s gonna be a little bit more of a difficult challenge and that s where hybrids can really come in and help the auto manufacturers out kevin  i wanna get you out of here on this listen  we talked evs  we talked hybrids  give me your take on  on pickups beyond for just industry wide  kevin  as you look at that category  how healthy  how resilient yeah  i mean  it s  it s definitely still really healthy from a sales volume point of view  but we are seeing as those inventory numbers i mentioned continue to grow we re seeing much more pickups get into the marketplace and so it would be really interesting to see if automakers are able to balance that kind of demand and production without having to uh increase incentives too much to kind of move those vehicles that are sitting on lots the results are in from major retailers signs point to consumers on the hunt for savings as discretionary income is pinched here by prolonged inflation and we know higher interest rates too meanwhile  retail earnings from names such as abercrombie and fitch delivering a shining quarter despite a tough consumer  we re spending backdrop for more on how to read the current state of retail we have the perfect guest mickey drexler  alex mill chairman and former ceo of gap mickey great to see you i say perfect guest mickey because we were talking off camera you ve got earnings season largely behind you a lot of retail names and  and  and you  you got a lot of reports and conference calls ceo s cfo s is an investor trying to get a sense of where this sector is at and we were talking  i said generally my gut was it seems decent  but you re the guru well  i i m not the guru because i make a lot of mistakes between  ok so um i do my service before i appear to talk about the industry uh and i called them a bunch of people and this counters  designers and all that i think it s selectively good i don t think it s all or nothing i think quarterly reports i ve learned this after running gap and j crew public companies for years  quarter to quarter and i asked about color i looked  i wanted to get some color on the discounting today and inflation is crazy when you do these surveys this is nicky drexler you re going into the stores no well  i go online is it a online tells you how much goods are on sale  how  what percentage is off and all that but i ve been saying  first of all  inflation to me is kind of a nightmare still travel uh your point is in that it s increasing at a slower rate  but of course  it s still increase on top of 40 year highs you know  the government doesn t have people going to the supermarkets going to fashion stores and shopping you actually need food and gas  you re saying no yeah but  but how did they know it s slowing in apparel uh i hear mostly complain well  i hear complaints about everything  designer prices uh it s stunning to a lot of people  even those who can afford it because the rate of increased prices is hugely high and there s no  uh doesn t seem to be a letting down i told that the designer business  whatever it means is kind of slowing down but uh if you look at quarter to quarter  pick  pick your spots and i m  i m a merchandise product that s what i look at long term and is that a concept that s gonna work that s the unexpected that sees around corners uh  and i don t hear a lot of  or see a lot of that designers  in my opinion  it used to be when i was a young guy  you know  you go to get gucci buckle shoes and it was like a kind of a deal and today  i don t know where i m not  i m not for the manor born  but i don t know where people don t buy designer clothes at what level and the weights for the be and it s mostly accessories from what i know and accessories are kind of like carrying around a little logo or maybe a bigger logo but um i think uh i  i think you buy goods  you buy the styles  you buy the products  you buy service and as i warned in a  i forgot where i was quoted i said if i were a consumer today buying a para  i would actually  before i gave them the credit card  i go online and see where i could get it at a better price almost like a commodity in a way i know that sounds weird but there s so many different price uh issues and a lot of companies now have an online deal and if you re a customer  you slept to the store  you don t know about the online deal unless you know about it  then they ll honor that so  retail  not an easy one i m not a  a good investor really because uh but i m impressed well  not a lot of people i always mention tj maxx because carol s a great merchant and you know  you go and that s the real price let me ask you  you mentioned tj max i would love to get your take on gap as well because they report mickey  they knock it out of the park stock is a monster over the last 12 months what are your thoughts on that name well  uh  good for them all right uh but three months if you ve been in the stock  right well  i  i used to be in the stock but that was a long time ago uh i  i think that obviously perceived to be doing a good job uh i don t pay much attention um  i did include a gap in my percentage of summer item sale  but i m not gonna repeat that because richard s a friend and i think that moving forward but three months or a year after 20 years of see  for me  i have a high standard for everything i do uh  and for everything everyone else does and when i see a stock  not just  oh  great earnings report boom because i think  i don t know  i don t follow gap but i think it s  they re happy i m sure i spoke to some friends and i congratulate you and ask you one trend i m very interested to get your take on this we re talking about this show now  you re seeing online retailers mo really get into this just old fashioned brick and mortar game like i m thinking of wayfair  of course  warby parker figs it interests me that you see this trend do  do you think that s a smart trend or there s risk to that well  you know  trends  an interesting word i ve learned not to follow trends because when you follow them  you follow them but you gotta call the end of the trend uh things  you know  it s interesting i met the two founders a long time ago on their game every time i go into a doctor s office now or wherever a nurse figs  figs  figs and people wear that stuff  not just working in a doctor s office i think they re really smart and they know much more than i do uh i don t know from who would you mention a way  way  fair way  robbie parker i just  it interests me because if you re  i get it  but at the same time  it could be expensive and  and it seems like it could also carry risk like you re moving into a new area like  do you know that strategy as well as you know  the online world maybe the skills that the retail business has always been very logical for me you  we all have huge practices being a customer some of those stores have too many stores  those business are opening too many stores gap oh  my god i ll never forget i was in an old navy in arizona i said to the store manager  i said anything we can do and she says  yeah  we have two stores within 15 minutes each and  you know  something i was so  i  i  it  it annoyed the hell out of me and i blame myself it kind of sounds like a starbucks yeah well  yeah  and  and more is not better and in stores  i think one at a time  the landlords now and you know  we only have two shops who are opening a third we get lots of demand for having a  a shop in someone s area but the landlords  they re my friends but you know what the rents are and i  i actually appealed to a couple saying  you know  alex mill  it s cool we re getting hot i always felt that and  and i like our clothes at fairly priced you don t need a mortgage and it s a taste style that we like that s what my  what i do my son started it so sack came from j crew after 15 years gets it z scaler reporting a strong third quarter on the top and bottom lines last week  the company also boosted its fiscal year guidance against the backdrop of more cautious guidance from peers in the cybersecurity sector for more we re now bringing in z scaler  ceo jay  choudhry jay it is good to have you on the show and you know  jay  this is the first time we ve had a chance to talk to you since you reported results jay  you reported you beat the stock jumped  maybe start that there  jay walk us through what drove the quarter so cyber is the number one concern for cio c sos and boats  but they also have to worry about cost savings uh market is tight there s a lot of deal scrutiny c skier is a unique provider where we provide the best cyber security with zero trust architecture  but we also reduce cost because we eliminate a bunch of legacy security point products  firewalls  vpn s and more so that s why we re able to close business uh by doing both at the same time hey jay  it s julie here it s good to see you um you guys recently reported a cyber breach i believe what can you tell us about that and did that have any kind of effect in the quarter or  or in the present quarter so there s no breach per se  there s a claim breach  so to speak  the social media can do all kinds of stuff yes  we  we did have uh an engineer trying to play with a new server in a q environment single machine that was out there discovered that was being set up so there s a lot of basis for it there s none to it we re very transparent with customers we kept in communication but it had no impact rather customers came and said  wow  you guys had great transparent communication we love it  jay when we have you  it s always worth getting your kind of broader take on the threat landscape jay  i mean  a lot of threats  rogue states  bad actors  criminal gangs what are you seeing out there  jay they  the two main areas  one the people who want to make money quick so ran somewhere on the rise and then there are nation states trying to steal secrets those are the two big buckets and they are leveraging by getting on the network of the company moving laterally find high value assets and going after that so zero trust architecture is being clearly looked at as the primary solution for it the reason zero zalar growth is happening is because companies are embracing zero trust architecture that we pioneered you talked about china just now the big threat from china is that all large companies who are present in china  they have a network coming from china all the way to the us or europe bad guys can get on the network in china  travel and try to infect stuff out there we allow you not to have a network connected to china or other countries and still have secure communication those are the type of things  enterprises and fed government organizations need to do to secure themselves and jay of course  um this is an election year  not only in the us  we just had an election in mexico  we just had an election in india and i know that when you re talking about breaches or insecure communications  that s a very different issue than misinformation and disinformation but i m just curious what you are seeing if anything sort of linked to geopolitics around the globe so we do track it though it s not our primary focus we are seeing uptake of this information uh uh we have a research team that actually tries to figure out what content is generated by gen a i and what what content is created by people it s fascinating to see  you can actually tell the difference and we re seeing a lot more content that s being put out  put out there that gen a i is creating so all of us have to need  need to worry about it jay  i wanna talk to you on  on competition real quickly and specifically microsoft uh moving into your world you know  i i was checking with an analyst jay who covers uh the company and he was saying  listen that that is in his opinion  creating some noise in the market and on the street um what are you seeing  jay look  large companies like microsoft  they want to expand in all areas  right so i m not surprised that they re trying to expand in our area they have had overlapping products for a while microsoft windows has vpn built in for a long  long time but when i talk to large enterprises  they asked for two things number one  they said i want a security provider like a switzerland who can equally support my security to access office 365 azure  aws gcp and scores of sas applications we are in a better position to do that than an application provider like microsoft number two with all the issue you re seeing out there with midnight blizzard i m sure you saw the report that came from federal government about some of those issues more and more customers want application provider to be different from security provider  separation of applications and security is a better thing you don t want a fox was the henhouse jay we always appreciate you coming on the show thank you ',

                        "There's no question about it. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been the hottest stock of the generative artificial intelligence (AI) era.The graphics processing unit (GPU) and AI hardware specialist has added more than $2 trillion to its market capitalization since ChatGPT was launched, well ahead of any other stock, and its shares are up by roughly 700% since the start of 2023.While some billionaires caught on to that trend early, buying Nvidia shares as the disruptive potential of generative AI became clear, now it seems that many of those investors are beginning to think its surge has run out of steam. According to hedge-fund tracker WhaleWisdom, more top investors cut their stakes in Nvidia than added to them in the first quarter: 207 hedge funds increased their holdings of Nvidia in Q1, down from 269 in the fourth quarter. Meanwhile, 336 hedge funds reduced their holdings in the chip giant, roughly 60% more than the number of hedge funds that added to their positions.Among the billionaires selling Nvidia stock were Ken Griffin of Citadel, Israel Englander of Millennium Management, and Paul Tudor Jones of Tudor Investment Group.That pattern seems to be a sign that there's fatigue surrounding the stock, and these hedge fund managers are taking the opportunity to lock in their profits.Image source: Getty Images.Reasons to sellHedge fund managers' 13F filings don't come with commentary, but investors can make a few educated guesses as to why these Wall Street luminaries are selling this stock.Taking some profits off the table seems like the most obvious reason, especially considering recent chatter that capital gains tax rates on the wealthy could be increased. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett said that was one of the reasons his company sold shares of Apple in the first quarter.Another reason is that greater competition is on the way. Advanced Micro Devices and Intel have both launched competing data center GPUs, and tech companies such as Meta Platforms and Microsoft are also developing their own AI-capable chips in-house to reduce their dependence on Nvidia.One billionaire investor, Stanley Druckenmiller, explained his decision to start unwinding his stake in Nvidia, saying that much of what his firm had recognized earlier in the stock has now been recognized by the broader market. Indeed, Nvidia's dominance of the AI chip sector and its skyrocketing growth have become clear.What billionaire investors are buying insteadThe hedge fund managers that are selling Nvidia stock are buying a wide range of companies in its place, but you might be surprised to learn that one of the choices to replace Nvidia has been Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F).Story continuesCitadel, Millennium Management, and Tudor Investment Group were all among the hedge funds that bought Ford last quarter. Citadel added 5.45 million shares and Millennium Management added 7.34 million shares. Tudor added 1.76 million shares, but that made Ford one of its biggest buys in the quarter.Ford was also more favored than not among hedge funds: 116 funds added to their stakes in the automaker while only 92 sold its shares.Ford has struggled in recent times, but it could be sitting at the intersection of a number of favorable trends. First, pure-play electric vehicle (EV) makers are struggling as demand growth for EVs is slowing, and valuations in that sector are coming down. That has made traditional auto stocks more popular, and while Ford's EV business hasn't yet turned a profit, the company is finding success with hybrids.Ford should also benefit from the expected decline in interest rates later this year, which will make cars more affordable. Finally, the company has growth potential in areas like EVs, hybrids, and autonomy, and the stock is cheap, trading at a forward P/E of 6.Still, Ford has a low valuation for a reason. Investors assume it will be disrupted by fast-growing rivals like Tesla.However, for investors looking to rotate out of a growth stock like Nvidia and into a cyclical dividend stock with upside potential, Ford looks like a good choice, especially given its dividend yield of 5% at the current share price.Should you invest $1,000 in Ford Motor Company right now?Before you buy stock in Ford Motor Company, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Ford Motor Company wasn’t one of them.

                        "Some investors might not want to pick individual stocks for all or even some of their portfolios. This is where something like an exchange-traded fund (ETF) comes into the picture.While an ETF that tracks the S&P 500 might get a lot of the attention because it is a top benchmark for assessing how the stock market is doing, there's another ETF that investors need to consider that could potentially lead to stronger long-term returns. I'm talking about the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ: QQQ).Here are four reasons why you should buy this ETF like there's no tomorrow.Portfolio compositionThe Invesco QQQ Trust is unique in that it tracks the performance of the Nasdaq-100 index. This includes the top 100 non-financial companies that trade on the Nasdaq exchange.It's worth discussing the ETF's composition. It's heavily weighted in two sectors. Technology has a heavy presence, representing 59% of the fund's assets, while consumer discretionary accounts for 18%. These areas of the market have typically been where many winners come from.Investors are certainly familiar with some of the Invesco QQQ Trust's top positions. The so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" combined make up a notable 42% of assets. They are some of the most dominant enterprises on planet Earth. And they have proven their ability to disrupt various industries. The Invesco QQQ Trust also has 23% of the portfolio invested in sectors besides tech and consumer discretionary. This at least provides some level of industry diversification.Impressive track recordIf you'd invested $10,000 in the Invesco QQQ Trust 10 years ago, you would have $54,600 today. That translates into a superb 18.5% annualized return when including dividends. It's hard to argue with this track record.The Invesco QQQ Trust's gain outpaces the 232% and 341% returns that the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite index, respectively, have been able to achieve since June 2014. Again, it goes back to the broad exposure that this ETF has to the tech and consumer discretionary sectors.Investors shouldn't blindly assume that this top-notch performance is going to continue. But while past results don't guarantee future returns, the companies that dominate the Invesco QQQ Trust generally have wide economic moats, solid growth prospects, and a focus on being leaders in the artificial intelligence race.Don't forget about feesSome professionals in the investment industry are known for charging exorbitant fees for managing others' capital. For example, typical active fund managers charge annual fees that are based on a percentage of assets that are managed. And hedge funds cost even more. Over a long period of time, these fees can seriously eat away at an investor's return, so it's important to be mindful of them.Story continuesLuckily, the Invesco QQQ Trust has an expense ratio of just 0.20%. This means that for every $10,000 that's invested in the ETF, you only pay $20 in annual fees. That's a very compelling proposition, particularly when you remember its impressive historical track record.Low maintenanceInvestors rightfully focus on the most obvious factors when looking at an ETF, like the previously mentioned composition, track record, and fees. However, there's an overlooked aspect that deserves some attention.If you're someone who isn't planning to retire for at least the next 10 years, then you can adopt a strategy of dollar-cost averaging into the Invesco QQQ Trust every month or quarter. This requires almost no effort on your part. It makes investing in the Invesco QQQ Trust a very low-maintenance way to build wealth. And that leaves lots of time to focus on the things that are most important to you.Should you invest $1,000 in Invesco QQQ Trust right now?Before you buy stock in Invesco QQQ Trust, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Invesco QQQ Trust wasn’t one of them.

                        'The stock market continues to thrive this year, with the S&P 500 up almost 13% and the NASDAQ flying high with a 16% surge. Just like last year, the mega-cap tech stocks have been leading the gains, and providing a positive impetus for the markets as a whole.But the tech giants are not the whole story. Investors are finding good news in several other areas, including the outlook for the Federal Reserve’s interest rate policy. Inflation remains stubborn, but the general outlook is that the Fed will provide overall economic support with rate cuts later this year.The investment bank UBS takes these points – the strong tech performance and the Fed outlook – and builds an overall positive stance, forecasting solid market growth.“We continue to see the current environment as supportive for US equities, driven by solid earnings growth, a potential Fed pivot later this year, and accelerating AI investment,” UBS’ chief investment office says. “Overall, we maintain our 9% earnings growth forecast for the S&P 500 this year… We maintain the view that US rate cuts are likely just pushed back, not canceled. We see two 25-basis-point cuts this year, most likely starting in September.”Against this backdrop, UBS stock analyst Roger Boyd has come down strong for buying two tech stocks ‘on the dip.’ That is, while their share prices are down. These stocks are down but not out, and as Boyd notes, they’re worth investor interest. We’ve used the TipRanks platform to look up the broader view of each, and found that they boast Buy ratings and solid upside potentials from the rest of the Street. Here are the details.SentinelOne (S)First up is SentinelOne, a cybersecurity firm dedicated to protecting the essential digital infrastructure that today’s networked systems depend on. SentinelOne offers enterprise customers a security platform that is optimized for business needs – and that puts all digital security functions into one interface. It’s a single cybersecurity platform that consolidates products and business functions to maximize value. The company estimates that its customers realize 66% reduction in security -related costs, while gaining a 90% increase in efficiency.SentinelOne’s platform allows users to protect endpoints, securely managing assets while preventing attackers from gaining entry; to secure cloud operations, a natural weak point in cybersecurity; and to fortify identities, to reduce risk on active directories, to detect and stop misuse of credentials, and to prevent unauthorized lateral movements. Together, these features add up to solid digital protection, for business PCs, mobile devices, IoT – in short, for any set of devices that can be connected to a network, and can originate, send, or receive information.Story continuesNo cybersecurity firm can be comprehensive unless it stays at the cutting edge of today’s tech – and that means making effective use of AI. SentinelOne offers its proprietary Purple AI, an AI-powered security analysis software designed to bring earlier detection and faster response to the table, so that users can stay ahead of any potential attacker. According to the company, early adopters of Purple AI reported 80% faster threat detection.All of this adds up to a solid online security firm. Nevertheless, shares in S have been taking a beating this year (down by 37% year-to-date) with a big leg down taking place after the company’s fiscal 1Q25 report disappointed on forward guidance.So what did the Q1 report say? The immediate quarterly financial results came in ahead of expectations. Revenue, at $186.4 million, was up over 39.7% year-over-year and beat the forecast by $5.3 million. The bottom line figure – the non-GAAP EPS – came in a flat zero, breaking even – but that was 5 cents per share better than had been expected. Annualized recurring revenue, ARR, as of April 30 this year, was up 35% year-over-year to $762 million, and the company reported a 30% increase in customers with ARR of $100,000 or more.But – the company cut back on its fiscal 2025 revenue guidance, trimming from a range of $812 million-$818 million back to the range of $808 million-$815 million. The new guidance compares unfavorably to the consensus expectation for the company’s fiscal year 2025, which predicted revenue of $817.28 million.Turning to the UBS view, and analyst Roger Boyd, we find that he is upbeat on S, despite the lowered guidance. Instead of drawing back, Boyd would use the lower stock price to buy in, and writes, “Even with CY24 ARR estimates coming down 2%, S remains one of the cheapest stocks on a growth-adjusted basis at ~0.20x EV/S/G on both CY24 and CY25 estimates. While the company appears limited by the push towards profitability (single-digit opex growth), it remains a technology leader and a strategic asset, in our view. In particular, the company appears to have momentum around its Purple AI offering, which drew a significant amount of attention at RSA, and early customer feedback appears to support the claims around automation.”Boyd goes on to rate S shares as a Buy, with a $27 price target implying a one-year upside potential of 57%. (To watch Boyd’s track record, click here)From Wall Street generally, this cybersecurity firm gets a Moderate Buy rating, based on 21 recent recommendations that include 14 to Buy and 8 to Hold. The shares are priced at $17.18 and their $26 average price target suggests a gain of 51% on the one-year time frame. (See SentinelOne’s stock forecast)Zscaler (ZS)The second UBS pick we’ll look at is Zscaler. This company calls its cloud-native network security platform the ‘Zero Trust Exchange,’ a name that sums up its approach to cybersecurity: no trust without verification. The platform provides any-to-any security for cloud networks, designed, in the company’s words, to ‘securely connect individual users, devices, and applications.’ Zscaler exchange can connect any device or app, from any location, to both internal and external apps, while providing solid protection, at any scale, for the user’s system and networks.Some numbers will show the size of the job, and underscore the magnitude of Zscaler’s success in the industry. The company monitors 400-plus billion daily online transactions, and prevents over 9 billion daily security incidents and/or policy violations. The platform also monitors over 500 trillion daily signals for AI and machine learning effect, in short, teaching itself how to more effectively monitor the online and cloud security environment. The company boasts over 7,500 customers, including a large portion of companies on the Forbes Global 2000 list.While cybersecurity is in high demand, Zscaler’s shares have seen a decline in 2024, falling by 29% from the peak reached earlier in the year. That said, the stock has been gaining recently following the May 30 release of the fiscal 3Q24 results.Those results were solid. Zscaler’s revenue for the quarter came to $553.2 million, for a 32% year-over-year increase – and beating the forecast by over $17 million. Non-GAAP EPS hit 88 cents per share, a full 23 cents ahead of expectations. Another metric, that bodes well going forward, was the deferred revenue, or the backlog; this was reported as $1.577 billion as of April 30 this year, a figure that was up 34% from the prior year. Calculated billings in fiscal Q3 were up 30% year-over-year, to $628 million. Finally, Zscaler finished the quarter with deep pockets, reporting $2.24 billion in cash and other liquid assets.Scanning the results, while aware where some issues will arise moving forward, UBS analyst Boyd takes a positive stance, writing, “ZS reported strong F3Q results that were ahead of expectations, delivering billings growth of 30% and other profitability metrics meaningfully above expectations. The initial FY25 outlook for roughly 20-21% billings growth should ease investor concerns on the topline; however, the debate from here will likely center around margin upside following a FY25 profitability outlook that on the margin appears a bit light. That said, results were much better than feared, and with the impressive topline performance and improving GTM execution commentary against a still-tough macro, we’re incrementally more positive after the print.”Boyd takes his ‘incrementally more positive’ view and uses it to back a Buy rating here, while his $270 price target shows that he is confident in a 49% upside in the next 12 months.The UBS view here is more upbeat than the overall Street take – which is already decent enough. ZS stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating, based on 30 recent reviews including 23 to Buy against 7 to Hold. The shares are priced at $180.99 and have an average target price of $228.57, implying a 26% one-year upside potential.

                        'the stock market continues to thrive this year  with the s p 500 up almost 13  and the nasdaq flying high with a 16  surge  just like last year  the mega cap tech stocks have been leading the gains  and providing a positive impetus for the markets as a whole but the tech giants are not the whole story  investors are finding good news in several other areas  including the outlook for the federal reserve s interest rate policy  inflation remains stubborn  but the general outlook is that the fed will provide overall economic support with rate cuts later this year the investment bank ubs takes these points   the strong tech performance and the fed outlook   and builds an overall positive stance  forecasting solid market growth  we continue to see the current environment as supportive for us equities  driven by solid earnings growth  a potential fed pivot later this year  and accelerating ai investment   ubs  chief investment office says   overall  we maintain our 9  earnings growth forecast for the s p 500 this year  we maintain the view that us rate cuts are likely just pushed back  not canceled  we see two 25 basis point cuts this year  most likely starting in september  against this backdrop  ubs stock analyst roger boyd has come down strong for buying two tech stocks  on the dip   that is  while their share prices are down  these stocks are down but not out  and as boyd notes  they re worth investor interest  we ve used the tipranks platform to look up the broader view of each  and found that they boast buy ratings and solid upside potentials from the rest of the street  here are the details sentinelone  s first up is sentinelone  a cybersecurity firm dedicated to protecting the essential digital infrastructure that today s networked systems depend on  sentinelone offers enterprise customers a security platform that is optimized for business needs   and that puts all digital security functions into one interface  it s a single cybersecurity platform that consolidates products and business functions to maximize value  the company estimates that its customers realize 66  reduction in security  related costs  while gaining a 90  increase in efficiency sentinelone s platform allows users to protect endpoints  securely managing assets while preventing attackers from gaining entry  to secure cloud operations  a natural weak point in cybersecurity  and to fortify identities  to reduce risk on active directories  to detect and stop misuse of credentials  and to prevent unauthorized lateral movements  together  these features add up to solid digital protection  for business pcs  mobile devices  iot   in short  for any set of devices that can be connected to a network  and can originate  send  or receive information story continuesno cybersecurity firm can be comprehensive unless it stays at the cutting edge of today s tech   and that means making effective use of ai  sentinelone offers its proprietary purple ai  an ai powered security analysis software designed to bring earlier detection and faster response to the table  so that users can stay ahead of any potential attacker  according to the company  early adopters of purple ai reported 80  faster threat detection all of this adds up to a solid online security firm  nevertheless  shares in s have been taking a beating this year  down by 37  year to date  with a big leg down taking place after the company s fiscal 1q25 report disappointed on forward guidance so what did the q1 report say  the immediate quarterly financial results came in ahead of expectations  revenue  at  186 4 million  was up over 39 7  year over year and beat the forecast by  5 3 million  the bottom line figure   the non gaap eps   came in a flat zero  breaking even   but that was 5 cents per share better than had been expected  annualized recurring revenue  arr  as of april 30 this year  was up 35  year over year to  762 million  and the company reported a 30  increase in customers with arr of  100 000 or more but   the company cut back on its fiscal 2025 revenue guidance  trimming from a range of  812 million  818 million back to the range of  808 million  815 million  the new guidance compares unfavorably to the consensus expectation for the company s fiscal year 2025  which predicted revenue of  817 28 million turning to the ubs view  and analyst roger boyd  we find that he is upbeat on s  despite the lowered guidance  instead of drawing back  boyd would use the lower stock price to buy in  and writes   even with cy24 arr estimates coming down 2   s remains one of the cheapest stocks on a growth adjusted basis at  0 20x ev s g on both cy24 and cy25 estimates  while the company appears limited by the push towards profitability  single digit opex growth   it remains a technology leader and a strategic asset  in our view  in particular  the company appears to have momentum around its purple ai offering  which drew a significant amount of attention at rsa  and early customer feedback appears to support the claims around automation  boyd goes on to rate s shares as a buy  with a  27 price target implying a one year upside potential of 57    to watch boyd s track record  click here from wall street generally  this cybersecurity firm gets a moderate buy rating  based on 21 recent recommendations that include 14 to buy and 8 to hold  the shares are priced at  17 18 and their  26 average price target suggests a gain of 51  on the one year time frame   see sentinelone s stock forecast zscaler  zs the second ubs pick we ll look at is zscaler  this company calls its cloud native network security platform the  zero trust exchange   a name that sums up its approach to cybersecurity  no trust without verification  the platform provides any to any security for cloud networks  designed  in the company s words  to  securely connect individual users  devices  and applications   zscaler exchange can connect any device or app  from any location  to both internal and external apps  while providing solid protection  at any scale  for the user s system and networks some numbers will show the size of the job  and underscore the magnitude of zscaler s success in the industry  the company monitors 400 plus billion daily online transactions  and prevents over 9 billion daily security incidents and or policy violations  the platform also monitors over 500 trillion daily signals for ai and machine learning effect  in short  teaching itself how to more effectively monitor the online and cloud security environment  the company boasts over 7 500 customers  including a large portion of companies on the forbes global 2000 list while cybersecurity is in high demand  zscaler s shares have seen a decline in 2024  falling by 29  from the peak reached earlier in the year  that said  the stock has been gaining recently following the may 30 release of the fiscal 3q24 results those results were solid  zscaler s revenue for the quarter came to  553 2 million  for a 32  year over year increase   and beating the forecast by over  17 million  non gaap eps hit 88 cents per share  a full 23 cents ahead of expectations  another metric  that bodes well going forward  was the deferred revenue  or the backlog  this was reported as  1 577 billion as of april 30 this year  a figure that was up 34  from the prior year  calculated billings in fiscal q3 were up 30  year over year  to  628 million  finally  zscaler finished the quarter with deep pockets  reporting  2 24 billion in cash and other liquid assets scanning the results  while aware where some issues will arise moving forward  ubs analyst boyd takes a positive stance  writing   zs reported strong f3q results that were ahead of expectations  delivering billings growth of 30  and other profitability metrics meaningfully above expectations  the initial fy25 outlook for roughly 20 21  billings growth should ease investor concerns on the topline  however  the debate from here will likely center around margin upside following a fy25 profitability outlook that on the margin appears a bit light  that said  results were much better than feared  and with the impressive topline performance and improving gtm execution commentary against a still tough macro  we re incrementally more positive after the print  boyd takes his  incrementally more positive  view and uses it to back a buy rating here  while his  270 price target shows that he is confident in a 49  upside in the next 12 months the ubs view here is more upbeat than the overall street take   which is already decent enough  zs stock has a strong buy consensus rating  based on 30 recent reviews including 23 to buy against 7 to hold  the shares are priced at  180 99 and have an average target price of  228 57  implying a 26  one year upside potential   see zs stock forecast to find good ideas for stocks trading at attractive valuations  visit

                        "Investing for the future can be difficult, as unexpected expenses always seem to come up. One way to try to encourage yourself to invest is by not aiming for massive savings goals. Instead, slowly putting aside money on a weekly basis can be much more achievable, and still allow you to build up your portfolio's balance over the long haul.And if you can do that, you could be on the path to creating a tremendous portfolio by the time you retire. Below, I'll show you how saving and investing $50 per week can ultimately transform into $35,000 or more in annual dividend income by the time you retire.How saving $50 per week can result in a portfolio worth around $800,000If you invest $50 per week, that's the equivalent of $200 per month, or approximately $2,400 per year. Over a 30-year period, that would result in more than $72,000 in savings. It's a good chunk of savings, but it isn't a life-changing amount. This is where the power of compounding comes into play. If instead of putting that $50 into your bank every week, you invested it into an exchange-traded fund (ETF), you could accelerate your portfolio's growth significantly. Suppose, for example, that you invest that money in a fund such as the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ: QQQ). That fund tracks the top 100 non-financial stocks on the Nasdaq, and it can help give you exposure to some of the best growth stocks in the world, including Microsoft, Nvidia, Apple, and many others. Over the past 20 years, the fund has generated total returns (including dividends) of 1,3950%. That averages out to a compounded annual growth rate of 14.4%. For the sake of being conservative, let's assume that the growth rate you might average from that fund moving forward might be closer to around 12%.Assuming you were to invest $50 per week into the fund, this is how your portfolio balance could climb over a 30-year period.YearBalance5$17,826.3410$50,285.5915$109,389.3520$217,009.0025$412,969.2730$769,785.45Calculations by author. By year 30, your portfolio could be worth around $770,000. The actual growth rate you average over that period will ultimately determine how high the balance will be. But it would be a much larger nest egg than simply saving that $50 per week and tucking it away into a bank account.Turning that savings into a stream of recurring dividend incomeOnce you have that nest egg built up, you can put it to work accumulating dividend income for you. An example of a dividend-focused fund you could invest in today is the Vanguard International High Dividend Yield Index Fund, which yields around 4.9%. At that high of a rate, you could generate more than $37,000 in annual dividends per year.Story continuesYou don't have to aim that high, however. As long as you can obtain a yield of around 4.6%, that would be enough to generate $35,000 in dividend income based on a portfolio balance of $770,000. And if you can get your portfolio even higher than that, then you would need even less of a yield to achieve that level of dividend income.Saving and investing is a powerful combinationYou may not have thousands of dollars saved up today, but any amount you can save and put into an ETF can help pave the way for a better future in the long run.In the above example, I used $50 per week, but if you can save and invest more, that can help accelerate your portfolio's growth, which is why the number of investing years you have left may not be of utmost importance; you can make up for having fewer years remaining until retirement by saving and allocating more money to your portfolio.Should you invest $1,000 in Invesco QQQ Trust right now?Before you buy stock in Invesco QQQ Trust, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Invesco QQQ Trust wasn’t one of them.

                        "Investors had a lot of earnings to digest over the last several days, including reports from CrowdStrike (CRWD), Bath & Body Works (BBWI), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), Dollar Tree (DLTR), Campbell Soup (CPB), Lululemon (LULU), and Zscaler (ZS), to name a few.Yahoo Finance breaks down the earnings results and how companies' stocks reacted to the reports.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here.This post was written by Mariela Rosales.Video TranscriptEarnings season is in full swing, with major companies in banking, tech travel and more all releasing their quarterly results.We have expert analysis, so you can better understand the numbers and what they say about the health of the American economy.Let's talk, Neil.That's another trending ticker here on Yahoo Finance when you take a look at the move lower here, off just about 5% the company reporting a wider than expected loss in the first quarter, vehicle deliveries falling by 3% from a year ago.The big story here is the increase in competition.You can see those deliveries falling 3% to just above 30,000, not entirely a massive surprise here from the street.Remember, Neo did guide the fact that they were expecting or lowered their forecast for deliveries for the quarter.Back in March, they lowered it down to 30,000 from their previous estimate of 31 to 33,000.But the real story here is the increase in competition, right?What exactly?That means not only for domestic players in China but also what it ultimately means for larger US automakers trying to compete within that space.We've seen Tesla obviously have a very, very tough time over recent quarters trying to make further inroads, trying to gain market share when you have these, uh, domestic players that are grabbing more of that.And even you can see from these results here neo also under a bit of pressure given that uptick in competition.The way to describe that pressure if you're looking at the stock chart is WW as you're taking a look at the shares year to date down by about 37%.I'm looking at the second quarter, though here going forward, the company expecting vehicle deliveries to be between 54 to 56,000 units, that actually would represent an increase of approximately 100 29% year over year Um, 100 29% to 100 38% on the top end.It's a range.So ultimately here, also looking at the revenues, they're expecting that to come in at about 2.3 to $2.37 billion round numbers there.So all these things considered it is really going to depend upon the movement that we're seeing in the EV market demand as you were mentioning as well.Story continuesOne of the worst performers in the S and P 500 this year is finally having a good go out, and shares of Lululemon are up right now by about 9% this morning on the back of results that surprised many bears that raided the stock prior to the report, the athletic retailer saw surging demand overseas as it navigates a more cautious consumer here in America and North America, specifically here for the Canadian based company for a deeper dive into the latest results.We're joined by Jeanine Stitcher, who's the BT IG consumer retail and lifestyle brands analyst.Great to have you here with us.Let's break this down because it was interesting, the strength that they're seeing in the non North American parts of the world.While it seems like there was some flattening here and that could perhaps impact some of the outlook as well, for sure, you have two pieces here.First, the international piece, which, as you mentioned, was extremely strong, particularly in China, which is a big part of the growth story.And then you have the Americas and look, the Americas did slow.We knew it would slow.They had told us that I think the important thing here was it was less bad than expected.Uh, the Americas overall were up about 4% in constant currency.Consensus was about three, but we'd heard numbers looking for a flat to maybe slightly down.So the big picture is that yes, we know there's some challenges in the US, but it's not getting worse, and it seems like they have a real handle on what they need to fix there.Do you think this is a big relief here for investors for shareholders?Given the challenges that Lululemon has faced here over the last couple of quarters, for sure, I think it's a huge sigh of relief.Um, there were a tonne of nerves coming into this quarter around the the America's business, potentially decelerating more than we expected.I remember we also had a management change.We had the chief product officer leaving just two weeks ago to go to bands, which is part of VF Corp. And I think that really spooked people.So there was a tonne of fear coming into this print.The bottom line is, it's things are OK.Things are stable, OK?And so with all of this in mind, I mean, looking across Lou Lemon's business here, the inventory mix was something that they were very positive and optimistic about.What's gonna be the driver from an inventory perspective, especially with the pricing strategy that they would have to roll out for anything new.Yeah, So I think when we came out of the Q four call, they had talked about some potential inventory challenges, not having the right colours and sizes, and they were able to get a better grasp on that as they went through the Q one call.So they talked about leggings in particular where they didn't have the right in stocks of the colours they needed, um, and accessories, which has been a strong growth driver.They're seeing growth on top of that now with some of their new or higher price items, but they just didn't have enough.So I think what we'll be looking for is, as we get through the balance of Q two, that's when we'll start to see those products corrected.Uh, they also talked about maybe just not having enough newness and innovation, and that sounds like it will really ramp up into the back half of the year.So right now it's kind of all eyes in the back half as we think about getting some of these inventory imbalances corrected and seeing a greater flow of newness in the assortment.Jeanine, when you take a look at the international side, I guess my question to you is, Is it going to be enough here to support sales growth to support some of that margin improvement that we have seen?Or should we expect a bit of a slide here, given some of the struggles that they're facing in the US?Yeah, I think the international is going to be a huge piece of the growth story and can help them support double digit growth over the medium term.If you look at China, they have proof of concept there.It's a billion dollar business just in mainland China, but they're still growing 40% plus annually and we think that can continue for a long time.With that said, I think as we think about the stock from here, people are really focused on the US business and we need to see that US business re accelerate the way that they're telling us it's going to in the back half for us to get a multiple on this stocks typical to what similar to what we've gotten in the past.So we're really looking for a re rating in the back half.As we see the US business re accelerate, we're We're seeing a tonne of new entrants into the golf landscape right now and that Sean is laughing at me right now.This is serious for me.I'm surprised it took us this long to get there kind of me, too.But at the end of the day, this is a major driver that the company is really looking forward to.As as a catalyst.How much of a catalyst is golf for Lululemon's business?I think golf is a catalyst, But more broadly, the men's business, I think, is a is a huge catalyst.And look, we've heard about a lot of viewers around competition, not just in golf but in men's in particular.Vio is one that stands out as coming up often in conversations, um, concerns around the growth impacting Lulu's men's business.But the men's business was still at 15% in Q one.So it's hard to say that that's having a meaningful impact.Um, in terms of the competition, we think overall, there's a lot of runway for for the male business, which is historically just been underserved for both Lulu and for the broader landscape.So I think that men's is still a big growth driver and wouldn't worry as much about the competition.I think it just kind of speaks to a market that has a a lot of white space in it.You know, it's interesting, especially over the course of this year.We've seen a lot of the performance where brands really lean into some of their big athletic profiles and their, you know, worldwide not names, if you will, whether that's new balance leaning into Coco golf or whether that's Nike and the of course treasure trove of different athletes that they work with, Um, over the course of this year, I mean, it's great that the NBA Finals are starting today.They could probably lean into Luka Danic a little bit more, Uh, or Jason Tatum.All these things considered.There's never a huge name that Lulu Lemon has had to hang its hat on.Do they need to start considering anyone?Yeah, I think their strategy has historically been more grassroots.And look, they still have celebrity endorsements.They still have athletes that they work with who maybe aren't as much household names as some of the other, uh, athletic brands but still are, are relatively well known in their fields and are are known for what they do.I think they're going to stick with that.I think it makes sense.It's more of a broad approach where they're trying to connect with the core consumers of these products.Having just one name that you attach yourself to and look, there can be risk with attaching yourself to just one or two big names, too.Um, those celebrity profiles can come and go.They can have their moments where they are extremely strong and moments where you rather not be as associated with them as much.So I think it's more of a broad strategy, a little bit more of a grassroots approach.I think that will continue to work for them versus trying to just sign up one or two big names and really taking a concentrated angle all right Lulu Lemon shares up just about 9% here this morning.Jeanine ST are BDIG is a consumer retail and lifestyle brands analyst.Thanks so much for joining us.Thank you.Time for some trending tickers.Dollar Tree shares.They are slipping after disclosing it is exploring a potential sale or spin off of family dollar as the company struggles to counter weaker demand.The company also saying it will close an additional 150 family dollar locations by the end of 2024.You're taking a look at shares right now, pre market down by about 1.9% here and the company as they've released this news.It came in tandem with their earnings, so you can really kind of compare Family Dollar.Same store sales are, uh, going up against the dollar tree segment.Same store sales.Net growth in this most recent quarter of dollar tree segment That was up by about 1.7%.Family dollar segment only up 1/10 of a percent here.And so all of these things considered, it's really this multi year journey to help the company fully achieve potential, the CEO saying and announcing a comprehensive review of the portfolio for family dollar, including plan closures of about 970 UNPROFOR stores.So this kind of continues in trajectory with what they had already announced there.Yeah, it's tough.And the story behind a company like this, as you talk about so much on your show wealth, Brad, is that this could be a sign of a consumer segment in this economy that is really starting to crack under the economic conditions.Now, just because that might be a lower income consumer, we may not be seeing it in the broader economic data that we break all the time.But these earnings give you a really good insight into which segment of the economy are starting to crack.And this could be a sign that that lower income consumer is starting to crack now.From the stock perspective, we are getting some analysts notes in bullish investors according to vital knowledge, pointing to decent and margin performance in Q one for this name here.But the EPS forecast trimmed only because of tornado damage, that is, according to the company, The question is, why are other companies not reporting similar damages there?So remains to be seen.How much that is going to impact Dollar tree Moving forward.We're getting a fresh read on the cautious consumer discount retailer Dollar Tree disclosed it's exploring a potential sale or spin off of family dollar as the company struggles to counter weaker demand amid inflation.But no matter how many deals, discounts or savings initiatives retailers roll out.Sometimes it seems like they can't do anything to change shoppers.Perceptions on prices.At least that's what our next guest says for more on the consumer and their spending habits.I'm joined by Sucharita Kalli, who is the Forester research retail analyst.Citta, great to see you here with us today.First.I mean, take us into your thesis right now about where the consumer sits.I mean it.It was amazing to hear from the AD P chief economist just minutes ago, saying that this is a battle weary consumer.What do you make of them and how, um how would you define this consumer?Yeah, we've had this expression, the Vibe session going on for a while, where the consumer has been feeling really down about the economy for a long time, pretty much um since inflation has been prevalent, uh, the consumer just hasn't felt good about it.Um, there's also a political overtone as well that, um pretty much dates back almost 10 years.At this point where whoever does not have their party in the White House, they tend to be very down on the economy.So in any economy, you're going to have 50% of people just unhappy with the current situation.So there is that.But the irony is that retail spending is at a record high, and consumers for a long time were spending at the level of inflation and then some.Only in recent months, with some of the census census data on monthly retail spend has some of that, uh, spending not exceeded the level of inflation.So we're seeing that the consumer is finally probably at their saturation point with respect to spending on some of these discretionary goods in particular.And even with spending at a record high, as you noted a moment ago, it seems like the consumer is being extremely value conscious about where they're spending, which brands are winning out or which retailers are winning out as that decision making process is being enacted.Well, certainly WalMart, Um, and that is a company that tends to do very well in any economy, but certainly in any in one where they the consumer confidence is particularly low.Um, you see even warehouse clubs doing well, and that's another element of this economy, which is it's almost it's K. It has a K type of recovery.K shaped recovery, Um, in which there are the affluent consumers who are doing well.And even though those consumers, like everybody, are looking for value, they tend to to to really gravitate toward those warehouse clubs.Um, so warehouse clubs are doing pretty well in this economy.You have a lot of eCommerce players like Amazon.Some of the Chinese upstarts like TMU, that seem to be doing particularly well right now.So those are some of the winners.You would think the Dollar channel would be doing well in this kind of an economy.And probably when you look at certain store profiles, they probably are, uh, but at the same time, the dollar channel is incredibly saturated.There are more dollar stores in the United States than just about any format, and you also have a lot of the dated, dated stores that are part of that family dollar chain dollar tree.Of course, acquired, that could be part of the reason that people are going to Wal Mart instead, Wal Mart has just spent a tonne of money renovating a lot of its stores, so it's just a more pleasant store environment that also delivers value.That's really interesting, you know, especially as we're hearing about some of the spin off intentions that Dollar Tree is talking about with Family Dollar, which underneath of it the same store sales, I mean a fraction of what we had seen in terms of the rise year over year for this most recent quarter.What do you make of that strategy?Especially as they've already been closing many of the unprofitable or under performing family dollar stores and kind of pivoting dollar tree in in certain elements to getting back towards, um, these prime locations, where it is more focused around selling for a dollar and where they can ultimately kind of retain consumer mind share there?Yeah, well, typically, um, stores sales are heavily dependent on whether or not, of course, people want to shop there and every few years, whether it's a decade, sometimes even longer.Stores need to be renovated because if they are not, um, they get very tired.They get dirty.It's, um, there There will be things that literally haven't been touched in that period of time that need to be cleared.And, uh, when a store does not make those changes or it's too expensive to make those changes, which it may not, because you have to remember.Um, the Family dollar chain has been around since the sixties, so a lot of those locations may just not be great locations anymore.Retail locations um cha the the success of retail locations changes geographic centres change as neighbourhood are developed.Um, the uh, the dollar tree at the dollar tree brand is is much newer, and, um, they likely are seeing better comps as a result of just having some of those better locations.So so certainly the renovation piece is a big part of it, and it sounds like they just don't want to invest right now in some of that renovation, and that's that's part of the reason that they're looking to divest.But the question then is like, Well, where are you going to make make up the difference?Well, they did purchase, um, about half of the 99 cent store chain with what's left of it there.And that could be an interesting one, because 99 cents store is actually has a pretty cult following.Um, it exists to support essentially food deserts in a lot of the southern California and, uh, South southwester part of the United States.So, um, that could be some the ways that they they look to to have a a different strategy, situated just lastly, while we have you here, we got a company that's gonna be reporting earnings later on today in Lululemon.That could be a barometer of to what extent high income is perhaps continuing to spend or middle income might be trading down into, uh, an Athleta, if you will.Even what are you gonna be looking out for there?Well, Lulu's been doing pretty well.They've been growing double digits, so I'd be surprised if we didn't see similar numbers today.They have been one of the retailers that's absolutely been gaining share.While the apparel industry overall has struggled, Um and certainly even with with in comparison to other athletic apparel, um, merchants and brands like Nike, Adidas under Armour Lulu's definitely been outperforming them.So, um, so so But if we do see anything soft, I do think that it suggests it could be a harbinger of, uh, consumer sentiment.Finally, um, you know, kind of bringing down those inflation numbers probably finally, to the level that the Fed would like, um, in in the coming months.Soita always a pleasure to get some of your insights and analysis.Such Rita Kalli, who is the Forester research retail analyst.Great to see you.One of the hottest stocks in the market today, our shares of H PE.After a much better than expected quarter and a pretty upbeat outlook, I made all things a I Let's get right to H PE CEO Antonio Neri Antonio always great to get some time.You and boy, uh, we were sitting here three months ago.This was a different story.We're talking about some delayed orders.Maybe things slowing down a little bit, But I didn't get that vibe.Uh, on this quarter, What in the world happened here?Well, Brian, uh, thanks for having me today.Uh, actually, we have been a consistent story.I think the market is finally waking up to the idea that HP has a big role to play in a I.And I'm very pleased on the fact that we continue to execute the strategy and delivering the results.We did like in Q two, where you see that we beat revenues and non gap earnings per share on the back of the, uh the, uh a I system revenue conversion, which more than doubled from Q one now exceeding $900 million for the quarter.So HP is uniquely positioned to capture the A. I inflexion point that we see continue to drive the momentum hybrid cloud.And obviously, the networking piece of this is super important as the market in that particular segment recovers.But today is an A I story, no question.And, uh, as we think about the market evolution, we continue to see very strong demand.We continue to see that demand accelerating and what I'm really pleased about the demand is now that more than 15% of our cumulative orders now represent enterprise A I you've always been good in in sharing, uh, how much?In terms of dollar value in orders of a I related, uh, products and services you have.What's the number now?Because you have been very consistent with us.Every quarter we talk to you, Antonio.That number has gone up pretty significantly.Yeah, we execute two with a cumulative A I order book of $4.6 billion.In that number, we converted more than $900 million in revenues.But what is important to realise is that that revenue had solid gross margins operative margins.And that's because we have been very prudent in managing our structure, being super disciplined about the deals we pursue where we see path to profitability, but most importantly, drive our portfolio of products and services without just focusing on the server itself.And you can see in our disclosures, Brian, is that we start disclosing the services pull through, which is now getting bigger and bigger also because in many of these deals we actually not only ship the server but actually provide the full data centre infrastructure, and actually, we run those assists on behalf of customers.Last time we talked to Antonio.You really one of the first executives to bring up to me, at least in the in the tech space companies, having trouble implementing the A I stuff they are ordering because of of energy, they couldn't get enough energy into their various systems.Where does that stand now?We're still constrained, Brian.We're still constrained.And as I think about the future right, we're gonna be constrained.It's not just the space.Obviously, there is a lot of new build outs that we see in the market in the US and but also in other geographies.I think the sovereign clouds will have incremental demands on that data centre capacity.And obviously we need more clean energy, more sustainable energy as we go forward.And as you think about this, uh, silicon accelerated computer that's coming next, As you saw in the road maps announced by NVIDIA, for example, they would require 100% directly with cooling.That's a unique opportunity for H PE, because H PE is one of the only companies that can actually do all type of cooling air cool, which is the traditional way to do it today.But that's not going to be sufficient when you exceed the 1000 watts per socket and the next generation is going to be close to 1700 watts.Then you have what I call the hybrid, which is most of the companies do today.There is a 70% liquid cool but also using funds to cool the environment.NHP does both, but what HP is unique is the 100% direct liquid cooling.And we have done this for many customers.And in fact, through three of the largest system we have deployed for generative A. I are today 100% direct liquid cooling.So it's a combination of space cooling and the technology used to cool this.This cool down the systems with direct liquid cooling.Yeah, it sounds like you got a lot of cool stuff working, Antonio.Why?Why were the margins down in your various segments and when did those start to improve?Well, I think overall margins, uh, were now because of the mix of the business, right?So obviously, as we know, the the networking market is going through a transition, and we have done a fantastic job over the last two years, adding $2 billion of revenue in our networking segment, which obviously comes with a different structural growth margin profile.And as the market is going through, the, uh, what I call digestion of the inventories, by the way, we expect a modest demand improvement in networking as we go forward here, which is a positive news.Obviously, that drives the entire company's margin.But if you look at our server segment, we grew revenues 18% and we deliver 11% operating profit, which is in the ranges.We guided the street between 11 and 13% so it's very, very positive, since you worked so closely with NVIDIA Jensen for a while.I imagine how important is that company to the the A. I build out around the world because all we hear about Media Land is, uh, maybe there's an A I bubble.Uh, they can't get off chips out.We see a MD doing chips.But just from an NVIDIA perspective, like how important are they?I think they are changing the world with an amazing innovation, obviously, that the company and Jensen himself have been driving for more than two decades.You know when you hear him talking about it, right?It has taken him personally two decades to get where we are today.I think we're all a little bit surprised about the advancement of generative A I from the algorithm perspective.But from the silicon perspective, I'm no surprise at all.And so I think, you know, together with a company like us, we will change the world for better in my mind.And HP has unique value to bring to the table through our expertise of decades.You know, deploying a I, a scale to our services organisation to the ability to build this system.Brian So HP today is one of the largest companies that has the water cool, uh, infrastructure to build the system.It's not just cooling the systems, but to build the systems.You need a lot of water capacity and power to build it.NHP has one of the largest footprint, so Jensen understands that, but ultimately we engineer solutions in a way that is easy to deploy.This is going to come down to the experience, not just the system performance and the sustainability of the systems and the return on investor capital.But it's going to be that experience and enterprises need a simplified experience to deploy this amazing technology, which is going to change the world forever.Pretty amazing.Time to Be in Tech Well, good session for shares of HP After a better than expected quarter and relatively upbeat Alec Antonio N, we'll talk to you soon.Thank you, Brian Company name that were watching in the consumer space Campbell Soup that company shares, after reporting third quarter net sales grew over 6% from a year ago, are moving to the downside here.The company is nearly 15% jump in food and beverage sales, offsetting it's 2% decline in snacks now.Interesting to see the meal and beverage sales coming in above estimates at 1.2 billion.That is above the estimate of 1.2 billion snack sales, though, as I mentioned coming in a full percentage point down, the estimate was that they would be nearly a full percentage point up.So that is clearly a big miss here and interesting to see that given that again, this is a name that you do is kind of the opposite story of a dollar tree because sometimes you expect Campbells to do well when people are switching that they like a soup, for example, in tough economic times.But maybe cutting back on snacks, transitioning over to meals.Yeah, pantry staple here, a good Camden, New Jersey, company shout out to East Philadelphia.Everybody, the real ones now but all the end.At the end of the day, it really does come back to what they're looking at and some of the sequential volume improvement that they're trying to deliver here, plus organic net sales.And that's what the company's president and CEO Klaus, who's a good friend of Yahoo Finance as well talked about in this most recent, uh, quarter here also gotta remember that they just finally were able to integrate sass SOS brands.I'm still gonna forever have questions about the pronunciation of that, but they're also already saying that that's bringing some of the incremental growth as they continue to navigate the pace of consumer recovery.As you were mentioning a moment ago here, let's get to another report, though, and that is from crowd strike that stock down a little more than 1% or just for share in the first quarter, beating estimates, revenue also of $921 million.Also a beating estimates here.And it looks like the company second quarter forecast for both earnings and the revenue is well above what analysts had been anticipating.It's also raising its forecast for full year earnings per share and full year revenue.But the stock is down.Yeah, I you know, expectations were high, you know, heading into this one, Julie and the stock was up, like, more than 20% year to date.Um, and it it I think for this sector, we've we Listen, we've talked a lot about the names in this sector as a reported earnings.It has been kind of choppy, right?Choppy environment if you're bullish.And there are a lot of bulls on this name by the ring, I mean, it's like NVIDIA like love for crowd strike.I mean, more than 90% of analysts have a buy ring.Um, I think it's because you must.You're betting.Listen, the the company can kind of execute through that choppiness on the call.You can have a lot of questions about new products and obviously for CO. George Kurtz, you know, lots of questions about pricing.Competition shares kind of dip in here, at least in the Yeah.I mean, as you said, they've done well into this report, but not crazy.Well, I mean, they're up about 20% a year to date.Kurtz, by the way, in this statement here talked about the company's momentum and strength.Um, going into this quarter, he talked about the competitive moat that the company has from its falcon platform, Um, and the customer that they're seeing demand from customers of all size here.So, you know, unclear where there is any disappointment, if any.The company also is talking about record free cash flow of $322 million.That revenue number, by the way, for the quarter up 33% year over year.And so you just moved the stock.You flipped it into the green that I did it.Julie Hyman.There you go.And body work shares are sinking this morning after its second quarter sales forecast coming in below expectations now expecting a decline of 2% to flat moving forward now, the company did slightly boost the bottom end of its earnings guidance for the full year.But we all know we're always looking for that top line number for these companies, and they did not deliver on that top line number.That is why we're seeing Bath and Body works down over seven.And in the pre market trade here, they again have better than expected results across the board.But their Q one outlook was spooky for investors, and we're seeing shares down off of that.Their net sales were also down.We're seeing nearly 8000 call options on this name ahead of the market.Open bread.Yeah, it kind of stinks honestly.And and here's why.You look at the broader environment from the amount of people that are spending in little luxuries right now.That scented candle little luxury that added, you know, hair wash or any of the kind of body gels that you might be using a little luxury that people are tapping into.You're hearing success in parts of other businesses, and bath and body works is signalling, and it's outlook that it's gonna be weaker than expected.That's not good for shareholders who are trying to evaluate OK, if a consumer spending into this, that means that they're trading away from your brand right now, especially if other companies are saying something that is counter to the guidance that you're putting out as of this time.So all of that in mind, uh, putting a little bit of a number on this?They said it was a strong start to the year please, though, to narrow their full year guidance range while raising the midpoint for the top and bottom line.So it's gonna be interesting to see how they meet that end, where, ultimately some of the consumer sentiment shifts towards when you're spending into, uh, the little luxuries of everything from body scrubs, facial oils and I. I don't know whatever makes people self care Saturday come to life.Well, it's a great point, and I know you talk about this a lot on your show wealth as well, right?It's this idea that consumers are starting to struggle, particularly on the low end and a bath and body works is a more economic brand.So it's not really that surprising when you see this stock struggling a little bit today.Z Scaler, reporting a strong third quarter on the top and bottom lines last week, the company also boosted its fiscal year guidance against the backdrop of more cautious guidance from peers in the cyber security sector.For more we're now bringing in Z scaler.CEO Jay Choudhry.Jay, it is good to have you on the show.And you know, Jay, this is the first time we've had a chance to talk to you since you reported results.Jay, you reported you beat the stock jumped.Maybe.Start that there, Jay.Walk us through what drove the quarter.So cyber is the number one concern for CIO C, SOS and boats.But they also have to worry about cost savings.Uh, market is tight.There's a lot of deal scrutiny.C skier is a unique provider where we provide the best cyber security with zero trust architecture.But we also reduce cost because we eliminate a bunch of legacy security point products, firewalls, VPN, S and more.So that's why we're able to close business.Uh, by doing both at the same time.Hey, Jay, it's Julie here.It's good to see you.Um, you guys recently reported a cyber breach, I believe.What can you tell us about that?And did that have any kind of effect in the quarter or or in the present quarter.So there's no breach per SE.There's a claim breach, so to speak.The social media can do all kinds of stuff.Yes, we we did have, uh, an engineer trying to play with a new server in a Q environment.Single machine that was out there discovered that was being set up.So there's a lot of basis for it.There's none to it.We're very transparent with customers.We kept in communication, but it had no impact.Rather, customers came and said, Wow, you guys had great transparent communication.We love it, Jay, when we have you, it's always worth getting your kind of broader take on the threat landscape, Jay.I mean, a lot of threats, rogue states, bad actors, criminal gangs.What are you seeing out there, Jay?They the two main areas.One.The people who want to make money quick, so ran somewhere on the rise.And then there are nation states trying to steal secrets.Those are the two big buckets, and they are leveraging by getting on the network of the company.Moving laterally find high value assets and going after that.So zero trust architecture is being clearly looked at as the primary solution for it.The reason zero zalar growth is happening is because companies are embracing zero trust architecture that we pioneered.You talked about China just now.The big threat from China is that all large companies who are present in China, they have a network coming from China all the way to the US or Europe.Bad guys can get on the network in China, travel and try to infect stuff out there.We allow you not to have a network connected to China or other countries and still have secure communication.Those are the type of things enterprises and fed government organisations need to do to secure themselves.And Jay, of course, Um, this is an election year not only in the US.We just had an election in Mexico.We just had an election in India, and I know that when you're talking about breaches or insecure communications, that's a very different issue than misinformation and disinformation.But I'm just curious what you are seeing if anything sort of linked to geopolitics around the globe.So we do track it though it's not our primary focus.We are seeing uptake of this information.Uh uh.We have a research team that actually tries to figure out what content is generated by Gen. A. I and what what content is created by people.It's fascinating to see you can actually tell the difference.And we're seeing a lot more content that's being put out Put out there that Gen A. I is creating.So all of us have to need need to worry about it.Jay, I wanna talk to you on on competition real quickly and specifically Microsoft, uh, moving into your world.You know, I. I was checking with an analyst, Jay, who covers, uh, the company.And he was saying, Listen, that that is, in his opinion, creating some noise in the market and on the street.Um, what are you seeing, Jay?Well, large companies like Microsoft, they want to expand in all areas, right?So I'm not surprised that they're trying to expand in our area.They have had overlapping products for a while.Microsoft windows has VPN built in for a long, long time.But when I talk to large enterprises, they asked for two things.Number one, they said.I want a security provider like a Switzerland who can equally support my security to access office 365 azure AWS, GCP and scores of SAS applications.We are in a better position to do that than an application provider like Microsoft number two with all the issue you're seeing out there with midnight blizzard.I'm sure you saw the report that came from federal government about some of those issues.More and more customers want application provider to be different from security provider separation of applications and security is a better thing.You don't want a fox was the henhouse Jay.We always appreciate you coming on the show.Thank you.Josh and Julie, Thank you for the opportunity.Hope to talk to you again.There was another strong quarter for Costco.Same store sales increased the most in five quarters as consumers continue to look for value in groceries, and the retailer also said more members are purchasing more discretionary at a time where inflation remains sticky.For a deeper dive into the Costco results.We're joined Oliver Chen TD Cowan, senior research analyst, here.All right, is that Is that a Kirkland.Uh, wait a minute.That is a Costco sweater crew neck sweater.My goodness.OK, man dresses the part.Stays with the time here, Oliver.I mean, just take us into your thesis here.Brad, we're really excited about the results at Costco.Costco is a really unique company.As you know, that focuses on value.It's one of our big ideas.They'll be at our conference next week.But what's really happening is continued graphic momentum, which is quite positive.Renewal rates at 93% which is quite high, and customers are looking for value.This is Costco's core competency.The Kirkland brand is also famous for offering outstanding value across the portfolio.That's about 30% of the business.So overall, um, we we are impressed with these strong results.And, as you know, the consumer is facing many cross currents.You mentioned in your comments that Costco is seeing some benefits from non-food product.That's a huge positive, too, because we're not yet seeing that at other retailers such as target.So as inflation starts to cool a bit, uh, Costco is an early sign of this, and this company is benefiting a new CFO as well.Oliver, When it comes to, I'm curious to your take on the stock reaction here, with it being off 2% it looks like a strong quarter.Is that just reflective of current valuation?The fact that we close at an all time high heading into this print?Yes, that's true.The PE multiples at 45 times the three year average, is closer to 35 and Walmart's at 22 times.So as we think about Costco's valuation, it's expensive.But in our opinion, it's worth it.It's a different kind of retailer and that it's a membership model and about half of the profitability is membership.So that's very sticky and recurring.And also this is one of the few retailers that's a US retailer that's very global.Unit growth in Asia and China is also impressive.So, Oliver, what do you think that upside, then looks like shirts are already up over 20% since the start of the year?Yeah, we're excited about this because it's a defensive name in terms of the food exposure and this real core competency for value.But there's also a technology angle here, too, in terms of Costco's personalization, their mobile app, their partnerships with Instacart and uber and the marketplace model as well as digital advertising.So a lot can be ahead, and Costco has a very loyal, engaged customer.Also, you can't get any prices lower than what you can get at Costco, given that the business model is set around 11% markups, and it's very strict.So you're getting the best deal possible on this sweatshirt as well as this jewellery and the food.And it's also a treasure hunt.Um, the future of retail is about these in-store treasure hunts, and that's what you really need to captivate customers to get in store as well.Wait, The chains are from Costco to Oliver.Yeah, they are a top jewellery seller.They're actually one of the top diamond sellers.So you know, this company really surprises and delights.And when you go into a Costco, as you know, you find things you never knew you needed or wanted.And that's part of the magic of Costco.I think we're witnessing Pete Oliver trend right now.Oliver, I think you're in your zone.You're in your element.You feel you look comfortable.You look good.At the end of the day, you think about where Costco sits among the broader universe that you cover right now.How do you look at them versus some of the competition?Yeah, What we see is bifurcation.So Brad Costco's household income on our survey data is much higher than Walmart or Target or Sam's Club.Um, that's a big benefit.And as you know, I do cover a wide range of stocks.But we like very, uh, strong luxury stocks, Uh, such as LV MH.And then we look for value stocks such as Walmart, which is offering a very exceptional value to customers.Costco is a offering exceptional value to customers, but it also has a higher household income customer.And there's a technology personalization opportunity, too.So it fits a lot of boxes in terms of our themes.Um, the bottom line is that we are in this consumer environment that's somewhat bumpy and cautious, and inflation is still bothering consumers.So everybody's looking for low prices, and Costco squarely fits in here as well as this merchandise execution, which is really to to what Costco does.The other point is, Costco only has about 3500 items.Walmart has 200,000 plus.So Costco can be very agile and how they manage these items and also deliver a lot of expertise and precision in terms of a great item at a great price, such as this chain, such as a sweater such as a lot of the liquor.It's great.All right, Oliver Chen, you sold us.TD.Cowan, senior research analyst.Thanks so much for joining us here again.Costco shares Sea Quarter, but the stock under a bit of pressure here, off just about 2% in early trading.Let's take a look at Dell.Those shares they're actually plunging after its gross margins fell 2.5% during the first quarter.A surging demand for its A I servers took a toll.Dell shares, though still up over 100 and 20% so far this year.So, yes, the massive decline that we're seeing at the Open that clearly is catching investors' attention it off just around 18%.But you gotta remember that this is a stock that has been off to the races since the start of the year and taking a look inside this quarter.Some of the concerns, obviously very lofty expectations.You can see by the results or by the reaction that we're getting here in the street.They weren't satisfied here with these numbers.When it comes to what exactly we heard here, sales did increase 6.3% to 22.2 billion here for the quarter.When you take a look at profit excluding items, that was a dollar 27 to share, compared to the average projection of just around a dollar 23.But again, we're looking at losses here at the open, with shares off just about 17%.Yeah, some hit on operating income.That was down by about 14% during the quarter.Uh, no doubt they were paying close attention to that.Investors paying close attention to that.And then I was looking at one other element of the business here.Uh, where was the operating income within ISG Infrastructure Solutions group here.And so, uh, kind of, uh, a larger question mark of within the continued expansion or kind of focusing in on a I optimising, uh, a I optimisation here across their business units and their segments where companies like Dell, like some of the others over the course of this earning season, have said that they need to spend more in order to continue to make more or capitalise more on a run rate that they are forecasting at this juncture.So, um, hopefully some continued updates on that front and by Donna saying, I think summarising it pretty well here.Results weren't bad, but expectations were very high in these numbers.Just simply were not strong enough to stop a further near term or strong enough to spur further near term upside, and as a result, you're seeing the shares off just about 17%.",

all releasing their quarterly results we have expert analysis  so you can better understand the numbers and what they say about the health of the american economy let s talk  neil that s another trending ticker here on yahoo finance when you take a look at the move lower here  off just about 5  the company reporting a wider than expected loss in the first quarter  vehicle deliveries falling by 3  from a year ago the big story here is the increase in competition you can see those deliveries falling 3  to just above 30 000  not entirely a massive surprise here from the street remember  neo did guide the fact that they were expecting or lowered their forecast for deliveries for the quarter back in march  they lowered it down to 30 000 from their previous estimate of 31 to 33 000 but the real story here is the increase in competition  right what exactly that means not only for domestic players in china but also what it ultimately means for larger us automakers trying to compete within that space we ve seen tesla obviously have a very  very tough time over recent quarters trying to make further inroads  trying to gain market share when you have these  uh  domestic players that are grabbing more of that and even you can see from these results here neo also under a bit of pressure given that uptick in competition the way to describe that pressure if you re looking at the stock chart is ww as you re taking a look at the shares year to date down by about 37  i m looking at the second quarter  though here going forward  the company expecting vehicle deliveries to be between 54 to 56 000 units  that actually would represent an increase of approximately 100 29  year over year um  100 29  to 100 38  on the top end it s a range so ultimately here  also looking at the revenues  they re expecting that to come in at about 2 3 to  2 37 billion round numbers there so all these things considered it is really going to depend upon the movement that we re seeing in the ev market demand as you were mentioning as well story continuesone of the worst performers in the s and p 500 this year is finally having a good go out  and shares of lululemon are up right now by about 9  this morning on the back of results that surprised many bears that raided the stock prior to the report  the athletic retailer saw surging demand overseas as it navigates a more cautious consumer here in america and north america  specifically here for the canadian based company for a deeper dive into the latest results we re joined by jeanine stitcher  who s the bt ig consumer retail and lifestyle brands analyst great to have you here with us let s break this down because it was interesting  the strength that they re seeing in the non north american parts of the world while it seems like there was some flattening here and that could perhaps impact some of the outlook as well  for sure  you have two pieces here first  the international piece  which  as you mentioned  was extremely strong  particularly in china  which is a big part of the growth story and then you have the americas and look  the americas did slow we knew it would slow they had told us that i think the important thing here was it was less bad than expected uh  the americas overall were up about 4  in constant currency consensus was about three  but we d heard numbers looking for a flat to maybe slightly down so the big picture is that yes  we know there s some challenges in the us  but it s not getting worse  and it seems like they have a real handle on what they need to fix there do you think this is a big relief here for investors for shareholders given the challenges that lululemon has faced here over the last couple of quarters  for sure  i think it s a huge sigh of relief um  there were a tonne of nerves coming into this quarter around the the america s business  potentially decelerating more than we expected i remember we also had a management change we had the chief product officer leaving just two weeks ago to go to bands  which is part of vf corp  and i think that really spooked people so there was a tonne of fear coming into this print the bottom line is  it s things are ok things are stable  ok and so with all of this in mind  i mean  looking across lou lemon s business here  the inventory mix was something that they were very positive and optimistic about what s gonna be the driver from an inventory perspective  especially with the pricing strategy that they would have to roll out for anything new yeah  so i think when we came out of the q four call  they had talked about some potential inventory challenges  not having the right colours and sizes  and they were able to get a better grasp on that as they went through the q one call so they talked about leggings in particular where they didn t have the right in stocks of the colours they needed  um  and accessories  which has been a strong growth driver they re seeing growth on top of that now with some of their new or higher price items  but they just didn t have enough so i think what we ll be looking for is  as we get through the balance of q two  that s when we ll start to see those products corrected uh  they also talked about maybe just not having enough newness and innovation  and that sounds like it will really ramp up into the back half of the year so right now it s kind of all eyes in the back half as we think about getting some of these inventory imbalances corrected and seeing a greater flow of newness in the assortment jeanine  when you take a look at the international side  i guess my question to you is  is it going to be enough here to support sales growth to support some of that margin improvement that we have seen or should we expect a bit of a slide here  given some of the struggles that they re facing in the us yeah  i think the international is going to be a huge piece of the growth story and can help them support double digit growth over the medium term if you look at china  they have proof of concept there it s a billion dollar business just in mainland china  but they re still growing 40  plus annually and we think that can continue for a long time with that said  i think as we think about the stock from here  people are really focused on the us business and we need to see that us business re accelerate the way that they re telling us it s going to in the back half for us to get a multiple on this stocks typical to what similar to what we ve gotten in the past so we re really looking for a re rating in the back half as we see the us business re accelerate  we re we re seeing a tonne of new entrants into the golf landscape right now and that sean is laughing at me right now this is serious for me i m surprised it took us this long to get there kind of me  too but at the end of the day  this is a major driver that the company is really looking forward to as as a catalyst how much of a catalyst is golf for lululemon s business i think golf is a catalyst  but more broadly  the men s business  i think  is a is a huge catalyst and look  we ve heard about a lot of viewers around competition  not just in golf but in men s in particular vio is one that stands out as coming up often in conversations  um  concerns around the growth impacting lulu s men s business but the men s business was still at 15  in q one so it s hard to say that that s having a meaningful impact um  in terms of the competition  we think overall  there s a lot of runway for for the male business  which is historically just been underserved for both lulu and for the broader landscape so i think that men s is still a big growth driver and wouldn t worry as much about the competition i think it just kind of speaks to a market that has a a lot of white space in it you know  it s interesting  especially over the course of this year we ve seen a lot of the performance where brands really lean into some of their big athletic profiles and their  you know  worldwide not names  if you will  whether that s new balance leaning into coco golf or whether that s nike and the of course treasure trove of different athletes that they work with  um  over the course of this year  i mean  it s great that the nba finals are starting today they could probably lean into luka danic a little bit more  uh  or jason tatum all these things considered there s never a huge name that lulu lemon has had to hang its hat on do they need to start considering anyone yeah  i think their strategy has historically been more grassroots and look  they still have celebrity endorsements they still have athletes that they work with who maybe aren t as much household names as some of the other  uh  athletic brands but still are  are relatively well known in their fields and are are known for what they do i think they re going to stick with that i think it makes sense it s more of a broad approach where they re trying to connect with the core consumers of these products having just one name that you attach yourself to and look  there can be risk with attaching yourself to just one or two big names  too um  those celebrity profiles can come and go they can have their moments where they are extremely strong and moments where you rather not be as associated with them as much so i think it s more of a broad strategy  a little bit more of a grassroots approach i think that will continue to work for them versus trying to just sign up one or two big names and really taking a concentrated angle all right lulu lemon shares up just about 9  here this morning jeanine st are bdig is a consumer retail and lifestyle brands analyst thanks so much for joining us thank you time for some trending tickers dollar tree shares they are slipping after disclosing it is exploring a potential sale or spin off of family dollar as the company struggles to counter weaker demand the company also saying it will close an additional 150 family dollar locations by the end of 2024 you re taking a look at shares right now  pre market down by about 1 9  here and the company as they ve released this news it came in tandem with their earnings  so you can really kind of compare family dollar same store sales are  uh  going up against the dollar tree segment same store sales net growth in this most recent quarter of dollar tree segment that was up by about 1 7  family dollar segment only up 1 10 of a percent here and so all of these things considered  it s really this multi year journey to help the company fully achieve potential  the ceo saying and announcing a comprehensive review of the portfolio for family dollar  including plan closures of about 970 unprofor stores so this kind of continues in trajectory with what they had already announced there yeah  it s tough and the story behind a company like this  as you talk about so much on your show wealth  brad  is that this could be a sign of a consumer segment in this economy that is really starting to crack under the economic conditions now  just because that might be a lower income consumer  we may not be seeing it in the broader economic data that we break all the time but these earnings give you a really good insight into which segment of the economy are starting to crack and this could be a sign that that lower income consumer is starting to crack now from the stock perspective  we are getting some analysts notes in bullish investors according to vital knowledge  pointing to decent and margin performance in q one for this name here but the eps forecast trimmed only because of tornado damage  that is  according to the company  the question is  why are other companies not reporting similar damages there so remains to be seen how much that is going to impact dollar tree moving forward we re getting a fresh read on the cautious consumer discount retailer dollar tree disclosed it s exploring a potential sale or spin off of family dollar as the company struggles to counter weaker demand amid inflation but no matter how many deals  discounts or savings initiatives retailers roll out sometimes it seems like they can t do anything to change shoppers perceptions on prices at least that s what our next guest says for more on the consumer and their spending habits i m joined by sucharita kalli  who is the forester research retail analyst citta  great to see you here with us today first i mean  take us into your thesis right now about where the consumer sits i mean it it was amazing to hear from the ad p chief economist just minutes ago  saying that this is a battle weary consumer what do you make of them and how  um how would you define this consumer yeah  we ve had this expression  the vibe session going on for a while  where the consumer has been feeling really down about the economy for a long time  pretty much um since inflation has been prevalent  uh  the consumer just hasn t felt good about it um  there s also a political overtone as well that  um pretty much dates back almost 10 years at this point where whoever does not have their party in the white house  they tend to be very down on the economy so in any economy  you re going to have 50  of people just unhappy with the current situation so there is that but the irony is that retail spending is at a record high  and consumers for a long time were spending at the level of inflation and then some only in recent months  with some of the census census data on monthly retail spend has some of that  uh  spending not exceeded the level of inflation so we re seeing that the consumer is finally probably at their saturation point with respect to spending on some of these discretionary goods in particular and even with spending at a record high  as you noted a moment ago  it seems like the consumer is being extremely value conscious about where they re spending  which brands are winning out or which retailers are winning out as that decision making process is being enacted well  certainly walmart  um  and that is a company that tends to do very well in any economy  but certainly in any in one where they the consumer confidence is particularly low um  you see even warehouse clubs doing well  and that s another element of this economy  which is it s almost it s k  it has a k type of recovery k shaped recovery  um  in which there are the affluent consumers who are doing well and even though those consumers  like everybody  are looking for value  they tend to to to really gravitate toward those warehouse clubs um  so warehouse clubs are doing pretty well in this economy you have a lot of ecommerce players like amazon some of the chinese upstarts like tmu  that seem to be doing particularly well right now so those are some of the winners you would think the dollar channel would be doing well in this kind of an economy and probably when you look at certain store profiles  they probably are  uh  but at the same time  the dollar channel is incredibly saturated there are more dollar stores in the united states than just about any format  and you also have a lot of the dated  dated stores that are part of that family dollar chain dollar tree of course  acquired  that could be part of the reason that people are going to wal mart instead  wal mart has just spent a tonne of money renovating a lot of its stores  so it s just a more pleasant store environment that also delivers value that s really interesting  you know  especially as we re hearing about some of the spin off intentions that dollar tree is talking about with family dollar  which underneath of it the same store sales  i mean a fraction of what we had seen in terms of the rise year over year for this most recent quarter what do you make of that strategy especially as they ve already been closing many of the unprofitable or under performing family dollar stores and kind of pivoting dollar tree in in certain elements to getting back towards  um  these prime locations  where it is more focused around selling for a dollar and where they can ultimately kind of retain consumer mind share there yeah  well  typically  um  stores sales are heavily dependent on whether or not  of course  people want to shop there and every few years  whether it s a decade  sometimes even longer stores need to be renovated because if they are not  um  they get very tired they get dirty it s  um  there there will be things that literally haven t been touched in that period of time that need to be cleared and  uh  when a store does not make those changes or it s too expensive to make those changes  which it may not  because you have to remember um  the family dollar chain has been around since the sixties  so a lot of those locations may just not be great locations anymore retail locations um cha the the success of retail locations changes geographic centres change as neighbourhood are developed um  the uh  the dollar tree at the dollar tree brand is is much newer  and  um  they likely are seeing better comps as a result of just having some of those better locations so so certainly the renovation piece is a big part of it  and it sounds like they just don t want to invest right now in some of that renovation  and that s that s part of the reason that they re looking to divest but the question then is like  well  where are you going to make make up the difference well  they did purchase  um  about half of the 99 cent store chain with what s left of it there and that could be an interesting one  because 99 cents store is actually has a pretty cult following um  it exists to support essentially food deserts in a lot of the southern california and  uh  south southwester part of the united states so  um  that could be some the ways that they they look to to have a a different strategy  situated just lastly  while we have you here  we got a company that s gonna be reporting earnings later on today in lululemon that could be a barometer of to what extent high income is perhaps continuing to spend or middle income might be trading down into  uh  an athleta  if you will even what are you gonna be looking out for there well  lulu s been doing pretty well they ve been growing double digits  so i d be surprised if we didn t see similar numbers today they have been one of the retailers that s absolutely been gaining share while the apparel industry overall has struggled  um and certainly even with with in comparison to other athletic apparel  um  merchants and brands like nike  adidas under armour lulu s definitely been outperforming them so  um  so so but if we do see anything soft  i do think that it suggests it could be a harbinger of  uh  consumer sentiment finally  um  you know  kind of bringing down those inflation numbers probably finally  to the level that the fed would like  um  in in the coming months soita always a pleasure to get some of your insights and analysis such rita kalli  who is the forester research retail analyst great to see you one of the hottest stocks in the market today  our shares of h pe after a much better than expected quarter and a pretty upbeat outlook  i made all things a i let s get right to h pe ceo antonio neri antonio always great to get some time you and boy  uh  we were sitting here three months ago this was a different story we re talking about some delayed orders maybe things slowing down a little bit  but i didn t get that vibe uh  on this quarter  what in the world happened here well  brian  uh  thanks for having me today uh  actually  we have been a consistent story i think the market is finally waking up to the idea that hp has a big role to play in a i and i m very pleased on the fact that we continue to execute the strategy and delivering the results we did like in q two  where you see that we beat revenues and non gap earnings per share on the back of the  uh the  uh a i system revenue conversion  which more than doubled from q one now exceeding  900 million for the quarter so hp is uniquely positioned to capture the a  i inflexion point that we see continue to drive the momentum hybrid cloud and obviously  the networking piece of this is super important as the market in that particular segment recovers but today is an a i story  no question and  uh  as we think about the market evolution  we continue to see very strong demand we continue to see that demand accelerating and what i m really pleased about the demand is now that more than 15  of our cumulative orders now represent enterprise a i you ve always been good in in sharing  uh  how much in terms of dollar value in orders of a i related  uh  products and services you have what s the number now because you have been very consistent with us every quarter we talk to you  antonio that number has gone up pretty significantly yeah  we execute two with a cumulative a i order book of  4 6 billion in that number  we converted more than  900 million in revenues but what is important to realise is that that revenue had solid gross margins operative margins and that s because we have been very prudent in managing our structure  being super disciplined about the deals we pursue where we see path to profitability  but most importantly  drive our portfolio of products and services without just focusing on the server itself and you can see in our disclosures  brian  is that we start disclosing the services pull through  which is now getting bigger and bigger also because in many of these deals we actually not only ship the server but actually provide the full data centre infrastructure  and actually  we run those assists on behalf of customers last time we talked to antonio you really one of the first executives to bring up to me  at least in the in the tech space companies  having trouble implementing the a i stuff they are ordering because of of energy  they couldn t get enough energy into their various systems where does that stand now we re still constrained  brian we re still constrained and as i think about the future right  we re gonna be constrained it s not just the space obviously  there is a lot of new build outs that we see in the market in the us and but also in other geographies i think the sovereign clouds will have incremental demands on that data centre capacity and obviously we need more clean energy  more sustainable energy as we go forward and as you think about this  uh  silicon accelerated computer that s coming next  as you saw in the road maps announced by nvidia  for example  they would require 100  directly with cooling that s a unique opportunity for h pe  because h pe is one of the only companies that can actually do all type of cooling air cool  which is the traditional way to do it today but that s not going to be sufficient when you exceed the 1000 watts per socket and the next generation is going to be close to 1700 watts then you have what i call the hybrid  which is most of the companies do today there is a 70  liquid cool but also using funds to cool the environment nhp does both  but what hp is unique is the 100  direct liquid cooling and we have done this for many customers and in fact  through three of the largest system we have deployed for generative a  i are today 100  direct liquid cooling so it s a combination of space cooling and the technology used to cool this this cool down the systems with direct liquid cooling yeah  it sounds like you got a lot of cool stuff working  antonio why why were the margins down in your various segments and when did those start to improve well  i think overall margins  uh  were now because of the mix of the business  right so obviously  as we know  the the networking market is going through a transition  and we have done a fantastic job over the last two years  adding  2 billion of revenue in our networking segment  which obviously comes with a different structural growth margin profile and as the market is going through  the  uh  what i call digestion of the inventories  by the way  we expect a modest demand improvement in networking as we go forward here  which is a positive news obviously  that drives the entire company s margin but if you look at our server segment  we grew revenues 18  and we deliver 11  operating profit  which is in the ranges we guided the street between 11 and 13  so it s very  very positive  since you worked so closely with nvidia jensen for a while i imagine how important is that company to the the a  i build out around the world because all we hear about media land is  uh  maybe there s an a i bubble uh  they can t get off chips out we see a md doing chips but just from an nvidia perspective  like how important are they i think they are changing the world with an amazing innovation  obviously  that the company and jensen himself have been driving for more than two decades you know when you hear him talking about it  right it has taken him personally two decades to get where we are today i think we re all a little bit surprised about the advancement of generative a i from the algorithm perspective but from the silicon perspective  i m no surprise at all and so i think  you know  together with a company like us  we will change the world for better in my mind and hp has unique value to bring to the table through our expertise of decades you know  deploying a i  a scale to our services organisation to the ability to build this system brian so hp today is one of the largest companies that has the water cool  uh  infrastructure to build the system it s not just cooling the systems  but to build the systems you need a lot of water capacity and power to build it nhp has one of the largest footprint  so jensen understands that  but ultimately we engineer solutions in a way that is easy to deploy this is going to come down to the experience  not just the system performance and the sustainability of the systems and the return on investor capital but it s going to be that experience and enterprises need a simplified experience to deploy this amazing technology  which is going to change the world forever pretty amazing time to be in tech well  good session for shares of hp after a better than expected quarter and relatively upbeat alec antonio n  we ll talk to you soon thank you  brian company name that were watching in the consumer space campbell soup that company shares  after reporting third quarter net sales grew over 6  from a year ago  are moving to the downside here the company is nearly 15  jump in food and beverage sales  offsetting it s 2  decline in snacks now interesting to see the meal and beverage sales coming in above estimates at 1 2 billion that is above the estimate of 1 2 billion snack sales  though  as i mentioned coming in a full percentage point down  the estimate was that they would be nearly a full percentage point up so that is clearly a big miss here and interesting to see that given that again  this is a name that you do is kind of the opposite story of a dollar tree because sometimes you expect campbells to do well when people are switching that they like a soup  for example  in tough economic times but maybe cutting back on snacks  transitioning over to meals yeah  pantry staple here  a good camden  new jersey  company shout out to east philadelphia everybody  the real ones now but all the end at the end of the day  it really does come back to what they re looking at and some of the sequential volume improvement that they re trying to deliver here  plus organic net sales and that s what the company s president and ceo klaus  who s a good friend of yahoo finance as well talked about in this most recent  uh  quarter here also gotta remember that they just finally were able to integrate sass sos brands i m still gonna forever have questions about the pronunciation of that  but they re also already saying that that s bringing some of the incremental growth as they continue to navigate the pace of consumer recovery as you were mentioning a moment ago here  let s get to another report  though  and that is from crowd strike that stock down a little more than 1  or just for share in the first quarter  beating estimates  revenue also of  921 million also a beating estimates here and it looks like the company second quarter forecast for both earnings and the revenue is well above what analysts had been anticipating it s also raising its forecast for full year earnings per share and full year revenue but the stock is down yeah  i you know  expectations were high  you know  heading into this one  julie and the stock was up  like  more than 20  year to date um  and it it i think for this sector  we ve we listen  we ve talked a lot about the names in this sector as a reported earnings it has been kind of choppy  right choppy environment if you re bullish and there are a lot of bulls on this name by the ring  i mean  it s like nvidia like love for crowd strike i mean  more than 90  of analysts have a buy ring um  i think it s because you must you re betting listen  the the company can kind of execute through that choppiness on the call you can have a lot of questions about new products and obviously for co  george kurtz  you know  lots of questions about pricing competition shares kind of dip in here  at least in the yeah i mean  as you said  they ve done well into this report  but not crazy well  i mean  they re up about 20  a year to date kurtz  by the way  in this statement here talked about the company s momentum and strength um  going into this quarter  he talked about the competitive moat that the company has from its falcon platform  um  and the customer that they re seeing demand from customers of all size here so  you know  unclear where there is any disappointment  if any the company also is talking about record free cash flow of  322 million that revenue number  by the way  for the quarter up 33  year over year and so you just moved the stock you flipped it into the green that i did it julie hyman there you go and body work shares are sinking this morning after its second quarter sales forecast coming in below expectations now expecting a decline of 2  to flat moving forward now  the company did slightly boost the bottom end of its earnings guidance for the full year but we all know we re always looking for that top line number for these companies  and they did not deliver on that top line number that is why we re seeing bath and body works down over seven and in the pre market trade here  they again have better than expected results across the board but their q one outlook was spooky for investors  and we re seeing shares down off of that their net sales were also down we re seeing nearly 8000 call options on this name ahead of the market open bread yeah  it kind of stinks honestly and and here s why you look at the broader environment from the amount of people that are spending in little luxuries right now that scented candle little luxury that added  you know  hair wash or any of the kind of body gels that you might be using a little luxury that people are tapping into you re hearing success in parts of other businesses  and bath and body works is signalling  and it s outlook that it s gonna be weaker than expected that s not good for shareholders who are trying to evaluate ok  if a consumer spending into this  that means that they re trading away from your brand right now  especially if other companies are saying something that is counter to the guidance that you re putting out as of this time so all of that in mind  uh  putting a little bit of a number on this they said it was a strong start to the year please  though  to narrow their full year guidance range while raising the midpoint for the top and bottom line so it s gonna be interesting to see how they meet that end  where  ultimately some of the consumer sentiment shifts towards when you re spending into  uh  the little luxuries of everything from body scrubs  facial oils and i  i don t know whatever makes people self care saturday come to life well  it s a great point  and i know you talk about this a lot on your show wealth as well  right it s this idea that consumers are starting to struggle  particularly on the low end and a bath and body works is a more economic brand so it s not really that surprising when you see this stock struggling a little bit today z scaler  reporting a strong third quarter on the top and bottom lines last week  the company also boosted its fiscal year guidance against the backdrop of more cautious guidance from peers in the cyber security sector for more we re now bringing in z scaler ceo jay choudhry jay  it is good to have you on the show and you know  jay  this is the first time we ve had a chance to talk to you since you reported results jay  you reported you beat the stock jumped maybe start that there  jay walk us through what drove the quarter so cyber is the number one concern for cio c  sos and boats but they also have to worry about cost savings uh  market is tight there s a lot of deal scrutiny c skier is a unique provider where we provide the best cyber security with zero trust architecture but we also reduce cost because we eliminate a bunch of legacy security point products  firewalls  vpn  s and more so that s why we re able to close business uh  by doing both at the same time hey  jay  it s julie here it s good to see you um  you guys recently reported a cyber breach  i believe what can you tell us about that and did that have any kind of effect in the quarter or or in the present quarter so there s no breach per se there s a claim breach  so to speak the social media can do all kinds of stuff yes  we we did have  uh  an engineer trying to play with a new server in a q environment single machine that was out there discovered that was being set up so there s a lot of basis for it there s none to it we re very transparent with customers we kept in communication  but it had no impact rather  customers came and said  wow  you guys had great transparent communication we love it  jay  when we have you  it s always worth getting your kind of broader take on the threat landscape  jay i mean  a lot of threats  rogue states  bad actors  criminal gangs what are you seeing out there  jay they the two main areas one the people who want to make money quick  so ran somewhere on the rise and then there are nation states trying to steal secrets those are the two big buckets  and they are leveraging by getting on the network of the company moving laterally find high value assets and going after that so zero trust architecture is being clearly looked at as the primary solution for it the reason zero zalar growth is happening is because companies are embracing zero trust architecture that we pioneered you talked about china just now the big threat from china is that all large companies who are present in china  they have a network coming from china all the way to the us or europe bad guys can get on the network in china  travel and try to infect stuff out there we allow you not to have a network connected to china or other countries and still have secure communication those are the type of things enterprises and fed government organisations need to do to secure themselves and jay  of course  um  this is an election year not only in the us we just had an election in mexico we just had an election in india  and i know that when you re talking about breaches or insecure communications  that s a very different issue than misinformation and disinformation but i m just curious what you are seeing if anything sort of linked to geopolitics around the globe so we do track it though it s not our primary focus we are seeing uptake of this information uh uh we have a research team that actually tries to figure out what content is generated by gen  a  i and what what content is created by people it s fascinating to see you can actually tell the difference and we re seeing a lot more content that s being put out put out there that gen a  i is creating so all of us have to need need to worry about it jay  i wanna talk to you on on competition real quickly and specifically microsoft  uh  moving into your world you know  i  i was checking with an analyst  jay  who covers  uh  the company and he was saying  listen  that that is  in his opinion  creating some noise in the market and on the street um  what are you seeing  jay well  large companies like microsoft  they want to expand in all areas  right so i m not surprised that they re trying to expand in our area they have had overlapping products for a while microsoft windows has vpn built in for a long  long time but when i talk to large enterprises  they asked for two things number one  they said i want a security provider like a switzerland who can equally support my security to access office 365 azure aws  gcp and scores of sas applications we are in a better position to do that than an application provider like microsoft number two with all the issue you re seeing out there with midnight blizzard i m sure you saw the report that came from federal government about some of those issues more and more customers want application provider to be different from security provider separation of applications and security is a better thing you don t want a fox was the henhouse jay we always appreciate you coming on the show thank you josh and julie  thank you for the opportunity hope to talk to you again there was another strong quarter for costco same store sales increased the most in five quarters as consumers continue to look for value in groceries  and the retailer also said more members are purchasing more discretionary at a time where inflation remains sticky for a deeper dive into the costco results we re joined oliver chen td cowan  senior research analyst  here all right  is that is that a kirkland uh  wait a minute that is a costco sweater crew neck sweater my goodness ok  man dresses the part stays with the time here  oliver i mean  just take us into your thesis here brad  we re really excited about the results at costco costco is a really unique company as you know  that focuses on value it s one of our big ideas they ll be at our conference next week but what s really happening is continued graphic momentum  which is quite positive renewal rates at 93  which is quite high  and customers are looking for value this is costco s core competency the kirkland brand is also famous for offering outstanding value across the portfolio that s about 30  of the business so overall  um  we we are impressed with these strong results and  as you know  the consumer is facing many cross currents you mentioned in your comments that costco is seeing some benefits from non food product that s a huge positive  too  because we re not yet seeing that at other retailers such as target so as inflation starts to cool a bit  uh  costco is an early sign of this  and this company is benefiting a new cfo as well oliver  when it comes to  i m curious to your take on the stock reaction here  with it being off 2  it looks like a strong quarter is that just reflective of current valuation the fact that we close at an all time high heading into this print yes  that s true the pe multiples at 45 times the three year average  is closer to 35 and walmart s at 22 times so as we think about costco s valuation  it s expensive but in our opinion  it s worth it it s a different kind of retailer and that it s a membership model and about half of the profitability is membership so that s very sticky and recurring and also this is one of the few retailers that s a us retailer that s very global unit growth in asia and china is also impressive so  oliver  what do you think that upside  then looks like shirts are already up over 20  since the start of the year yeah  we re excited about this because it s a defensive name in terms of the food exposure and this real core competency for value but there s also a technology angle here  too  in terms of costco s personalization  their mobile app  their partnerships with instacart and uber and the marketplace model as well as digital advertising so a lot can be ahead  and costco has a very loyal  engaged customer also  you can t get any prices lower than what you can get at costco  given that the business model is set around 11  markups  and it s very strict so you re getting the best deal possible on this sweatshirt as well as this jewellery and the food and it s also a treasure hunt um  the future of retail is about these in store treasure hunts  and that s what you really need to captivate customers to get in store as well wait  the chains are from costco to oliver yeah  they are a top jewellery seller they re actually one of the top diamond sellers so you know  this company really surprises and delights and when you go into a costco  as you know  you find things you never knew you needed or wanted and that s part of the magic of costco i think we re witnessing pete oliver trend right now oliver  i think you re in your zone you re in your element you feel you look comfortable you look good at the end of the day  you think about where costco sits among the broader universe that you cover right now how do you look at them versus some of the competition yeah  what we see is bifurcation so brad costco s household income on our survey data is much higher than walmart or target or sam s club um  that s a big benefit and as you know  i do cover a wide range of stocks but we like very  uh  strong luxury stocks  uh  such as lv mh and then we look for value stocks such as walmart  which is offering a very exceptional value to customers costco is a offering exceptional value to customers  but it also has a higher household income customer and there s a technology personalization opportunity  too so it fits a lot of boxes in terms of our themes um  the bottom line is that we are in this consumer environment that s somewhat bumpy and cautious  and inflation is still bothering consumers so everybody s looking for low prices  and costco squarely fits in here as well as this merchandise execution  which is really to to what costco does the other point is  costco only has about 3500 items walmart has 200 000 plus so costco can be very agile and how they manage these items and also deliver a lot of expertise and precision in terms of a great item at a great price  such as this chain  such as a sweater such as a lot of the liquor it s great all right  oliver chen  you sold us td cowan  senior research analyst thanks so much for joining us here again costco shares sea quarter  but the stock under a bit of pressure here  off just about 2  in early trading let s take a look at dell those shares they re actually plunging after its gross margins fell 2 5  during the first quarter a surging demand for its a i servers took a toll dell shares  though still up over 100 and 20  so far this year so  yes  the massive decline that we re seeing at the open that clearly is catching investors  attention it off just around 18  but you gotta remember that this is a stock that has been off to the races since the start of the year and taking a look inside this quarter some of the concerns  obviously very lofty expectations you can see by the results or by the reaction that we re getting here in the street they weren t satisfied here with these numbers when it comes to what exactly we heard here  sales did increase 6 3  to 22 2 billion here for the quarter when you take a look at profit excluding items  that was a dollar 27 to share  compared to the average projection of just around a dollar 23 but again  we re looking at losses here at the open  with shares off just about 17  yeah  some hit on operating income that was down by about 14  during the quarter uh  no doubt they were paying close attention to that investors paying close attention to that and then i was looking at one other element of the business here uh  where was the operating income within isg infrastructure solutions group here and so  uh  kind of  uh  a larger question mark of within the continued expansion or kind of focusing in on a i optimising  uh  a i optimisation here across their business units and their segments where companies like dell  like some of the others over the course of this earning season  have said that they need to spend more in order to continue to make more or capitalise more on a run rate that they are forecasting at this juncture so  um  hopefully some continued updates on that front and by donna saying  i think summarising it pretty well here results weren t bad  but expectations were very high in these numbers just simply were not strong enough to stop a further near term or strong enough to spur further near term upside  and as a result  you re seeing the shares off just about 17  ',

                        "Two months ago, Bloomberg put SpaceX in its gunsights: Contrary to CEO Elon Musk's boasts, argued the news agency, claims that the company's Starlink satellite internet subsidiary is already profitable seem \"suspect.\" Citing \"persons familiar\" with SpaceX's finances, Bloomberg argued that SpaceX is losing \"hundreds\" of dollars on every Starlink ground terminal it sells.Bloomberg might even be right about that one part of Starlink's business, but it doesn't matter.Razors and blades... and profitsEvery ground terminal Starlink sells is analogous to a razor -- a piece of equipment that needs to be put in a customer's hands to then sell them blades (or satellite internet service, in the Starlink context) for years after making that first, unprofitable sale.As it turns out, Starlink's internet service is very profitable indeed.In its 2024 forecast, Payload Research estimated that Starlink will record revenue of $6.8 billion this year, most of which will come from internet subscriptions. Internal SpaceX documents show that the company hopes to earn 60% operating profit margins on this revenue -- which sounds like a lot because it is. Still, ground-based ISPs such as Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA) and Verizon (NYSE: VZ) routinely earn operating profit margins of anywhere from 20% to 40% by offering similar services, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. SpaceX, facing less competition in the field of space-based internet service, can probably do better than that.But even if it doesn't, even an operating profit margin of just 20% to 40% would be none too shabby.From none too shabby to \"nothing short of mind-blowing\"Profits, of course, come in all shapes and sizes, from gross to operating to net, as one travels down the income statement and deals with the intricacies of generally accepted accounting principles. As an investor, I personally prefer to value my companies on the cash they generate after paying for all their capital investments, which we call free cash flow.From that perspective, one space investor is now on the record describing SpaceX's profits as \"nothing short of mind-blowing.\"Quoted on Ars Technica last month, research firm Quilty Analytics largely agreed with Payload Research on how much revenue Starlink will generate this year -- about $6.6 billion, up from basically zero four years ago. After deducting capital expenditures, Quilty estimated that SpaceX Starlink will generate on the order of $600 million in positive free cash flow this year.Story continuesAgain, up from zero four years ago. Mind-blowing indeed.What it means for investorsIf you're a Starlink user, you may not be too thrilled to learn that your money is what Starlink is using to generate all these profits for SpaceX. But if you're a space investor like me and looking forward to the day when SpaceX announces an initial public offering of Starlink -- as Elon Musk has promised to do -- then you might be curious to learn what these numbers mean for Starlink as an investment.$600 million in free cash flow on $6.6 billion (or $6.8 billion) in annual revenue works out to roughly a 9% free cash flow margin on the Starlink business. To put that in context, Verizon generated $20.1 billion in positive free cash flow over the past year. On $134 billion in revenue, that worked out to a 15% free cash flow margin. Comcast's less profitable, but even its $16.7 billion in FCF on $153.3 billion in revenue yielded an 11% free cash flow margin.At first glance, these numbers may seem surprising. After all, Elon Musk is supposed to be \"magic\" for corporate profits -- but these numbers strongly suggest that his Starlink subsidiary is, in fact, significantly less profitable than established competitors like Comcast and Verizon. Still, remember that just four years ago, there wasn't even a Starlink around to compete with these earthbound ISPs.At $6.6 billion (or $6.8 billion) in revenue, Starlink may still be a long way away from the 60% profit margins on $30 billion in annual revenue that Musk is targeting. However, the bigger Starlink gets, and the more its efficiencies of scale increase, the more profitable this SpaceX subsidiary will become.I'm still as optimistic as ever about the coming Starlink IPO.Should you invest $1,000 in Comcast right now?Before you buy stock in Comcast, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Comcast wasn’t one of them.

                        "Warren Buffett still lives in the house he bought 66 years ago. Walmart founder Sam Walton drove a pickup truck instead of an expensive luxury car. Wipro founder Azim Premji often flies in economy class.Not every super-wealthy person foregoes spending lavishly. However, many of the richest individuals on the planet like to get a good value for their money. This sometimes shows up in their investing activity. Billionaires are buying these three undervalued stocks. Should you?1. Alibaba Group HoldingDavid Tepper's net worth is $20.6 billion. The hedge fund he founded in 1993, Appaloosa Management, now primarily manages Tepper's own money. Tepper and Appaloosa have bet heavily on one undervalued stock -- Alibaba Group Holding (NYSE: BABA).Alibaba ranks as Appaloosa's top holding. In the first quarter of 2024, Tepper upped his hedge fund's position in the Chinese tech company by nearly 159%. And he's not the only billionaire investor scooping up more shares of Alibaba.Ken Griffin is worth a whopping $37.5 billion. His hedge fund, Citadel, increased its stake in Alibaba by almost 27% in Q1.Why are these billionaires buying Alibaba hand over fist? The stock's valuation is almost certainly a key factor. Alibaba trades at a forward earnings multiple of slightly over 9.5. That's dirt cheap for a tech stock.2. PayPal HoldingsTepper doesn't own any shares of PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL). However, Griffin does. And he increased Citadel's position in the stock by nearly 182% in Q1.Another billionaire investor also developed a newfound interest in PayPal. Paul Tudor Jones, II, whose net worth is $8.1 billion, initiated a new position in the fintech company in Q1 for his Tudor Investment Holdings hedge fund.PayPal stock is down nearly 80% below its high set in mid-2021. Its shares trade at only 15 times forward earnings, much lower than the S&P 500 index's forward earnings multiple of 21.2.3. Verizon CommunicationsBillionaire Dan Loeb's Third Point hedge fund has a sizable position in Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ) but hasn't added to its stake recently. It's a different story for Griffin and his Citadel fund, though. Citadel bought more than 6.2 million shares of Verizon in Q1, boosting its stake in the telecom giant by nearly 254%.Verizon's share price remains well below its late 2019 peak. However, the stock has performed well over the last 12 months, jumping more than 20%. Roughly half of that gain came this year.I suspect Griffin was attracted in part by Verizon's valuation. Its shares trade at roughly 9 times forward earnings. That's less than half the forward earnings multiple of the S&P 500 communications services sector.Story continuesShould you buy these undervalued stocks, too?Investors who aren't billionaires could find much to like with these three stocks. However, they're not ideal picks for every investing style.Alibaba, PayPal, and Verizon might appeal to value investors. Growth investors could be intrigued by PayPal's prospects but probably won't be overly excited about Alibaba and Verizon.Income investors won't waste their time on PayPal since the company doesn't offer a dividend. They could also turn up their noses at Alibaba, which has a low forward dividend yield of under 1.3%. On the other hand, income investors should love Verizon with its ultra-high forward dividend yield of over 6.4%.Should you invest $1,000 in Alibaba Group right now?Before you buy stock in Alibaba Group, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alibaba Group wasn’t one of them.

                        "Nvidia completed a 10-for-1 stock split after the market closed on Friday, June 7. That split follows substantial price appreciation driven by enthusiasm surrounding artificial intelligence (AI). Nvidia shares are up more than 200% in the past year.Yet, several billionaire hedge fund managers trimmed their positions in Nvidia during the first quarter, before the stock split was announced, and reinvested the money in other AI companies.Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management sold 2.9 million shares of Nvidia, reducing his stake by 68%. Meanwhile, he increased his position in Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) by 155%, making it the ninth-largest holding in his portfolio.Steven Schonfeld of Schonfeld Strategic Advisors sold 96,793 shares of Nvidia, reducing his stake by 58%. Meanwhile, he increased his stake in Alphabet by 195%, making it the ninth-largest holding in his portfolio, excluding options contracts.Paul Tudor Jones of Tudor Investment sold 103,337 shares of Nvidia, reducing his stake by 78%. As a caveat, Jones purchased call options on Nvidia, which allow him to benefit from a price increase with a smaller capital outlay. Meanwhile, he increased his stake in Snowflake (NYSE: SNOW) by 54%, though it remains a relatively small position.Louis Bacon of Moore Capital Management sold 2,006 shares of Nvidia, reducing his stake by 19%. He also started positions in Alphabet and Snowflake, though neither rank among the top 25 holdings.The trades made by those hedge fund managers do not mean Nvidia is a bad investment. All four fund managers still have exposure to the chipmaker, as do plenty of other wealthy investors. However, Alphabet and Snowflake warrant further consideration.1. AlphabetAlphabet is the largest ad tech company and the third-largest cloud infrastructure and platform services provider in the world. Its leadership in advertising is predicated on its ability to engage internet users and collect data with popular web platforms, such as Google Search, YouTube, and Chrome. Similarly, its strong presence in cloud computing reflects its technological prowess and extensive data center footprint.Alphabet is slowly losing ground in digital advertising. Its market share is projected to slip to 27.4% this year, down from 28.1% last year. But Google Cloud Platform is actually gaining market share in cloud infrastructure and platform services, accounting for 11% of spending in the fourth quarter, up from 10% in the prior year.Alphabet is integrating its latest AI model, Gemini, into both ecosystems to boost growth. For instance, Gemini powers AI overviews designed to make Google Search more engaging and streamlines ad campaign creation with a conversational interface. Gemini also automates tasks in Workspace applications, like Google Docs and Google Sheets, and it can be fine-tuned by Google Cloud customers to create custom generative AI applications.Story continuesAlphabet is particularly well positioned to monetize AI through its cloud computing business. Forrester Research recently ranked Google Cloud Platform as the leader in AI infrastructure solutions, awarding the company the highest scores in current offering, development strategy, and market share. Forrester also ranked Google's Gemini as the leading large language model, ahead of OpenAI's GPT-4.Alphabet reported encouraging financial results in the first quarter. Revenue increased 15% to $80.5 billion due to strong momentum in cloud computing and modest growth in advertising. Meanwhile, generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) net income jumped 57% to $23.7 billion, helped along by cost-optimization efforts, like headcount reductions and the integration of different business teams.Going forward, Wall Street analysts estimate that Alphabet will grow earnings per share at 17.2% annually over the next three to five years. That forecast makes its current valuation of 26.7 times earnings seem reasonable. From that price, I think Alphabet can outperform the S&P 500 over the next three to five years.2. SnowflakeSnowflake is best known as a cloud data warehouse, a system that stores data optimized for queries and business intelligence. In fact, Forrester recently recognized the company as a leader among cloud data warehousing platforms. But Snowflake also functions as a data lake, a system that stores raw data for analytics and AI, and its platform supports data sharing.Beyond that core functionality, Snowflake provides several adjacent solutions. Its Snowpark developer framework supports the training of AI models, its Cortex service brings generative AI and machine learning models to Snowflake data, and its Native Application Framework allows businesses to build and deploy applications on the platform. Snowflake is unique in its ability to support those features on a single platform across multiple public clouds.The company reported mixed first-quarter financial results. Its customer count jumped 21% to 9,822, and the average existing customer spent 28% more. In turn, revenue increased 33% to $829 million on strong growth in core storage and analytics capabilities. But management also mentioned encouraging momentum with newer products. More than half of customers now use Snowpark, and over 750 customers have already used Cortex (which launched in May).The bottom line was more troubling. Non-GAAP operating margin contracted one percentage point in the first quarter, and non-GAAP net income declined 7% to $0.14 per diluted share. Snowflake also lowered its full-year margin guidance, but management attributed that to increased costs related to AI product development. CFO Michael Scarpelli told analysts, \"We view these investments as key to unlocking additional revenue opportunities in the future.\"Going forward, the data lake and data warehousing markets are projected to expand at 24% annually through 2030. Meanwhile, Wall Street expects Snowflake to grow sales at 23% annually over the next three years. Personally, I think that leaves room for upside if Snowflake is successful in its AI ambitions. But even if Wall Street is correct, the current valuation of 14.4 times sales is quite reasonable. Indeed, Snowflake has never traded at a cheaper valuation.Should you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

                        "If you're looking for stocks that can do well over the long term, a smart idea is to identify past winners. Absent any major industry- or company-specific changes, it's reasonable to expect these businesses to continue rewarding their shareholders in the future.For investors who focus on the auto industry, Ford (NYSE: F) might be on your radar, particularly as it trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of just 12.3. Unfortunately, its stock has disappointed, producing a total return of only 20% in the past decade. The S&P 500 would've more than tripled your money during the same time.This abysmal performance gives me zero confidence that Ford can produce market-beating returns in the years ahead. Therefore, it's a business I'm not touching with a 10-foot pole.Easy to be bearishBy taking a closer look at Ford under the hood, investors won't struggle to find things they dislike. One of these factors relates to its muted growth prospects. In the past 10 years, from 2013 to 2023, Ford's sales increased at a compound annual rate of only 1.8%. Global gross domestic product (GDP), which measures the growth of the overall economy, has risen at a faster yearly clip. The fact that Ford can't keep up with this is a troubling sign.This unfavorable situation also points to the maturity of the auto industry. According to the International Energy Agency, there were 74.8 million passenger vehicles sold worldwide in 2022, barely higher than the 73.8 million sold in 2012. This doesn't provide a healthy backdrop for Ford to post outsized gains.Moreover, profitability has never been anything to write home about. Ford's 2023 operating margin of 3% is lower than it was in 2013. Ford's operations are capital-intensive, so it must always spend heavily on its labor force, research and development, manufacturing capabilities, and marketing efforts. This doesn't give me much reason to be optimistic that the bottom line will improve. External factorsWhat makes investing in auto manufacturers especially troubling is just how exposed they are to variables outside their control. The status of global supply chains or labor relations can negatively impact the sector. Additionally, changes in interest rates or inflation can pressure consumer spending habits, reducing demand for new vehicle purchases.Even Tesla, the historically fast-growing and now profitable electric-vehicle (EV) leader, is starting to realize that it can't escape the issues that plague being a carmaker. The company's sales and margins are taking a hit in the current environment.Story continuesTesla's edge, however, is that it possesses an economic moat. It has a strong brand, which has generally allowed it to charge premium prices, compared to its rivals. And its focus on bolstering its EV manufacturing has resulted in cost advantages when producing cars.It's hard to argue that Ford has an economic moat of its own. The brand has been around since 1903, but there are numerous larger traditional car companies that are also competing on all the same factors, whether that's design, pricing, product features, or maintenance and repair requirements. Because Ford's profitability hasn't improved over the years, there doesn't seem to be any benefit from scale.No matter how reasonably valued the stock looks or how hefty the current 5% dividend yield is, I don't see Ford producing returns that will come close to matching the broader S&P 500 in the long run. And that's why I won't touch it with a 10-foot pole.Should you invest $1,000 in Ford Motor Company right now?Before you buy stock in Ford Motor Company, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Ford Motor Company wasn’t one of them.

                        "For several years, Zscaler (NASDAQ: ZS) was one of the market's hottest cybersecurity stocks. It went public at $16 per share on March 16, 2018, and eventually soared to an all-time high of $368.78 on Nov. 19, 2021. But today, it trades at about $175.Like many other hypergrowth stocks, Zscaler lost its luster as its sales growth cooled off and rising rates compressed its valuations. But will its stock finally stabilize and perhaps even rally over the next 12 months?Image source: Getty Images.How fast is Zscaler growing?Zscaler develops \"zero trust\" services that treat everyone, including a company's CEO, as a potential threat. Those tight security controls can shield an organization from remote hackers, disgruntled employees, and corporate spies.The company provides its tools as cloud-based services that don't require any on-site appliances. That lightweight approach is cheaper, easier to scale, and doesn't require any on-site maintenance. It also locks its customers into sticky subscriptions.That innovative approach enabled Zscaler to grow like a weed after its public debut. From fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2023 (which ended last July), the company's calculated billings grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 51% as its revenue rose at a CAGR of 53%. But over the past year, its top-line growth decelerated as it struggled to gain new customers and lock in higher-value contracts in a tougher macro environment.MetricQ3 2023Q4 2023Q1 2024Q2 2024Q3 2024Calculated billings growth (YOY)40%38%34%27%30%Revenue growth (YOY)46%43%40%35%32%Data source: Zscaler. YOY = year over year.For the full year, Zscaler expects its calculated billings and revenue to rise 28% and 32%, respectively. It's gradually raised its annual guidance over the past three quarters. For fiscal 2025, analysts expect its revenue to grow 23%.Zscaler's growth is cooling off, but its margins are also rising. In the first nine months of 2024, adjusted gross margin held steady year over year at 81% as adjusted operating margin expanded 7 percentage points to 20%. It attributed that expansion to tighter cost controls and a longer depreciable life cycle for its current cloud infrastructure.The company expects adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to grow 67%-68% for the full year, which exceeds analysts' expectations for 64% growth. But in fiscal 2025, analysts only expect 13% growth as the company laps its cloud life-cycle benefits and ramps up its investments again.Why did Zscaler's stock slump this year?Zscaler is still growing as it gains more enterprise and government contracts, but it has two glaring weaknesses. First, it's stayed unprofitable on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis ever since its initial public offering (IPO), and analysts don't expect it to turn a profit until fiscal 2026. Other cybersecurity leaders like CrowdStrike and Palo Alto Networks -- which both bundle zero trust tools with their other services -- are already generating stable GAAP profits.Story continuesSecond, Zscaler's stock isn't a bargain at 52x its forward adjusted earnings and 10x next year's sales. It's not as overvalued as it was during the meme-stock rally in late 2021, but its upside potential might be limited at these levels.As long as interest rates stay high and Zscaler's revenue growth continues to decelerate, investors will probably avoid this stock. That may be why the stock tumbled more than 20% year to date and insiders sold nearly 10x as many shares as they bought over the past 12 months.Where will Zscaler's stock be in a year?Zscaler is a resilient cybersecurity company that dominates a high-growth niche, but I believe its stock will trade sideways or slip lower over the next 12 months. The market needs to revalue it as a growth stock instead of a hypergrowth one, but that process will likely compress its valuations and weigh down its stock price.Should you invest $1,000 in Zscaler right now?Before you buy stock in Zscaler, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Zscaler wasn’t one of them.

                        "Software-based robotics and automation platform UiPath (NYSE: PATH) just got clobbered. Investors have been neutral over its last two years navigating the bear market with a new CEO (which was initially a co-CEO situation with one of the co-founders).But the bear market is over, and new methods of artificial intelligence (AI) have investors suddenly displeased with UiPath -- or at least highly uncertain of what comes next. The stock fell nearly 35% immediately following the fiscal 2025 first-quarter update (for the three months ended April 30).UiPath hasn't been the only software business to take it on the chin. The game has changed, and companies need to spend to keep pace with the rapid innovation Nvidia has helped unlock. Is it time to buy the dip on UiPath stock?Last quarter was good, but that's not the problemAfter two years leading UiPath, Rob Enslin is out as CEO. Co-founder Daniel Dines (who stepped into the full-time role of chief innovation officer at the start of 2024) is back in as the chief executive.It seems pretty clear things have dramatically changed for UiPath. Enslin was brought in to help get UiPath to profitability (on an adjusted earnings and free-cash-flow basis), and a share repurchase program was announced under his watch ($22 million worth of stock was bought back last quarter). But with Dines taking over, this seems to signal UiPath now sees innovation once again as more important than profitability, at least for the time being.The recently revised trajectory for the company's financials are proof of this shift. Fiscal Q1 revenue increased 16% year over year to $335 million, at the high end of guidance provided three months ago. Adjusted operating income was $50 million, a bit shy of the $55 million management had forecast.The problem, though, is the full-year outlook just got a sizable downgrade. At the outset of fiscal 2025, management guided for revenue of $1.555 billion to $1.560 billion. With the recent earnings release, UiPath revised its outlook downward to $1.405 billion to $1.410 billion, a nearly 10% reduction from the previous high end of guidance. Annualized recurring revenue (or ARR, an important growth metric for software-as-a-service companies) is expected to be up just 14% year over year at the end of fiscal 2025 (which wraps up Jan. 2025).Perhaps even worse, as UiPath's revenue slows, profit margins are now going in reverse. Previously, adjusted operating income was expected to be about $295 million, implying an adjusted operating margin of about 19%. Three months later, expected adjusted operating income for fiscal 2025 has been shaved down to just $145 million, or a margin of just 10%.Story continuesDon't all \"AI stocks\" only go up?Though UiPath's software helps customers automate redundant tasks for employees (like data collection or filling out forms), not all AI is trending in this current economic environment.Massive amounts of corporate budgets have pivoted toward investing in Nvidia's accelerated computing systems. And along with those systems, Nvidia offers plenty of algorithms that help its customers build their own custom AI applications. Suddenly, out-of-the-box ready-to-use subscription software isn't so en vogue.Now, this isn't to say UiPath's software is being ditched. Remember, ARR should still rise this year. But growth is slowing, so it's clear UiPath's share of new corporate spending isn't what it used to be.Slowing revenue and decreasing profitability is exactly what investors don't want to see right now. If a company like UiPath reports slowing revenue growth, as is the norm as a business gets larger, that's fine. But there should be an accompanying increase in profit margins as the business matures.

                        'software based robotics and automation platform uipath  nyse  path  just got clobbered  investors have been neutral over its last two years navigating the bear market with a new ceo  which was initially a co ceo situation with one of the co founders  but the bear market is over  and new methods of artificial intelligence  ai  have investors suddenly displeased with uipath    or at least highly uncertain of what comes next  the stock fell nearly 35  immediately following the fiscal 2025 first quarter update  for the three months ended april 30  uipath hasn t been the only software business to take it on the chin  the game has changed  and companies need to spend to keep pace with the rapid innovation nvidia has helped unlock  is it time to buy the dip on uipath stock last quarter was good  but that s not the problemafter two years leading uipath  rob enslin is out as ceo  co founder daniel dines  who stepped into the full time role of chief innovation officer at the start of 2024  is back in as the chief executive it seems pretty clear things have dramatically changed for uipath  enslin was brought in to help get uipath to profitability  on an adjusted earnings and free cash flow basis   and a share repurchase program was announced under his watch   22 million worth of stock was bought back last quarter   but with dines taking over  this seems to signal uipath now sees innovation once again as more important than profitability  at least for the time being the recently revised trajectory for the company s financials are proof of this shift  fiscal q1 revenue increased 16  year over year to  335 million  at the high end of guidance provided three months ago  adjusted operating income was  50 million  a bit shy of the  55 million management had forecast the problem  though  is the full year outlook just got a sizable downgrade  at the outset of fiscal 2025  management guided for revenue of  1 555 billion to  1 560 billion  with the recent earnings release  uipath revised its outlook downward to  1 405 billion to  1 410 billion  a nearly 10  reduction from the previous high end of guidance  annualized recurring revenue  or arr  an important growth metric for software as a service companies  is expected to be up just 14  year over year at the end of fiscal 2025  which wraps up jan  2025  perhaps even worse  as uipath s revenue slows  profit margins are now going in reverse  previously  adjusted operating income was expected to be about  295 million  implying an adjusted operating margin of about 19   three months later  expected adjusted operating income for fiscal 2025 has been shaved down to just  145 million  or a margin of just 10  story continuesdon t all  ai stocks  only go up though uipath s software helps customers automate redundant tasks for employees  like data collection or filling out forms   not all ai is trending in this current economic environment massive amounts of corporate budgets have pivoted toward investing in nvidia s accelerated computing systems  and along with those systems  nvidia offers plenty of algorithms that help its customers build their own custom ai applications  suddenly  out of the box ready to use subscription software isn t so en vogue now  this isn t to say uipath s software is being ditched  remember  arr should still rise this year  but growth is slowing  so it s clear uipath s share of new corporate spending isn t what it used to be slowing revenue and decreasing profitability is exactly what investors don t want to see right now  if a company like uipath reports slowing revenue growth  as is the norm as a business gets larger  that s fine  but there should be an accompanying increase in profit margins as the business matures  margins suddenly contracting is an indicator that competitive forces  in this case  nvidia and lots of new software providers building atop nvidia s platform  are eroding uipath s business a few

                        "If you are looking for an energy stock in June, you have plenty of options. But the big question you need to ask yourself is, \"How much exposure to commodities do I want?\" That will change the stock you pick in a very material way.Here are three options across a broad spectrum, from virtually no exposure in Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE: EPD) to Chevron's (NYSE: CVX) diversified energy portfolio to Occidental Petroleum's (NYSE: OXY) more aggressive investment in oil and gas.Enterprise is a high yield energy puntThe biggest risk when it comes to buying an energy stock is going to be the highly variable prices of oil and natural gas. You don't have to avoid the sector if you don't want to take on this risk -- you just have to focus on the midstream space.This is where Enterprise Products Partners plays, helping to move oil, natural gas, and related products into which they get turned around the world. It owns pipeline, storage, and transportation infrastructure.What's most important, however, is that Enterprise charges fees for the use of its assets. The price of the commodities it transports is less important than demand for energy, which tends to remain robust even when oil prices are falling. So Enterprise tends to have very reliable cash flows to cover its generous 7.2% or so distribution yield.The distribution has been increased annually for a quarter of a century, and it is covered 1.7 times over by distributable cash flow. If you are looking for a rock-solid income investment in the energy space, Enterprise should be on your wish list in June.Chevron is built to ride the cycleIf you want to take on some commodity risk, but not too much, then the next best option in June is probably Chevron.Chevron is an integrated energy giant, with a global portfolio of assets that spans from the upstream (drilling) through the midstream (pipelines) all the way to the downstream (chemicals and refining). This diversification helps to soften the peaks and valleys of the energy cycle, since each segment tends to perform differently through the cycle. For example, downstream operations often benefit from the low energy prices that hamper upstream operations.But the bigger story here is probably Chevron's balance sheet, which is the strongest among its closest peer group. That means it has more leeway to take on the debt it needs to fund both its operations and its dividend when energy prices are low.Notably, the dividend has been increased annually for a huge 37 years and counting. Right now is an interesting time to consider Chevron because its shares are being weighed down by Wall Street's concerns about its merger with Hess, which may get scuttled. That has left Chevron with a 4% yield, notably higher than similarly situated competitor ExxonMobil, which has a 3.2% yield.Story continuesOccidental Petroleum has been aggressiveThe last option investors looking at the energy sector might want to consider is Occidental Petroleum, one of the stocks that Warren Buffett owns. Occidental's story is a bit different, however, because the company is far more aggressive than both Chevron and Enterprise.The growth efforts Oxy has undertaken have been a bit of a mixed bag. A big acquisition that it stole out from under Chevron left Oxy with a huge debt load just as oil prices started to tank early in the decade. A dividend cut and poor stock performance were the outcome.However, Occidental has taken its lumps in stride. It has reduced leverage, started increasing the dividend again, and even undertaken additional acquisitions. The dividend yield today is just 1.4%, but that's not really why you are buying the stock. Simply put, Occidental is an energy stock that's focused on growing its business.To be fair, production was lower year over year in the first quarter, even though it was in-line with guidance. But one quarter doesn't make a trend -- the goal here is to become a major player that can run with giants like Chevron and Exxon.Still, that brings with it risks and, given the outsized impact of its upstream operation relative to its midstream and downstream divisions, more exposure to volatile commodity prices. If the extra exposure to energy prices sounds good to you, then you might like Oxy.You have options in the energy patchThe energy sector is not for the faint of heart, given the huge impact that volatile energy prices can have on the financial performance of energy stocks. But that doesn't mean you have to avoid the sector.Enterprise lets you benefit from energy demand without the commodity risk and rewards you with a high yield. Chevron provides a more balanced exposure to the energy sector and has a relatively high yield today compared to its closest peer. And Oxy has been working to grow its business so it can increasingly compete with larger players like Chevron. It has more execution risk and energy exposure, for those with a more aggressive bent.Should you invest $1,000 in Occidental Petroleum right now?Before you buy stock in Occidental Petroleum, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Occidental Petroleum wasn’t one of them.

                        "The artificial intelligence (AI) hype has been on overdrive for the past 18 months. While AI has been around for years, recent advances in the technology mean AI is still very much in its infancy in terms of investment potential.Investors should expect plenty more changes over the coming years with some companies moving up into the limelight while others fizzle out, unable to keep pace with competition. That leaves many investors interested in this sector wondering how to pinpoint the winning AI stocks that will remain winners long-term.Exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which are buckets of individual stocks that trade under one ticker symbol, could be the answer. The diversification they offer means you don't have to pick specific winners, which benefits investors looking to capture the upside of artificial intelligence (AI).Here are two AI-related ETFs that you can comfortably buy and hold for decades.A broad gem with a proven track recordThe Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ: QQQ) doesn't market itself as an AI-dedicated fund, but its \"DNA\" could make it the most dependable AI ETF money can buy. It tracks the Nasdaq-100. This index is technology-heavy; about 60% of its stocks come from the tech sector. The rest are primarily healthcare and consumer discretionary stocks.More importantly, the ETF's top holdings are already big-time players in AI. Names like Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, and Meta Platforms are in the top five, accounting for 26% of its total value. These big-tech companies are major players in AI-related fields like semiconductor chips (Nvidia), cloud computing (Microsoft and Amazon), and the metaverse (Meta Platforms). That's excellent AI exposure from companies that are already fundamentally rock-solid.The fund has already shown strong results; the Invesco QQQ easily outperformed the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite over the past decade:QQQ Total Return Price ChartThere's no guarantee that its outperformance will continue indefinitely, but betting on the biggest technology companies in the world has worked out well. Since these same companies are already at the forefront of the AI industry, it seems like a good idea to continue riding those horses for long-term growth.A more concentrated AI fund with a high potential upsideInvestors who are feeling a bit more adventurous might find an ETF that is specifically dedicated to AI appealing. The Roundhill Generative AI & Technology ETF (NYSEMKT: CHAT), launched in May 2023, aims to provide long-term outperformance by focusing heavily on generative AI and its growth potential. The big difference between this ETF and the Invesco QQQ is that it doesn't track an index. The fund managers of the Roundhill Generative AI & Technology ETF actively buy and sell positions regularly.Story continuesThe potential benefit of an actively managed fund is that smart investment decisions can pay off with massive returns. Right now, the fund managers are bullish on Nvidia (the ETF's most significant position, at over 14%) and Microsoft (its second largest, at more than 10%). The fund currently has 50 holdings. The risk is that bad decisions by those managers can sap investors' returns.So far, the Roundhill Generative AI & Technology ETF has performed well, outperforming the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite since its inception:CHAT Total Return Price ChartActively managed ETFs often charge higher fees than passively managed funds. The expense ratio for this one is 0.75%, significantly higher than the Invesco QQQ's 0.2%. That fee effectively puts this ETF on par with the Nasdaq Composite in terms of performance (so far). Still, the high fee won't matter as much if the investment returns are high enough for long enough.Ultimately, either of these funds could benefit long-term investors. According to a forecast from PwC, the global economic impact of AI could be more than $15 trillion annually by 2030. In that scenario, investors who put money into the trend will likely make out very well, regardless of which of these funds they own.Should you invest $1,000 in Invesco QQQ Trust right now?Before you buy stock in Invesco QQQ Trust, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Invesco QQQ Trust wasn’t one of them.

                        '(Bloomberg) -- Elon Musk’s Neuralink Corp. livestreamed an update with its first brain implant patient Wednesday, showing a quadriplegic man who was able to play video games and online chess using his mind.Most Read from BloombergNeuralink is a brain technology startup founded by Musk. Its implant allows a patient to use their thoughts to control a computer. Musk has said that the company will start by working with patients who have severe physical limitations like cervical spinal cord impairment or quadriplegia.In the video on Wednesday, which was streamed on Musk’s social platform X, the patient, Noland Arbaugh, was able to use his computer to play chess and the game Civilization VI. “I had given up on playing that game,” he said.“It has already changed my life,” Arbaugh said. “The surgery was super easy.”Arbaugh, 29, said he sustained a spinal cord injury in a “freak diving accident” eight years ago. He also said he was released from the hospital a day after the Neuralink procedure in January, which went smoothly. He added that there was “still work to be done” to refine the technology.Neuralink is not the only company working on brain devices that connect with computers. Modern demonstrations of cursor control by using thoughts have taken place in other humans with various types of implants, such as those deployed by the BrainGate consortium of research institutions and hospitals.However, the Neuralink device contains more electrodes than other devices, suggesting it may have more potential applications in future. The Neuralink technology works without needing a wired connection to external devices.Musk hinted that the device may have the capability to restore vision. “Blindsight is the next product after Telepathy,” he wrote, in a post on X on Wednesday, referring to the name of the implant for paralyzed patients.Musk noted the Blindsight implant is already working in monkeys. “Resolution will be low at first, like early Nintendo graphics, but ultimately may exceed normal human vision,” Musk said in a post on X.According to a Facebook page for Arbaugh, which hasn’t been publicly updated since 2017, his accident took place at a children’s camp in June 2016. In 2017, he successfully raised $10,000 via a GoFundMe campaign to purchase an accessible custom-built van.“I’m happy for the individual that he’s been able to interface with a computer in a way he wasn’t able to before the implant,” said Kip Allan Ludwig, co-director of the Wisconsin Institute for Translational Neuroengineering. “That’s not a breakthrough compared to what others have shown previously, but it’s certainly a good starting point.”(Updates to add that the Blindsight implant is already working in monkeys)Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek©2024 Bloomberg L.P.',

                        "CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD) and Zscaler (NASDAQ: ZS) both recently posted strong quarterly reports that exceeded analysts' expectations on the top and bottom lines. Both cybersecurity stocks rallied after those earnings beats.But over the past 12 months, CrowdStrike's stock has soared more than 120%, while Zscaler's shares rose by less 20%. Let's see why the bulls were more drawn to CrowdStrike -- and whether that trend will continue for the foreseeable future.Image source: Getty Images.The similarities and differencesCrowdStrike and Zscaler are both cloud-native cybersecurity specialists that don't install any on-site appliances. That lightweight approach is cheaper, easier to scale, and doesn't require any on-site maintenance services. Both companies also lock their clients into sticky subscription plans.CrowdStrike's Falcon platform provides a broad range of endpoint security services that mainly counter external threats. Zscaler develops \"zero-trust\" services that treat everyone, including a company's top executives, as potential threats.CrowdStrike and Zscaler aren't direct competitors, but they have overlapping interests. CrowdStrike now offers its own zero-trust services, while Zscaler has been expanding its ecosystem with more security tools. Both companies have consistently kept their adjusted gross margin around 80%, so they still have plenty of pricing power in their respective markets.The duo has also grown rapidly since their IPOs. CrowdStrike went public in 2019, and its revenue increased at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 65% from fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2024 (which ended this January). Zscaler went public in 2018, and its revenue rose at a CAGR of 53% from fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2023 (which ended last July).The pair faces similar challengesCybersecurity companies are resistant to macro headwinds, since most businesses won't shut down their digital defenses to save a few dollars. But it can still become tougher to lock new customers into bigger and longer-term contracts.That's why CrowdStrike and Zscaler both grappled with slower growth over the past year. CrowdStrike expects its revenue to rise 28%-31% in fiscal 2025. Zscaler expects a 32% increase in revenue in fiscal 2024, while analysts anticipate a 23% boost in fiscal 2025. CrowdStrike's year-over-year revenue growth notably stabilized over the past two quarters, which implies it's passed its cyclical trough. Zscaler's revenue is still decelerating, and it expects its slowdown to deepen in its current quarter.Story continuesBut CrowdStrike has a few advantages versus ZscalerCrowdStrike and Zscaler might initially seem similar, but the profits tell a different story. CrowdStrike has stayed profitable on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis for five consecutive quarters, but analysts don't expect Zscaler to generate an annual profit on the same basis until fiscal 2026.On a non-GAAP basis, analysts expect CrowdStrike's EPS to rise 30% in fiscal 2025. They expect Zscaler's non-GAAP EPS to soar 64% in fiscal 2024 but only climb 13% in fiscal 2025 as it laps some cloud-related cost benefits and ramps up its investments again.CrowdStrike also maintains higher free cash flow (FCF) margins than Zscaler. In their latest quarters, CrowdStrike's FCF margin rose 2 percentage points year over year to 35%, while Zscaler's FCF margin grew 4 percentage points to 22%.CrowdStrike's insiders also seem more optimistic than Zscaler's. Over the past 12 months, CrowdStrike's insiders only sold about 28% more shares than they bought, while Zscaler's insiders sold nearly 10 times as many shares as they bought.Neither of these stocks is a bargainBoth of these stocks still sport premium valuations. CrowdStrike trades at 87 times its forward adjusted EPS, while Zscaler has a lower forward multiple of 52. Zscaler might seem cheaper, but it deserves its lower valuation because its revenue growth is less impressive, it isn't profitable yet, and it has a narrower moat. CrowdStrike's valuations are getting a bit frothy after its yearlong rally, but I believe it will continue to outperform Zscaler as long as it keeps exceeding Wall Street's estimates.Where to invest $1,000 right nowWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

                        "It's no secret that Warren Buffett likes dividend stocks. His Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) portfolio is chock-full of stocks with long histories of paying attractive dividends. All of Berkshire's top 12 holdings pay dividends.However, Buffett hasn't been known for investing in stocks with exceptionally high dividend yields. The Oracle of Omaha, though, does own two ultra-high-yield dividend stocks that are great picks for income investors right now.Buffett's \"secret\" ultra-high-yield dividend stocksWhat dividend yield qualifies as ultra-high? The definition I use is four times the yield of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust. Since the S&P 500 ETF's yield is currently 1.34%, the threshold for ultra-high yield is 5.36%.You won't find any ultra-high-yield dividend stocks in Berkshire Hathaway's latest 13F filing. But Berkshire owns several stocks with super-high yields in what you might call Buffett's \"secret\" portfolio.Berkshire acquired General Reinsurance in 1998. General Re had acquired New England Asset Management (NEAM) three years earlier. NEAM manages its own investment portfolio that's separate from Berkshire's portfolio. However, since NEAM is a wholly owned subsidiary of Berkshire, every stock it owns, Buffett and Berkshire also own.NEAM's portfolio includes several ultra-high-yield dividend stocks. I think two of them especially stand out: Ares Capital (NASDAQ: ARCC) and Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ). Ares Capital is the largest publicly traded business development company (BDC). Most investors are probably familiar with Verizon, which provides telecommunications services around the world.Great picks for income investorsWhy are Ares Capital and Verizon great picks for income investors? Let's start with their juicy dividends. Ares Capital's forward dividend yield tops 8.9%, while Verizon's forward dividend yield is over 6.4%.Both companies' dividend programs also have solid track records. Ares has 15 years of steady-to-growing dividends, with the highest regular dividend per share growth over the last 10 years among large BDCs. Verizon has increased its dividend payout for 17 consecutive years, the longest streak in the U.S. telecommunications industry.Ares and Verizon have been able to reward shareholders so consistently because they both have strong underlying businesses. Ares is the largest player in the growing U.S. direct lending market. The company is highly selective in the deals it makes, with a closing rate of around 5%. Verizon is a leader in providing wireless and broadband services for businesses and consumers.Story continuesWhile many stocks are priced for perfection with the bull market sustaining its momentum, Ares Capital and Verizon have attractive valuations. Ares' forward price-to-earnings ratio is below 9.2, compared to a multiple of 15.5 for the S&P 500 financial sector. Verizon's shares trade at a little over 9 times forward earnings. By comparison, the forward earnings multiple for the S&P 500 communication services sector is over 19.2.A few risksNo stock is perfect. Ares Capital and Verizon are no exceptions. Both stocks have a few risks.As a lender, Ares faces the possibility that its borrowers will default on their loans. This risk could increase if the U.S. economy experiences a major downturn. Capital markets can be highly volatile at times even when the economy doesn't falter.Verizon has intense competition in the telecom market. The company must invest heavily to deploy new technology such as 5G networks. Its growth could be derailed by an economic decline.However, both Ares and Verizon appear to be in great positions to continue paying and growing their dividends. There's arguably nothing more important for income investors.Should you invest $1,000 in Ares Capital right now?Before you buy stock in Ares Capital, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Ares Capital wasn’t one of them.
