                        "Shares of Tesla (TSLA) are trading higher following its shareholder meeting, which alluded to new offerings coming to market after the approval of Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package. Citi autos equity research analyst Itay Michaeli joins the Morning Brief to discuss why Tesla's product innovation is key to driving growth.Michaeli notes that there is \"a lot of anticipation for the next round of new products from Tesla.\" He explains that the company has mentioned introducing more affordable EV models, for which investors await two crucial factors: the price point and \"the overall design and content of these vehicles.\" The main concern for investors will be whether these new vehicles can \"generate the same type of hype\" seen with previous Tesla models. If so, Michaeli believes it could drive substantial growth in the company's share price.\"We want to see a lot of innovation, maybe different design languages. Really whatever it takes... to create a lot of incremental excitement,\" Michaeli told Yahoo Finance.Read more about what's next for Tesla here.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Morning Brief.Video TranscriptTesla shares moving to the upside here of nearly 1.5% after the EV giants shareholder meeting at that meeting.Musk predicted that Tesla's optimist robots could eventually lift the company's market cap to $25 trillion.One of the other catalysts that Wall Street is watching for deeper dive in a Tesla growth story.We are joined by the AM U Auto Parts and analyst here.Thank you so much for joining us here.I want to start on what you are anticipating based on what we heard from Musk specifically with regards to new product announcement.Sometimes it's tough to kind of suss out whether or not Musk's approach is necessarily going to prove to come to fruition.What did you make of the teasing out of certain new products to come at that meeting?Absolutely good morning and thank you for having me.Yeah, there is a lot of anticipation for the next round of new products from Tesla.Uh last quarter.They did allude to launching uh more affordable electric vehicles uh off some of the same platforms they have today and leveraging some of the manufacturing capacity they have today and launching these vehicles next year.There are really two things people are looking for in these vehicles.The first of course, is the price just given that evs do need to become more affordable and, and you know that there's some opportunity for growth uh at lower price points.But the second thing that we're particularly looking for is really just the overall design and content of these vehicles.Story continuesBecause the ultimate question, I think for investors is going to be that will these vehicles generate the same type of excitement we've seen for other high volume vehicles in the past, such as of course, the model three and the model Y if the answer to that question is yes, we do see scope for sentiment to improve as the focus would then turn to these new products driving additional growth uh versus which is really needed just given some of the demand uh headwinds that both electric vehicles of what we're seeing around the world that a Tesla specifically is, is facing given some of the aging out of their current portfolio.So to two follow up questions on that one, what do you think prices should be at or need to be at to really spark that demand?We've been talking a lot about lower prices, but I guess more specifically is there a range that you think is critical for Tesla to get to?And then two, when you talk about the Tesla story specifically and what these new products, what these new uh vehicles need to be equipped with in order to generate that excitement, what do you think needs to be incorporated in order to see uh that excitement play out in the market?There's a lot of, but whether it's in the interior of the vehicle or, or, or even others uh that, that could just create more of a change.Right?When you think about large car companies as they grow, there does need to be different design languages, even different sub brands in those vehicles to really appeal to a wider audience uh around around the world.Because when you look at different regional tastes and regional consumer preference that they tend to vary not only by, by country, but even within regions in certain countries, including here in the US.So, you know, we want to see a lot of innovation, maybe different design languages, but really whatever it takes.Of course, Tesla is very good at innovation and very good at product to create a lot of uh incremental excitement and and price points are are clearly important, but we've been on the view.Uh the price isn't Tesla's number one issue today, we would actually rank just the overall aging of the portfolio as being maybe a bigger issue for the company today than just price alone.So of course, we want to see 30 40,000 and eventually even lower than that.Of course, Tesla's had aspirations to launch a $25,000 ev of course, so we're mindful of the price points.Uh And of course, the price points relative to the content you're getting, it's all ultimately all about the value for dollars.Uh But we, we are focused overall on the content on the design, on the innovation um to really undersee whether you know, investors and consumers, of course, can get really excited about new vehicles.Uh that could be very high volume vehicles for the company.So it is a very uh significant focal point here over the next few months.It, I wonder if you can talk a little bit about the path to autonomous vehicles.And you sort of mentioned the varying global appetite for a variety of things coming from Tesla to what extent is the kind of bifurcation in interest in being in a full self driving vehicle across countries globally, sort of a potential headwind for Tesla moving forward.You know, it really all depends on, on kind of the different opportunities within how you think about launching autonomous vehicles.So we are very bullish on the opportunity within autonomous vehicles overall lower cost per mile and new business models and the opportunity not only to increase revenue streams, but even to grab revenue streams that exist in the value chain today and bring a kind of back up to that automaker ecosystem.I think autonomous vehicles tend to be um often defined as sort of one business model of the so called urban Robo taxi.But actually, there are a lot of different business models in theory that a company could launch Tesla has a couple of very unique advantages in our view.One being that we do think that they could probably launch perhaps the cheapest and lowest cost Robo taxi platform out there, not only from a hardware cost perspective, but also from an operating cost and network cost perspective.And if we're right about that, that could actually lead to potential new opportunities of how to deploy autonomous vehicles.For example, you might not need to deploy the most dense areas.You can actually maybe go to relatively easier areas and then maybe even launch some services on your current ecosystem of, of consumer vehicles and Robo taxi vehicles, things like peer to peer uh vehicle landing, things like uh you know, you order something at nine o'clock at night and the vehicle travels to, to get it for you at 2 a.m. Y 2 a.m. because you know, the safest autonomous vehicles aren't gonna be the one driving without any uh person in the vehicle.Uh I I in relative times where a few people are out on the road, uh and the vehicle can kind of bring you those items that you ordered uh in the morning.And so there's a lot of different ecosystem effects.So we think that you can create uh to sell more vehicles, create new revenue streams and ultimately try to supplement uh the consumer fleet with, with Robo Taxi because the number one, you know, factor we think they have to get right uh when they kind of weve that the Robo Taxi day uh is of course the cost and then the vehicle itself.But ultimately is how are you going to deploy autonomous vehicles in a way that's first and foremost, safe, but also can lead to additional revenue streams?Maybe people aren't really thinking about today.And before we let you go, if Tesla is in fact able to do all of that, what is the upside then look like for Tesla?Yeah, we're still neutral on the stock just given some year term, you know, fundamental headwinds we talked about uh I think our estimates are still actually below consensus.But if you can turn the story into a, the new evs we talked about and B if the company can craft a credible autonomous vehicle deployment plan that leverages their advantages, we think there is scope for sentiment to improve here in the next few months, it's gonna be a very important few months for them uh to kind of try to reshape the narrative given some of the near term headwinds that they're facing.",

                        'In mid-2020, an exasperated Elon Musk appealed for greater access to a commodity crucial to electric-vehicle battery production. “Any mining companies out there, please mine more nickel, okay?” he said on an earnings call. “Tesla will give you a giant contract for a long period of time if you mine nickel efficiently and in an environmentally sensitive way.”The Tesla CEO soon found a supplier that could fulfill at least part of his request. In 2022, the EV maker struck a $5 billion deal to source nickel from Indonesia. The Muslim-majority archipelago of 280 million people has a landmass three times the size of Texas, scattered across an island chain spanning a distance comparable to that between San Francisco and Bermuda in the mid-Atlantic. Buried beneath its mangroves, ancient rainforests, and active volcanoes is the world’s largest reserve of nickel: 42% of the global supply. The metallic element is a component crucial to rechargeable batteries—including those in EVs—and to the world’s overall green transition.As the EV sector has boomed, Indonesia’s government has sought to leverage this stockpile to jump-start its high-value manufacturing sector and stoke its economy. The strategy has already proved lucrative, but cashing in on the sought-after resource comes with challenges: Extracting it from the earth is a dirty, dangerous business. And sagging sales of EVs worldwide suggest that nickel, the resource one of the world’s richest men begged for a few years ago, may not be an easy pathway to prosperity.Ever since Dutch colonists first discovered nickel in Indonesia in the early 1900s, it’s been at the center of battles over who gets to mine and sell it. In the past decade, the Indonesian government has set out an ambitious development plan that would give it definitive control over nickel and other commodities.The government’s first step in capturing more of the nickel value chain was banning exports of the raw metal, which Indonesia first did in 2014. That means nickel isn’t just mined in Indonesia; it’s now refined in the country before it’s sent elsewhere. The result is clear: The value of Indonesia’s nickel exports has exploded from $1.06 billion in 2014 to almost $6 billion in 2022, according to United Nations data. Nickel prices have steadily appreciated in recent years, more than doubling to $21,690 per tonne from a historic low in 2016.The government of President-elect Prabowo Subianto, who takes office in October, is likely to follow up with a second step in the development plan: a ban on the export of refined nickel, which would encourage manufacturers to set up factories in Indonesia. Companies including LG and Hyundai have already built battery and EV production facilities in the country.Story continuesBy supplying a key component to EVs, Indonesia has landed squarely in the middle of an intensifying rivalry between China and the U.S. So far the government in Jakarta has struck a delicate balance between the two superpowers. China has invested $17.2 billion in Indonesia’s metals sector since 2006, recently pouring money into local refining capacity, according to the American Enterprise Institute. An additional $10 billion is in the pipeline. “Indonesia has grabbed Chinese attention because it appears to be the best metals choice at scale,” says Derek Scissors, senior fellow at the institute. At the same time, as a neutral country in the U.S.-China rift, Indonesia hopes it will be able to funnel vast quantities of commodities to both nations—even if its refiners are funded by Chinese money.“Indonesia has grabbed Chinese attention because it appears to be the best metals choice at scale.”Derek Scissors, American Enterprise InstituteIndonesia has attempted to replicate its nickel strategy with export bans on other minerals like bauxite, copper, and tin. Udith Sikand of Gavekal Research is skeptical Jakarta can repeat its nickel success. Indonesia has a “near stranglehold” on nickel production, he says, but “faces a much more competitive landscape” for the other metals. There are plenty of alternative countries where companies can source their supplies.Indonesia’s cornering of commodities is intended to boost the fortunes of homegrown firms like Amman Mineral Internasional, Harita Nickel, Merdeka Copper Gold, and Merdeka Battery Materials, all of which appear on the inaugural Fortune Southeast Asia 500 list this year. Prabowo has vowed to deliver annual economic growth of 8%. In the first quarter of 2024, Indonesia GDP grew 5.11%, surpassing estimates.Still, continued growth is not guaranteed. Indonesia’s nickel push is under threat for the risks it poses to the environment and the people mining and refining the resource.Indonesia has largely failed, critics say, to uphold the latter part of Musk’s plea—to “mine nickel efficiently and in an environmentally sensitive way.” Incumbent president Joko Widodo had pledged to improve environmental standards in the industry, which is associated with deforestation and air and water pollution. But Didit Wicaksono, climate and energy manager at Greenpeace Indonesia, says that global demand for EVs has been “misinterpreted” by the government and “used to justify exploiting nickel as a critical mineral commodity supporting the electric-car industry, causing extraordinary environmental impacts and damage.” The government is fueling the development with coal, he adds, which will leave the country short of its emissions targets.And on occasion, nickel mining has proved deadly. In December, an explosion at a refinery owned by Tesla supplier Tsingshan, a Chinese commodities giant, killed 21 workers and injured dozens more. (The two firms did not respond to requests for comment.) Indonesian police have since brought charges of criminal negligence against two Chinese nationals.The strongest headwind, however, may be the struggling EV industry. Price cuts across the sector “are signaling that the market is saturated,” says Jesse Kuri of BCA Research.For now, though, Indonesia is charging ahead. When Musk visited Jakarta in late May to launch Starlink services, the government proposed that Tesla construct an electric-vehicle battery plant in the country. An official in charge of investment told reporters the Tesla boss said he would consider the offer, but Musk himself has given no comment.This article appears in the June/July 2024 Asia issue of Fortune with the headline, “Has Indonesia hit the nickel jackpot?”This story was originally featured on Fortune.com',

                        'Tesla shareholders on Thursday confirmed they want Elon Musk to get a massive record pay package for running Tesla for the last six years. The question now is, how much will he get going forward?The package, made up of 303 million stock options worth more than $47 billion based on the current value of Tesla shares, was thrown out in January by a judge in Delaware, where Tesla has been incorporated. Delaware Chancery Court Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick ruled in favor of a shareholder suit that the process by which Musk was awarded the options was “deeply flawed” and did not pass the burden of fairness.It’s not clear if even with the new shareholder vote that Musk will have the options returned to him, according to legal experts.“It’s not an automatic fix. It doesn’t override the decision,” Samantha Crispin, partner and chair of the corporate department at global law firm Baker Botts, told CNN. “The chancellor found a number of defects in the process.”But Tesla shareholders also approved moving Tesla’s state of incorporation to Texas, partly in reaction to the Delaware decision. So even if the courts in Delaware continue to rule against the pay package, the Tesla board could grant a new stock option award to Musk, although there would be negative tax implications for doing so rather than simply voting to restore the earlier options.Musk, who is not paid any kind of cash salary or bonus at Tesla, has been essentially working for free for more than a year, since Tesla hit the financial targets that awarded him the last of the options available in the 2018 package.The need for more options?It is clear that Musk believes he needs to receive additional stock options. Earlier this year he said he would not want to grow Tesla to become a leader in artificial intelligence and robotics — areas where he promised growth — without a compensation plan that would give him ownership of around 25% of the company’s stock. That would be about double the roughly 13% stake he currently owns. Although, if the 303 million stock options just re-approved by shareholders are restored, and if he exercises those options, his stake would top 20%.“I am uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI & robotics without having ~25% voting control. Enough to be influential, but not so much that I can’t be overturned,” Musk tweeted in January shortly before McCormick’s ruling. “Unless that is the case, I would prefer to build products outside of Tesla.” But Musk has suggested that the question of a new pay package would likely be delayed until questions about the 2018 package are finally settled.Story continuesMusk was not asked about a new pay package at Thursday’s annual shareholder’s meeting, which observers might consider an absolute love fest as shareholders heaped praise on the billionaire tech mogul.But the Tesla board made clear it believes some form of significant compensation is crucial to keeping him focused on Tesla and the challenges ahead, including his promises about making self-driving cars and humanoid robots widely available.“What we recognized in 2018 and continue to recognize today is that one thing Elon most certainly does not have is unlimited time,” Tesla board chair Robyn Denholm wrote to Tesla shareholders ahead of the most recent vote. “Nor does he face any shortage of ideas and other places he can make an incredible difference in the world. We want those ideas, that energy and that time to be at Tesla, for the benefit of you, our owners.”Other Musk fans in the investment community also want to see him get additional shares of Tesla, even if that means their own holdings are diluted. They see Musk as the driving force behind Tesla’s success, and crucial for its success into the future. Some are particularly eager to see him execute his plans for self-driving cars and robotaxis that they believe will change the economics of personal transportation even more than Tesla has changed the auto industry by spurring widespread use of EVs.“The idea of him acquiring more shares doesn’t scare me,” said Tasha Keeney, director of investment analysis at ARK Invest, which has the most bullish forecast for Tesla. “I think look at this as an extreme pivotal moment. That’s why it’s important to have Elon at Tesla and engaged and incentivized appropriately.”Elon Musk, the first trillionaire?Musk told shareholders Thursday he’s not planning on going anywhere, and said he thinks Tesla could succeed even without him, although he described himself as an “accelerant” to that success.It’s not clear how much any additional holdings would be needed to provide Musk with financial incentives to focus on Tesla, and take him to unprecedented levels of wealth. If the company’s stock does as well as Musk and his fans predict, his current holdings would appreciate in value so much that his 2018 $47 billion pay package will look like an afterthought.Ark Invest has a five-year target price for Tesla shares at $2,600 a share. That would be a 1,300% gain from its current value, something that would lift its total market cap to about $8 trillion, or more than the current values of Microsoft and Apple, combined, by 2029.Even if Musk doesn’t get the options from 2018 restored, his current holdings of 411 million shares, which are today worth a mere $73 billion, would be worth more than $1 trillion if Tesla shares hit that $2,600 target. That likely would make Musk the world’s first trillionaire, with his net worth rising more than the current net worths of the next five people on Bloomberg’s Billionaires list — Jeff Bezos, Bernard Arnault, Mark Zuckerberg, Larry Page and Bill Gates — combined. And that doesn’t even count his holdings in other companies such as SpaceX.Not everyone on that list got there through packages of stock options. For example, Bezos, the founder of Amazon, and Zuckerberg, who co-founded Facebook, both took large stakes in their companies as founders, but neither has received stock grants or options since those companies had initial public offerings in 1997 and 2012, respectively.In her decision, McCormick rejected the argument that Musk would be uncompensated if the package was thrown out, writing, “Musk’s preexisting equity stake provided him tens of billions of dollars for his efforts.”For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com',

                        'tesla shareholders on thursday confirmed they want elon musk to get a massive record pay package for running tesla for the last six years  the question now is  how much will he get going forward the package  made up of 303 million stock options worth more than  47 billion based on the current value of tesla shares  was thrown out in january by a judge in delaware  where tesla has been incorporated  delaware chancery court chancellor kathaleen mccormick ruled in favor of a shareholder suit that the process by which musk was awarded the options was  deeply flawed  and did not pass the burden of fairness it s not clear if even with the new shareholder vote that musk will have the options returned to him  according to legal experts  it s not an automatic fix  it doesn t override the decision   samantha crispin  partner and chair of the corporate department at global law firm baker botts  told cnn   the chancellor found a number of defects in the process  but tesla shareholders also approved moving tesla s state of incorporation to texas  partly in reaction to the delaware decision  so even if the courts in delaware continue to rule against the pay package  the tesla board could grant a new stock option award to musk  although there would be negative tax implications for doing so rather than simply voting to restore the earlier options musk  who is not paid any kind of cash salary or bonus at tesla  has been essentially working for free for more than a year  since tesla hit the financial targets that awarded him the last of the options available in the 2018 package the need for more options it is clear that musk believes he needs to receive additional stock options  earlier this year he said he would not want to grow tesla to become a leader in artificial intelligence and robotics   areas where he promised growth   without a compensation plan that would give him ownership of around 25  of the company s stock  that would be about double the roughly 13  stake he currently owns  although  if the 303 million stock options just re approved by shareholders are restored  and if he exercises those options  his stake would top 20   i am

A new report suggests Tesla is testing vehicles equipped with FSD on city streets and highways in the world's largest car market.Reuters cited a report from the government-backed Shanghai Observer that said ten Tesla vehicles with FSD are being tested ahead of what could be a much larger planned rollout later this year.Elon Musk has been strategically paving the way for an FSD rollout in China in recent months. His surprise visit to China on April 28, where he met with top Chinese officials, including Premier Li Qiang, clearly indicated Tesla's deepening ties with China.One day later, on April 29, news broke in US corporate media that Tesla would partner with Chinese tech giant Baidu for mapping and navigation software to support FSD, including satisfying regulators about data security and privacy requirements. Other reports said top Chinese officials gave Musk the greenlight to roll out FSD in some limited capacity.In May, Reuters reported that Tesla was preparing to register FSD with Chinese authorities for a planned rollout later this year. Chinese state media also stated that Tesla had begun building a Megapack factory in Shanghai.The larger rollout of FSD in China will be a golden opportunity for Tesla to expand revenue streams amid the worldwide slump in EV sales.

                        "Tesla (TSLA) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this electric car maker have returned +0.3%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.7% change. During this period, the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, which Tesla falls in, has lost 0.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Tesla is expected to post earnings of $0.60 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -34.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.1%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.47 points to a change of -20.8% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -1.1%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.24 indicates a change of +31.5% from what Tesla is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.3%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Tesla.Story continuesThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for TSLA _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Tesla, the consensus sales estimate of $24.91 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -0.1%. The $98.56 billion and $111.96 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +1.9% and +13.6%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryTesla reported revenues of $21.3 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -8.7%. EPS of $0.45 for the same period compares with $0.85 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $22.15 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -3.83%. The EPS surprise was -2.17%.Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Tesla is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Tesla. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

                        'By Blake Brittain(Reuters) -Tesla has sued its former supplier Matthews International in California federal court for allegedly stealing trade secrets related to Tesla\'s battery-manufacturing process and sharing them with the electric-vehicle giant\'s competitors.The lawsuit, filed on Friday in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, said Matthews owes damages that Tesla "conservatively estimates will exceed $1 billion" for misusing company trade secrets related to dry electrode battery manufacturing technology.Matthews in a statement on Monday said Tesla\'s lawsuit is "simply a new tactic in their ongoing efforts to bully Matthews and improperly take Matthews\' valuable intellectual property," and that it would "vigorously defend the matter."Attorneys and spokespeople for Tesla did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Monday.Pittsburgh-based Matthews began supplying Tesla with manufacturing machinery in 2019, according to the complaint. Tesla said it shared secrets with Matthews related to dry-electrode coating, which the carmaker has said can dramatically reduce the size, cost, energy consumption and production cycle time of battery manufacturing plants while boosting the energy density and power of battery cells.The lawsuit said Matthews shared Tesla\'s innovations with unnamed competitors by selling "machines and other technologies embodying Tesla\'s trade secrets." It also said Matthews claimed Tesla\'s inventions as its own in patent filings that have revealed confidential Tesla information.Tesla asked the court to block Matthews from misusing its trade secrets and hand over its patent applications in addition to requesting monetary damages.(Reporting by Blake Brittain in WashingtonEditing by David Bario and Nick Zieminski)',

                        "Though Tesla (TSLA) shareholders voted to reinstate Elon Musk's pay package on Thursday afternoon, some investors and analysts told Yahoo Finance they remain skeptical.“The whole thing is a game of chicken and the shareholders blinked,” early Tesla investor Ibrahim AlHusseini said. “Fear of loss is a big motivator and Elon wielded that psychological mechanism to his benefit.”The venture capitalist said he unenthusiastically voted in favor of the $56 billion package.“The deal was set in 2018 when the milestones seemed virtually impossible and he met them,\" said AlHusseini, who first invested in Tesla in a Series C funding round. \"He made a deal, he delivered, and this is his reward.”Tesla's stock has been down nearly 30% year to date, and dropped roughly 2.5% on Friday. Now that the vote is over, AlHusseini said the stock should remain steady until its next quarterly earnings, where he forecasts that “shares will drop due to another miss on deliveries and margin.”Tesla said 77% voted to support Musk’s pay package. According to the filing, investors who held 1.76 billion shares voted to approve the deal, while 528.9 million shares voted against it. 20.6 million shares did not vote.“I just want to start off by saying, hot damn, I love you guys,” Musk said onstage at the shareholder meeting. The package, comprised of options, was originally valued at up to $56 billion but is now worth roughly $46 billion due to a fall in Tesla's market capitalization.In January, Delaware Chancery Court Judge Kathaleen McCormick ruled that the original pay package, which was approved by 73% of voted shares in 2018, was not negotiated fairly.The vote to reinstate the package doesn’t necessarily mean that Musk will get the historic pay. A favorable vote doesn't resolve the legal challenge, and likely won’t change the judge’s mind. Legal experts say the final decision will be tied up with the Supreme Court and Delaware Chancery Court.Tesla CEO Elon Musk gets in a Tesla car as he leaves a hotel in Beijing, China May 31, 2023. (REUTERS/Tingshu Wang/File Photo) (Reuters / Reuters)New York City Comptroller Brad Lander, who was among the shareholders urging for a vote against the package, calls the approval “a mistake.” Lander overseas several pension funds that own about 3.4 million Tesla shares.“We’ll see how Musk moves forward, if this leads to him focusing on Tesla and developing clear plans for growth,” Lander told Yahoo Finance. “But if it becomes one more battle, distraction, Twitter feud, and more ego — that won’t be a good thing.”Tesla’s largest outside institutional shareholder, Vanguard, was pivotal in the deal's passage. Vanguard, which holds 7% of Tesla stock, initially voted no in 2018, citing concerns over the size in relation to the company’s performance.Story continuesLongtime Tesla investor Ross Gerber has questioned Vanguard's move. \"Index funds are supposed to represent the public and often have corporate governance expectations for the companies. It seems a little bit weird that they voted for the pay package and said it aligns with shareholder incentives — which it does, but at an outrageous value,” he told Yahoo Finance.Gerber, who co-founded investment firm Gerber Kawasaki, voted yes in 2018 but advocated for a no this time. He started investing in Tesla in 2014, and his firm holds 332,000 shares as of March 31.“The package is outrageous and his performance has been horrendous for the last three years,” said Gerber. “But I believe in elections, so if that's what shareholders want, that’s fine.”Investors also passed a proposal to reincorporate Tesla from Delaware to Texas, which Musk pushed for after the judge voided his pay deal.“This is part of the distraction problem,” Lander said. “Delaware has a set of relatively conservative laws that are the foundation of shareholder capitalism. To then pack up your marbles and move to Texas because you’re pissy about a judge who said you have to follow the rules, the question is how are you going to reset?”Lander says he sees a strong foundation for Tesla to build on despite some worrying signs, adding that they have no immediate plans to change their investment strategy.“Elon deserves a great share of the credit,” Lander said. “Not a $56 billion share, but a very great share.”Analysts say shareholders' decision to restore Musk’s compensation package is a win for investors.Canaccord Genuity managing director George Gianarikas, who has a Buy rating on the stock, told Yahoo Finance he is “very encouraged” by the vote of confidence in Musk’s leadership.“Elon Musk is critical to the success of Tesla in the past and in the future,” Gianarikas explained.Gianarikas said Tesla’s prospects of developing full self-driving set the automaker apart from competitors, putting the company in an “incredibly enviable position.”Wedbush’s Dan Ives, a longtime Tesla bull, described the approval as a “pop-the-champagne moment” for Musk and shareholders. He said the pay package approval removes a $20 to $25 overhang on shares.“This is just the start of the next chapter, as Musk calls it, in the Tesla growth story. It's one of the best disruptive names in the world,” Ives said. “It's one of the best AI plays in the market.”Ives, who cautions a no vote could have resulted in Musk leaving Tesla, sees Tesla’s valuation surpassing $1 trillion in 2025 as Musk dedicates more time and focus to the automaker.\"You're seeing old-school Musk return now ... Tesla needs Musk and Musk needs Tesla,” Ives added.But Dave Harden, chief investment officer of Summit Global, cautioned against buying Tesla shares at this time.\"It's significant dilution possibilities for shareholders, and it causes one to want to do things that are risky,\" said Harden.The company has not proven itself in AI and robotics, and its major growth burst in EVs has already happened, Harden argues.\"I think that there's going to be much more chatter and much more opportunity to get in when you can see clearly that the growth is going to happen,\" said Harden.\"I would recommend to hold on Tesla and wait. If you're in the shares, I'd probably sell,\" he added.Yasmin Khorram is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance. Follow Yasmin on Twitter/X @YasminKhorram and on LinkedIn.

                        "It's been a tough go for investors in Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) over the last couple of years. Since the stock hit an all-time high of $407 in 2021, it's been a grueling road down.Yet despite this descent, there are several reasons Tesla remains not only the best electric vehicle (EV) stock for investors today but also the best company to gain exposure to the future of technological innovation. Here's why -- even though the stock is down more than 50% from its all-time highs -- it's worth buying and holding forever.The EV catalysts worth notingSince EVs constitute the majority of Tesla's business, it's essential to examine the company's prospects from the perspective of the current state of the automobile market. Unfortunately, this is why it has been struggling so much. With high interest rates dampening demand, several EV manufacturers -- not just Tesla -- have taken a hit. This culminated in the company experiencing its first year-over-year decline in deliveries since 2020.Making matters worse are slipping profit margins and a series of layoffs earlier this year. Its stock has regained some losses, but just a few months ago, Tesla was down more than 65% from its highs.However, the tide might be starting to turn. Central banks in Canada, Sweden, Switzerland, and the European Union have recently cut interest rates for the first time since 2021, and the hope is that the U.S. will be next. As borrowing becomes more affordable, consumer investment in new vehicles is likely to increase, potentially giving Tesla's sales a substantial boost.While interest rate cuts would bode well for Tesla in the short term, the long term is what really matters. Fortunately, it is still well-positioned to benefit from the overarching trend of growing EV adoption. Analysts predict that by 2030, two out of every three cars sold globally will be EVs. As the world's largest EV manufacturer, Tesla stands to gain tremendously from this movement as it expands its global footprint.With its dominance in the U.S and a solid grasp on the European market, the company is currently building a new factory in Mexico and is in the beginning stages of entering India. That country presents an enormous opportunity as analysts expect India's EV market to reach up to 10 million units annually by 2030, or roughly eight times larger than the U.S. EV market today.By leveraging its extensive experience, leading production levels, and optimized supply chain, Tesla is uniquely poised to succeed in these emerging markets ripe for EV adoption.Story continuesImage source: Getty Images.Going beyond EVsEVs will remain a core component of Tesla's future, but it's important to address one issue. The stock trades at a valuation more than five times that of the next most-valuable automaker, Toyota.This makes investing in Tesla purely for its EV potential difficult to justify. The reason for such a high valuation relative to the rest of the EV industry lies in the company's ambitions beyond electric vehicles.TSLA PE Ratio ChartIn the future, Tesla aims to build out its business around artificial intelligence (AI), self-driving vehicles, and humanoid robots. If all goes according to plan, CEO Elon Musk believes his company will become the most valuable in the world.These ambitious endeavors might seem like wishful thinking, but there is mounting evidence that Tesla is on track to realize its AI-powered future. Enabling these technologies is Tesla's supercomputer, Dojo.The more powerful Dojo becomes, the closer Tesla gets to achieving full autonomy for its vehicles and creating more-advanced robots. Best of all, Dojo is becoming more capable, with a near-doubling in computational power since the beginning of 2023.If Tesla can keep up the pace, the successful realization of its goals carries not only the potential to transform society but also to take its financial performance to the next level.Quantifying this potential is challenging due to the nascent nature of the technology and the absence of existing markets for autonomous vehicles and humanoid robots. However, the opportunities are expected to be monumental.There are some projections that highlight this potential. For instance, ARK Invest's analysis on the impact of autonomous driving and the launch of a robotaxi business -- a venture Musk believes to hold \"quasi-infinite demand\" -- is revealing. According to ARK's Monte Carlo simulation, robotaxis could generate $400 billion in revenue, roughly eight times greater than current levels.Humanoid robots are an opportunity that Musk believes will be greater than EVs, and he thinks they could begin shipping by the end of 2025. Add that in with robotaxis, and the case for Tesla to keep growing for years to come and become more than an EV company looks all the more likely.A necessary disclaimerAs is common when discussing speculative topics of this nature, some with differing opinions might believe these endeavors will never come to fruition. While a valid concern, we must remember how far Tesla has come.What started as an unprofitable start-up bleeding cash has evolved into a successful automaker. If Tesla can replicate its EV success in its AI ventures, the realization of its goals becomes more a matter of when rather than if.Few companies today offer such comprehensive exposure to the technologies of tomorrow for investors with a long-term perspective and a tolerance for risk. The EV market might not see explosive growth in the short to midterm, but it is still on an upward trajectory. When combined with the impact of Tesla's AI advancements, the case for buying its shares and holding them forever becomes all the more compelling.Should you invest $1,000 in Tesla right now?Before you buy stock in Tesla, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Tesla wasn’t one of them.

                        "Tesla CEO Elon Musk was accused of insider trading in a lawsuit filed Thursday by a Tesla shareholder in Delaware Chancery Court.Shareholder Michael Perry claims in the filing that Musk sold over $7.5 billion of shares of his electric car company in late 2022 before potentially disappointing production and delivery numbers were made public.Perry said Tesla's stock took a nose dive after the company's fourth-quarter numbers went public on Jan. 2, 2023, and claimed that Musk \"improperly benefited\" by about $3 billion in insider profits.\"Musk exploited his position at Tesla, and he breached his fiduciary duties to Tesla,\" the lawsuit said, per Reuters. Perry asks the court to instruct Musk to return the profits he made from the trades.ELON MUSK URGES TESLA SHAREHOLDERS TO VOTE ON PAY WITH SPECIAL OFFERElon Musk, CEO of SpaceX and Tesla and owner of X, formerly known as Twitter, gestures as he attends the Viva Technology conference on innovation and startups at the Porte de Versailles exhibition centre in Paris, France, June 16, 2023.The lawsuit says Musk sold the shares on various dates in November 2022 and December 2022.READ ON THE FOX BUSINESS APPPerry also accused Tesla's directors of breaching their fiduciary duty by allowing Musk to sell the shares.Musk and Tesla did not immediately respond to Fox Business' request for comment.The lawsuit alleges that Musk, who in 2022 said demand for Tesla vehicles was \"excellent,\" learned about the underwhelming production and delivery numbers in mid-November via his access to real-time data, and sold his shares before the information went public.ELON MUSK'S XAI GETS $6B IN NEW FUNDING AND ANNOUNCES VALUATIONModels of the new energy vehicle series are being displayed at a Tesla store in Shanghai, China, on March 26, 2024.When Tesla announced it would discount vehicle prices and released the data in January, analysts raised concerns that the company's cars weren't in demand, and Tesla's stock price dropped.\"Had (Musk) waited to make these sales until after the release of material adverse news ... his sales would have netted him less than 55% of the amounts realized from his November and December 2022 sales,\" the lawsuit said.The lawsuit comes as Musk has urged Tesla shareholders to vote to reinstate his $56 billion pay package after a Delaware judge struck it down in January.The judge ruled that Tesla's board of directors didn't adequately disclose their personal ties to Musk and that the company was on pace to meet most of the plan's benchmarks. Due to the lack of those disclosures to shareholders, the compensation plan's excessive size resulted in it being voided by the judge.TESLA SHAREHOLDERS URGED TO NIX ELON MUSK'S $56B PAY PACKAGEElon Musk attends the 2024 Breakthrough Prize Ceremony at the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures on April 13, 2024, in Los Angeles, California.Musk responded to the ruling by pushing for Tesla to change its state of incorporation from Delaware to Texas, which is another item that is being presented to shareholders for them to vote on at the annual meeting.Story continuesMusk also faces a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) probe into his 2022 acquisition of Twitter, the social media platform he rebranded as X.

                        "Some investors perceive the electric vehicle revolution as an inevitability and believe that internal combustion engines will eventually go the way of the Dodo bird. That's why many EV stocks trade at higher valuations than traditional carmakers.But what if they're wrong?After several years of torrid growth, the electric vehicle industry saw a big slowdown over the past year, prompting questions about whether EVs can really catch on beyond their early adopters.To make matters worse, Japanese auto companies Toyota (NYSE: TM), Subaru (OTC: FUJHY), and Mazda (OTC: MZDA.Y) made an announcement last week that could make EV-makers' tough year that much more difficult.A new kind of combustion engineOn Tuesday, May 28, Toyota, Subaru, and Mazda announced a lineup of innovative new combustion engines that can be used either in a stand-alone or hybrid form in conjunction with a battery.The new engines will be combustion engines but also compatible with alternative fuels such as e-fuel (synthetic fuel), biofuels, and liquid hydrogen. Liquid hydrogen, provided the hydrogen is made from electrolysis, emits zero carbon dioxide (CO2). And while both e-fuel and biofuels do emit some carbon dioxide, they're considered \"carbon neutral.\" This is because e-fuels are made from captured CO2 from the atmosphere, which is then combined with hydrogen to produce synthetic fuel. Meanwhile, the justification for biofuels is that the plant biomass grown to make biofuels takes CO2 out of the atmosphere during photosynthesis. That may be a bit of a stretch, as all plants use photosynthesis, so at least for biofuels, there would have to be enough new plants put in the ground to offset the biofuel combustion.Still, a future hybrid vehicle that combines a battery with one of these no-carbon or \"carbon-neutral\" fuels could be a killer for mainstream EV adoption.After all, the recent year has exposed some glaring holes in the \"EV revolution\" thesis. For one, EVs, in general, tend to cost more than internal combustion vehicles or hybrids, scaring off budget-constrained consumers amid higher interest rates. Second, there have been fears that the widespread adoption of EVs, combined with AI data centers, could strain the electric grid to an unsustainable degree. Furthermore, if the electricity used to charge up EVs comes from either a coal or natural gas-fired power plant, that EV really isn't doing anything positive for CO2 emissions anyway.Finally, many consumers have \"range anxiety,\" as they worry about an EV running out of charge without having an accessible working charger close by. Compounding this is today's public charging stations, which have proven disappointingly unreliable. A 2022 study showed that about 23% of public \"fast chargers\" in San Francisco didn't work. And fully charging an electric vehicle takes at least two hours today, even for the fastest-charging, smallest-battery EVs.Story continuesImage source: Getty Images.Toyota has been ahead of the gameYears ago, Toyota's former CEO, Akio Toyoda, rejected the assertion that EVs would quickly overtake ICE vehicles, citing many of the affordability and lifestyle issues we're seeing now. Instead, he pushed Toyota to take a diversified approach, which seems to have been vindicated.Last quarter, Toyota posted an impressive 21.4% revenue growth on the back of a shocking 138.6% growth in Prius hybrid sales. In another shocking data point, hybrid vehicle registrations outpaced electric vehicle registrations in Europe in February, reversing a long trend in one of the most EV-friendly places on earth. Meanwhile, Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), the most mature EV brand, saw a 13% decline in vehicle sales in the first quarter.The surge in hybrid sales shows the consumer does want a low-carbon and fuel-efficient vehicle, but might not be ready to make the leap to a full battery-powered EV just yet. This is especially true for one-car households that need a vehicle for both short and long drives.Today's hybrids do burn fossil fuels, even if they are more efficient. But with Japanese automakers innovating around new combustion engines that can use low or carbon-neutral fuels in combination with a battery, the competitive pressure on pure-play EV players like Tesla, Rivian (NASDAQ: RIVN), or Chinese players like Nio (NYSE: NIO) could become intense.Winners and losersIt's pretty obvious who the losers would be if these new engines take off: those vehicle brands that have gone all-in on electric vehicles without any backup plan. And the largest and most expensive EV stock is Tesla. Of course, Tesla has the engineering talent to develop a hybrid vehicle if it chooses to, but given that it has resisted up until this point, it's an open question as to whether the company would adapt.The winners? Not only Toyota and the other companies listed here, but also companies exposed to the burgeoning hydrogen ecosystem. These include hydrogen pure play Plug Power, as well as hydrogen production and transportation equipment provider Chart Industries, among others.So for those looking to invest in the next generation of automotive stocks, it will be critically important to stay on top of these new alternative fuel combustion engines, and how the battery EV industry adapts -- or doesn't.Should you invest $1,000 in Toyota Motor right now?Before you buy stock in Toyota Motor, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Toyota Motor wasn’t one of them.

                        "The sustainable-energy industry presents many interesting opportunities for investors. One of the more popular choices among green-energy investors is in electric vehicles (EVs). While I'm sure you're familiar with Tesla, other players, such as Rivian (NASDAQ: RIVN), are beginning to emerge onto the scene.Right now, Rivian stock trades for just $10 per share -- narrowly above its 52-week low. While this might tempt some investors to think that now is an opportunity to buy the dip, I see Rivian's depressed price action as warranted.Below, I'll break down what's going wrong at Rivian and why this is a stock to avoid like the plague.Rivian is selling lots of cars, but it comes with a catchLet's begin with the positives. I'm not a car enthusiast, but I must admit that Rivian's cars look pretty cool. In my neck of the woods (greater Philadelphia), I've noticed a rising number of Rivian cars on the road.During the first quarter of 2024, Rivian delivered 13,588 cars, which represented an increase of 71% year over year. Moreover, the company unveiled a series of new mid-size SUV models -- implying that demand for its trucks is strong.While this might all seem encouraging, the table below illustrates one glaring issue with Rivian's business.CategoryQ1 2023Q2 2023Q3 2023Q4 2023Q1 2024Vehicles produced9,39513,99216,30417,54113,980Vehicles delivered7,94612,64015,56413,97213,588Revenue$661 million$1.1 billion$1.3 billion$1.3 billion$1.2 billionGross profit per vehicle delivered($67,329)($32,595)($30,648)($43,372)($38,784)Data source: Rivian Investor Relations.At first glance, the results above might look good. Rivian is doing an impressive job scaling up production and, for the most part, can sell and deliver the cars it's manufacturing.The problem surfaces when you look at the company's gross profit per car. At the end of the first quarter, Rivian lost $38,784 for each vehicle that it delivered. Think of it this way: For every $1 that Rivian gets for its cars, the business loses $0.38. This is a prime example of upside-down unit economics.Image source: Getty Images.Should you invest in Rivian stock?While the EV realm is filled with investment opportunities, I don't see Rivian as too compelling. It's good to see that the company is ramping up production and able to generate rising revenue. Clearly, there's some demand for its cars, and the revenue figures above indicate that the company has been able to command some attractive pricing.Furthermore, the company's gross profit per vehicle is trending in the right direction. This time last year, Rivian lost $67,000 per vehicle delivered. The company has been able to trim these losses by more than 40%, thanks to improving materials costs and more efficient production processes.Story continuesNevertheless, costs are still outpacing Rivian's revenue acceleration. This results in a business that continues burning significant cash, despite some marginal reductions in operating losses.On top of all of this, Rivian faces intense competition. And bigger counterparts, like Tesla, are doing whatever they can to outmaneuver the competition. For example, over the last year, Tesla has resorted to aggressive price reductions on its vehicles to make them look more attractive than competing EVs. Yet even with these price cuts, Tesla still remains profitable on each car that it sells.I think that Rivian is stuck between a rock and a hard place. Sure, the company might eventually turn a profit on its vehicles, but this will take years to achieve. And in that time, companies like Tesla are using its excess cash flow to reinvest in other growth initiatives beyond EVs.For all of these reasons, I would avoid investing in Rivian stock. While shares might look cheap, there's a reason for it.The most prudent strategy is to sit on the sidelines and monitor the company's progress over the next several quarters. Should Rivian show some real progress and a path toward consistent profitability, long-term investors will have ample opportunities to buy the stock along the way.Should you invest $1,000 in Rivian Automotive right now?Before you buy stock in Rivian Automotive, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Rivian Automotive wasn’t one of them.

                        "You don't need to be rich to make a lot of money on the stock market. While it certainly helps if you can invest larger sums of money, it's possible to generate some life-changing returns with more modest sums. You just need to buy the right stocks. Three stocks that turned a $10,000 investment into $100,000 over the past five years are Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI), Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), and Builders FirstSource (NYSE: BLDR). Here's a closer look at each one of these businesses, including a discussion about why their shares took off and whether they remain good investments for your portfolio today.1. Super Micro ComputerA $10,000 investment in Supermicro just five years ago would now be worth more than $429,140. The stock surged as investors saw it as a promising artificial intelligence (AI) play. Supermicro provides companies with AI solutions, including servers, which can help train complex artificial intelligence models.Business is booming for Supermicro, and the tech company recently raised its guidance. For its current fiscal year (which ends in June), management expects revenue to come in between $14.7 billion and $15.1 billion (the previous guidance called for revenue between $14.3 billion and $14.7 billion). At the midpoint, that would imply an annual growth rate of 110% (Supermicro generated $7.1 billion in sales in its previous fiscal year). Despite Supermicro's surging numbers, its share price isn't obscene from a valuation perspective. Investors pay 24 times Supermicro's expected future earnings for a piece of the business. With so much growth still ahead in AI, there could be more gains for investors who buy the stock today.2. TeslaTesla's stock has struggled this year. It's trading down 28% since January. However, it has still made for a terrific investment over the past five years. Over that time, a $10,000 investment would have grown to $142,290.The electric vehicle (EV) maker's business continues to grow at a rapid rate. The company more than tripled its revenue from less than $32 billion in 2020 to nearly $97 billion by the end of 2023. Profits also grew, with Tesla reporting a profit margin of 15% in 2023.Tesla does face some challenges ahead, including increased competition from Chinese EV makers and a drop in product demand partially related to macroeconomic conditions. However, Tesla's leadership status in the EV market could still make for a good long-term play. Trading at 46 times its trailing earnings, Tesla is not a cheap stock. But if you're bullish on the EV market, it could make for a much more attractive long-term investment at its current reduced price. Story continues3. Builders FirstSourceYou don't necessarily need to invest in tech to earn a great return. Builders FirstSource is a solid example of that. Its five-year gains are the lowest among the three stocks, but an investor would still end up with more than $108,660 today if he or she invested $10,000 into the business five years ago.Builders FirstSource provides building materials, supplies, and construction services to homebuilders and contractors, and it has benefited from a boom in the housing market in recent years. Like with Tesla, business has slowed somewhat recently for Builders FirstSource as it deals with some challenging macroeconomic conditions. In the first three months of the year, net sales totaled just $3.9 billion (essentially flat year over year). And the company's net income of $258.8 million fell by 23% compared to the prior-year quarter. Builders FirstSource management isn't expecting a huge year in 2024 -- it projects sales to total between $17.5 billion and $18.5 billion, suggesting just 5% growth at the midpoint.Trading at a relatively modest 15 times earnings, this is a stock that could be a sleeper pick right now. The housing market is likely to rebound in the long run, and with a strong business, Builders FirstSource could make for an underrated buy.Should you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?Before you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Super Micro Computer wasn’t one of them.

                        '(Reuters) - A Tesla shareholder filed a lawsuit on Thursday accusing CEO Elon Musk of insider trading when he sold over $7.5 billion of shares of the electric car maker in late 2022, saying the billionaire entrepreneur sold the shares before potentially disappointing production and delivery numbers were made public.Shareholder Michael Perry, in the lawsuit filed in Delaware Chancery Court, said that Tesla\'s share price plummeted after the company\'s fourth-quarter numbers were made public on Jan. 2, 2023, and claimed that Musk "improperly benefited" by about $3 billion in insider profits."Musk exploited his position at Tesla, and he breached his fiduciary duties to Tesla," the lawsuit said, asking the court to direct Musk to return the profits made from the trades.According to the lawsuit, Musk sold the shares on various dates in November 2022 and December 2022.The lawsuit also accused Tesla\'s directors of breaching their fiduciary duty by allowing Musk to sell the shares.Musk and Tesla did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.In the lawsuit, Perry said Musk - who in 2022 said demand for Tesla\'s vehicles was "excellent" - found out about the lower-than-expected numbers mid-November, with his access to real-time data, and sold his shares before the information was public.Following news of vehicle price discounts that sparked demand concerns and the release of the numbers in January, Tesla\'s stock tanked."Had (Musk) waited to make these sales until after the release of material adverse news,... his sales would have netted him less than 55% of the amounts realized from his November and December 2022 sales," the lawsuit said.The lawsuit is the latest legal headache for Musk.It comes as Musk faces opposition from some Tesla shareholders who are set to vote on June 13 on whether to ratify his $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided in January because she found he improperly controlled the process.Tesla is incorporated in Delaware.Musk is also in the middle of a regulatory probe to determine whether he broke federal securities laws in 2022 when he bought stock in social media platform Twitter, which he later renamed X. Musk said the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was trying to "harass" him through unwarranted investigations.Musk and the top U.S. markets regulator have been in a years-long feud, dating back to 2018, when he tweeted that he had "funding secured" to take Tesla private.A separate shareholder lawsuit has accused Musk of defrauding X investors by delaying disclosure of his stake in the social media company to amass shares at lower prices.(Reporting by Abhirup Roy in San Francisco; Editing by Leslie Adler)',

You're listening to Motley Fool Money. I'm Ricky Mulvey joined today by Asit Sharma, Asit. Good, we've been talking for 20 minutes, but it's still good to see you.Asit Sharma: Good to see you, Ricky.Ricky Mulvey: There's one story on the platter for the A segment and that is NVIDIA. They reported yesterday, high expectations in the business. Asit is still crushing it. Revenue was 26 billion, which is a billion more than the analysts were expecting. They got to 10 for one stock split and they also announced the new chip platform. The Blackwell is in full production. Do you have any big takeaways before we get to the meat of the business?Asit Sharma: Ricky, yeah I've got one takeaway. I think there must be some return on investment here for all the companies, the hyperscalers, the enterprise businesses, the internet businesses that are buying products from NVIDIA. This is one thing analysts have worried about for a while. What if we get to the end of the road and people find out that generative AI doesn't really change much? Well, it's changing a lot. We saw that in the fact that NVIDIA, which had such a blowout quarters you mentioned, is up 10% today because in the fourth quarter is when they think Blackwell will really start to sell its out-of-production. They only put their estimates for one quarter at a time. It's leaving the whole investment community guessing how much more revenue can grow sequentially year-over-year, two quarters from now.Story continuesRicky Mulvey: There's a lot of exciting things going on with NVIDIA. This is a data center business though. It's how NVIDIA makes most of its money in just an eye-popping figure, or I'm going to the decimal, I'm sorry, 427% year-over-year growth for the data center business. I want to know who are the customers buying, what are they buying. How do they grow that much?Asit Sharma: That's so fascinating, Ricky, this has made the other segments that NVIDIA reports just look like afterthoughts because they're in a couple of billion in the hundreds of millions. The customers primarily are the big Cloud providers. I say primarily that's not really the whole story but yesterday in the call management said that 40% of customers were coming from this data center Cloud business. You can think of the big Cloud titans, Microsoft, Amazon, Oracle, etc. This is the group that's pushing the growth, but enterprise businesses are buying it. Academic institutions are buying NVIDIA products. As we saw, this is a theme now in the last three calls, sovereign governments, which are trying to develop their own strategy. Whole country-specific avenues of revenue are being opened up by NVIDIA. All this comes together, but the real meat and potatoes of their business right now are the big, familiar Cloud titans. They're driving the acceleration.Ricky Mulvey: Let's talk about Sovereign AI for a minute because this is throughout the call. They're trying to paint the picture of the next growth stories, the next growth waves for NVIDIA products. This is something that Jensen Wong has talked a lot about, which is sovereign AI or a nation's basically capability to produce artificial intelligence using its own infrastructure, data, workforce, business networks. Basically, all of the data produced in a country, the government should be able to control that and then create intelligence out of it using NVIDIA products. Of course, Asit. Are you as bullish on this as Jensen Wong is or there's the cynical take of if there's a gold rush, you want to sell picks and shovels to everyone?Asit Sharma: I'm medium bullish on it, Ricky, for one detail. That is that NVIDIA has been building their own data centers and playing around with these for a long time. They have the capability to configure data centers. They say almost instantaneously. What that means is that if you are a country like France, which is a customer of NVIDIA's. If you are a Middle Eastern oil-rich company that wants to diversify your country's GDP base, you want to be able to do that very quickly. If you're going to take a chunk of that GDP in a year and put it in NVIDIA's coffers and they're able to deliver on that. Their systems are highly configurable. If you show NVIDIA, this is our data infrastructure. They've got products which are supercomputers which are backward compatible. They've got the Blackwell, for example, which can be air-cooled. It can also be liquid-cooled. This configurability, the idea that they can help you build data centers in a really rapid fashion, gives some legs to their predictions. I think they said that this is going to be a high single-digit billion-dollar business in the very near future. I don't disbelieve them on that. Now, I'm not quite as bullish as Jensen Wong is on this. I think every proposition out in the business world has to be tested even if it's coming from NVIDIA. We'll see but medium bullish shoreRicky Mulvey: I would say the other growth story that's getting tested right now is autonomous driving. We have a new update from Tesla and their full self-driving cars, which NVIDIA discussed on the call but also when we were watching this morning, we were watching a full self-driving video of a Tesla with the latest update, but it seems, they're not quite there yet. Essentially it was a car in Chicago where a car stops in front of it, the hazards turned on, but the Tesla is still maybe not able to pick up the fact that the hazards or on the car is stuck in traffic and it needs to go into the rate lane in order to get around the traffic.Asit Sharma: I'm not going to give you my personal answer on this, Ricky. I'm going to give you the answer that I think NVIDIA's management would give to investors. That is to say that in the past, Tesla has, yes, relied on NVIDIA hardware and software to train their supercomputer. They've also used a lot of data straight from vehicles. Everyone is aware of this. If you drive a Tesla that's contributing to their machine-learning but there's been a shift since, I would say the beginning of the generative AI explosion in that NVIDIA, which has really great core competencies and physics, the optics of physics is pushing this vision of autonomous driving being trained on video models. Instead of gathering data from cars, now, NVIDIA is working with Tesla and other manufacturers to have their artificial intelligence machines watch a ton of video because it's Jensen Wong will tell you the best way for an AI to learn if you are looking at autonomous driving isn't really to gather data from vehicles, but it's to understand the physics of the world. The best way for the AI to do that is by sitting in front of a screen watching a bunch of videos like the one you and I were watching and laughing at this morning, and to that extent, they mentioned supporting Tesla's expansion of its AI supercomputer via 35,100 GPUs. That's quite a big number and a quite a huge capital investment but this is the way of the future now for autonomous driving, its inference, and its training being generated through video.Ricky Mulvey: Well, in the other part of whatever growth story NVIDIA tells you is, you may not know what the next one is. This is a company that started building GPUs for gaming computers that have turned out to work well for cryptocurrency mining operations and then in artificial intelligence, NVIDIA is very much selling during the earnings call. One it was selling is how valuable the customer relationships are. The one they featured was with Meta, which is now using its LAMA 3 AI system with NVIDIA hardware. NVIDIA saying that Meta will get $7 in revenue for every $1 they spend in server cost. Let's translate this into English. Does this just mean that Meta is making really good ads from the information they're getting through this or what Asit?Asit Sharma: Yeah, actually some of this gets pretty confusing. Here NVIDIA was really talking about the open-source large language model called LAMA 3 is the latest version they were referring to companies that will use LAMA 3. Think of a small AI start-up that has an LLM you want to use. They're saying if fees, start-ups, and enlarged companies as well are going to charge for the tokens for that usage. When you talk to a large language model, they can drive a seven bucks of revenue for every dollar that they're paying out on someone else's server. Now, obviously, Meta itself is making money off of both LAMA and the computational power and you're right, that they are making some money using this But really what they're referring to there is they're pitching to start-ups.Asit Sharma: Used technologists based on Nvidia. Let's talk about the value of the company for a little bit, this is one where the bulls are out enforce Asit and one that I'm honestly kicking myself for not owning since I started looking at it, as I'm sure some listeners are as well. This is now a two and a half trillion dollar company at about, let's say 38, 40 times forward earnings. At this point, what are your thoughts on Nvidia's valuation? I think it's a hard company to value. You have a company that has this incredible demand and they're already telegraphing to the market that were a bit now supply constrained, we're working with suppliers like TSMC and other partners in our ecosystem to get products as fast as we can to customers. On the other hand, they're also saying that we're innovating at this incredible pace and if you've heard our roadmap has up every year, which is superfast in this industry. It's also just about the innovation in data centers, the fact that now they are providing so much of a data center from the switches to the networking, other networking equipment to the software. They're working on their own InfiniBand technology, but now they play well with Ethernet. This is a company that's innovating in so many directions that it's not far-fetched to think that they could keep up from here. A pretty decent run rate going further, I don't think we're going to see again this 400% year over year growth but to be a two and a half trillion dollar company that could grow at a decent double digit rate, you would not really blinked that much to pay 38 times forward earnings for that. It's a premium company with a lock on its marketplace right now, so some of that isn't just about the expected earnings growth, it's about the stability of the perceived cash flow, so I don't think it's that expensive at 38 times, Ricky, maybe you can buy just a little bit here because I know for me when I've watched companies run up and it's painful if I didn't buy them. I found it easy to reduce that pain, just take a little bit and watch that bit from their. Nvidia is a company that gives you cyclical opportunities to buy. However, I think this is not truly an exception at some point, the steam will evaporate a bit, so there'll be more buying opportunities but right now for people who want to hold this company for a long term, it's still not too expensive and I'm glad you pointed out that multiple. It's not a crazy multiple and as you and I were chatting before the show, there's a few companies that are also big tech that are much more expensive than.Ricky Mulvey: It's basically at the same if we're using forward earnings, it's basically where Amazon is right now and it's below Tesla. Those are your sticks in the wind, Asit. Management would give you points for putting that PE ratio into context, they're all about context and how that plays into inferencing and everything they're doing with artificial intelligence.Asit Sharma: Is Michael Mauboussin every listens to this show, which I will not assume he does, I'm sure he would want to kick me from afar.Ricky Mulvey: I think he moves onto another podcast when both you and I are conversing in particular, let's end it there.Asit Sharma: Asit Sharma, as always, thank you for your time. Thank you for your insight. Thanks for breaking this down.Ricky Mulvey: Thanks a lot, Ricky, it's a lot of fun.Asit Sharma: Today's show is sponsored by public.com.

Last summer frequenting Cava, both IPO and the question heard around the investing world at the time was, is XX being Sweetgreen Kaba, the next Chipotle. As a consumer, I loved Chipotle and I feel like we glorify Chipotle stock a lot, but maybe for someone who's less familiar with investing, or new to investing in, and less familiar with Chipotle stock. What is it that makes Chipotle stock so great?Matt Frankel: It's such a great restaurant business, so I'm saying this from someone who ran restaurants and that was my first career way back when I'm aging myself, but the very early 2000s, it's a hard business to make money in. A good restaurant might make a 5% net margin if things are going well. People don't realize how little money good restaurants actually make. Chipotle has a 13% net margin. They're highly profitable business, they essentially invented that fast casual concept, fresh food fast. That was really a Chipotle thing and they really just a scale that beyond anybody's dreams. It's high quality food at fast food times and fast food prices and that's what made the business great. A lot of companies like Cava have essentially tried to replicate the model, but none have been able to do it with the scale and profitability of Chipotle yet.Mary Long: Yet is maybe the key keys there. Cava would sure like to think that the rest of that sentence ends in yet because as you said, Cava in many ways seems like a Mediterranean theme, Chipotle. It's the same concept of fast casual. That said, it's out of fart earlier growth stage, so theoretically, you could take that idea and say, oh, now's my chance to get in on the new Chipotle. I'm using air-quotes early. What, if anything is stopping Cava from becoming the next Chipotle?Matt Frankel: Personally, this is just anecdotal, but I can tell you that three Cavas have opened up within a 10-mile radius of me within the past year. You're right, they are in rapid growth mode and none of them were placed at Chipotle by the way, so Chipotle is still doing fine. You're right, they are in an earlier stage of growth, they're growing faster, they're expecting to grow revenue by about 20% next year. Chipotles is about 15%, there's consensus, so faster growth rate than Chipotle. Both businesses actually have identical gross margins, it was interesting to find when I was doing some research for this, they both have 33% gross margins. As you would expect, Cava is not nearly as profitable yet because they are in growth mode more so than Chipotle. Chipotle has, I'm not sure the exact number off the top of my head, but thousands of stores that are able to turn it into a compounding machine. Whereas Cava, they have fewer resources and faster growth, so they're not making a ton of money right now. Do not look at the PE on this stock. That doesn't tell you the story. They both trade from similar multiples of sales. It's really interesting businesses and I don't want to say the next Chipotle, that's like saying the next Berkshire Hathaway but covers in that conversation.Mary Long: We still try to make that comparison, the next a mini Berkshire Hathaway and that's maybe a perfect segue into our final matchup where we've got to specialty insurers, which are duking it out. First, in one corner, founded in 1930 and today boasting a market cap of 21.7-ish billion-dollars, we've got Markel. A stock that's up over 13,000.Mary Long: Bulbs that underlying that. Since it's 1980 IPO and is up 55 percent in the past five years. Other corner with a market cap just shy of $9 billion. We have Kinsale Capital Group that was founded in 1990, so it's not exactly a newbie, but it went public in 2016 and is the younger of the two companies here. Since then, Kinsale stock is up over 2,000 percent. That's since 2016, and in the past five years that stock is up 356 percent last I checked. I'm going to go ahead with all that information. I'm going to go ahead and say that Markel is our Goliath, but if that's the case, why has Kinsale seen better returns in the past five years?Matt Frankel: There's so much to unpack there. I own both of these stocks and I know both companies really well. We'll start with the insurance businesses. Both of these are insurance companies at their core at least, but they do things a little differently. They're both specialty insurers. Markel actually it's too big businesses. They've specialty insurance and they have reinsurance. Their reinsurance business. Think of it like insurance for insurance companies. If say, what's a good homeowners insurance companies, State Farm wants to limit their losses or exposure to like hurricanes or something like that, they might purchase a reinsurance policy that limits their exposure and would pay off in the event that a bad natural disaster hit, so they're not going out of business. That's a much more inconsistent business in insurance than property casualty insurance, so Markel's reinsurance business has actually been unprofitable in the past few years. Both of them are specialty insurers. Kinsale focuses on smaller accounts, so while it sounds like it is a smaller market share, Markel actually customer count wise they're more similar than you might think. Markel is not just an insurance company though. We said the next Berkshire Hathaway that was the big segue into this. They take a Berkshire-like approach. All insurers invest their money. That's how most insurers make most of their money from investing the money that they've taken in before they pay it out for claims. Markel invests in a big stock portfolio like Berkshire Hathaway does.Berkshire is actually it's largest investment and they also have Markel Ventures which is a venture capital division and unlike Berkshire, they can make small investments like that and have them move the needle if they do well. Kinsale they make their money on insurance. Markel is a standard profit margin when it comes to their insurance business. Their underwriting margin is in the 4-5 percent range which most insurers would be very happy with that and just to make more money off on their investment portfolio which Markel does. Kinsale on the other hand, and stop me if I rambled too much, but Kinsale on the other hand their investment portfolio is boring for lack of a better term. They invest in high-quality corporate bonds and treasury bonds and mostly fixed-income stuff. They have a small amount of common stocks, but nothing that is worth mentioning in the investment thesis. Their insurance business on the other hand is wildly profitable. I mentioned that Markel is underwriting margin is usually in the 4-5 percent range, meaning that after they pay all their claims and pay their business expenses they've a 4-5 percent margin of the premiums leftover. Kinsale is over 20 percent, about five times is profitable, so it's that's also why Kinsale is more highly valued on a price to sales basis. Highly profitable insurance business. If they ever get to the point where they're actually building a stock portfolio and making real money on investments, watch out. That's a lot of potential, but totally different insurance business dynamics and it's focused on small companies, a very overlooked area of specialty insurance that allows Kinsale to be that profitableMary Long: Yes, so when we talk about Kinsale's profitability, is it just able to out charge its competitors and with its insurance offerings? When I think about insurance and maybe stop me if this veers off into a different type of insurance and doesn't maybe apply to the specialty insurance area, but when I think about home insurance and natural does, I feel like there have been so many new stories of late about insurance companies that are stopping ensuring certain car manufacturers that are stopping to ensure houses in certain states, is the insurance business is getting harder and if so, does that impact positively or negatively Kinsale and with that Markel's ability to price?Matt Frankel: Great question, and I thought that too. I actually talked to with Kinsale CEO Mikey Hub a couple of weeks ago and he pointed this out to me because I had a misconception about this. It's not that their underwriting is that as profitable as we make it out to be. It said their costs are much better. There's two components to underwriting margin. There's the money that you're paying up for claims. That's called your loss ratio and there's the money that you're paying for the rest of your business, how to pay your employees, to pay your offices and things like that. That's your expense ratio. Can put them together, it's called your combined ratio, so Kinsale has a very low combined ratio, but it's more because of that expense ratio side of it than it is the underwriting side of it, so their underwriting is roughly 10 percent points more probably not that their expenses are roughly 10 percent points lower than their peer group and that's what's their very price competitive is really the point that their CEO wanted to make to me is that their price competitive. It's not that no one else is underwriting these policies for small companies. They can undercut everyone else because they have a low-cost structure. They automate most of their underwriting process. They have a proprietary technology platform that they view as their core competency and it allows them to be more profitable efficient on an expense basis than their peers.Mary Long: You mentioned early on that the market share in the specialty insurance business doesn't quite tell the whole story here, so I'll throw out some numbers just in case they were missed, but last I checked Kinsale has about one-and-a-half percent of the excess and surplus market which is what we're talking about often when we say specialty insurance? That basically means think of a weird or obscure business and act throwing business of marijuana dispensary that thing and that fits into the excess and surplus category, so Kinsale has one-and-a-half percent of that market. Markel has closer to 5.6 percent. That sounds like a small number, but that makes it I think the third largest insurer in the industry, so that in mind, how do we think about these two competitors, is it a growth story? If we're trying to pick the better company here, is it only one that we should be betting on or is it more about growth story, how do you think about this yet?Matt Frankel: Yes, so it's a very fragmented business. As you mentioned the number three has like a 5 percent market share and I think that number is one and two are Lloyd's and AIG that are especially insurance and you're right. It is the same insurance that you would buy for your home or for your car, but in situations where most insurers wouldn't want to touch it like the ASTORA business or if you're a Hollywood stuck man like life insurance that normal MetLife might say no, we don't really want to touch that, but that's where a specialty insurer comes in, so when it comes to smaller accounts, there's less competition. It's not really an apples-to-apples thing, but at the same time, another thing there Kinsale CEO Mikey Hub pointed out to me, there's a lot more small accounts than you would think. It was something like 80 percent of the E&S market, so I do think of them as competitors, but at the same time I think there's enough room for everybody for more than one big winner here to disrupt what I call the traditional players or the Lloyd's to AIG. Berkshire has a big specialty insurance business. Those are what I think of as their traditional players and there's room for both Kinsale and Markel to disrupt them.Ricky Mulvey: As always, people on the program may have interest in the stocks they talk about and the Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell anything based solely on what you hear.

mulvey  there s a lot of exciting things going on with nvidia  this is a data center business though  it s how nvidia makes most of its money in just an eye popping figure  or i m going to the decimal  i m sorry  427  year over year growth for the data center business  i want to know who are the customers buying  what are they buying  how do they grow that much asit sharma  that s so fascinating  ricky  this has made the other segments that nvidia reports just look like afterthoughts because they re in a couple of billion in the hundreds of millions  the customers primarily are the big cloud providers  i say primarily that s not really the whole story but yesterday in the call management said that 40  of customers were coming from this data center cloud business  you can think of the big cloud titans  microsoft  amazon  oracle  etc  this is the group that s pushing the growth  but enterprise businesses are buying it  academic institutions are buying nvidia products  as we saw  this is a theme now in the last three calls  sovereign governments  which are trying to develop their own strategy  whole country specific avenues of revenue are being opened up by nvidia  all this comes together  but the real meat and potatoes of their business right now are the big  familiar cloud titans  they re driving the acceleration ricky mulvey  let s talk about sovereign ai for a minute because this is throughout the call  they re trying to paint the picture of the next growth stories  the next growth waves for nvidia products  this is something that jensen wong has talked a lot about  which is sovereign ai or a nation s basically capability to produce artificial intelligence using its own infrastructure  data  workforce  business networks  basically  all of the data produced in a country  the government should be able to control that and then create intelligence out of it using nvidia products  of course  asit  are you as bullish on this as jensen wong is or there s the cynical take of if there s a gold rush  you want to sell picks and shovels to everyone asit sharma  i m medium bullish on it  ricky  for one detail  that is that nvidia has been building their own data centers and playing around with these for a long time  they have the capability to configure data centers  they say almost instantaneously  what that means is that if you are a country like france  which is a customer of nvidia s  if you are a middle eastern oil rich company that wants to diversify your country s gdp base  you want to be able to do that very quickly  if you re going to take a chunk of that gdp in a year and put it in nvidia s coffers and they re able to deliver on that  their systems are highly configurable  if you show nvidia  this is our data infrastructure  they ve got products which are supercomputers which are backward compatible  they ve got the blackwell  for example  which can be air cooled  it can also be liquid cooled  this configurability  the idea that they can help you build data centers in a really rapid fashion  gives some legs to their predictions  i think they said that this is going to be a high single digit billion dollar business in the very near future  i don t disbelieve them on that  now  i m not quite as bullish as jensen wong is on this  i think every proposition out in the business world has to be tested even if it s coming from nvidia  we ll see but medium bullish shorericky mulvey  i would say the other growth story that s getting tested right now is autonomous driving  we have a new update from tesla and their full self driving cars  which nvidia discussed on the call but also when we were watching this morning  we were watching a full self driving video of a tesla with the latest update  but it seems  they re not quite there yet  essentially it was a car in chicago where a car stops in front of it  the hazards turned on  but the tesla is still maybe not able to pick up the fact that the hazards or on the car is stuck in traffic and it needs to go into the rate lane in order to get around the traffic asit sharma  i m not going to give you my personal answer on this  ricky  i m going to give you the answer that i think nvidia s management would give to investors  that is to say that in the past  tesla has  yes  relied on nvidia hardware and software to train their supercomputer  they ve also used a lot of data straight from vehicles  everyone is aware of this  if you drive a tesla that s contributing to their machine learning but there s been a shift since  i would say the beginning of the generative ai explosion in that nvidia  which has really great core competencies and physics  the optics of physics is pushing this vision of autonomous driving being trained on video models  instead of gathering data from cars  now  nvidia is working with tesla and other manufacturers to have their artificial intelligence machines watch a ton of video because it s jensen wong will tell you the best way for an ai to learn if you are looking at autonomous driving isn t really to gather data from vehicles  but it s to understand the physics of the world  the best way for the ai to do that is by sitting in front of a screen watching a bunch of videos like the one you and i were watching and laughing at this morning  and to that extent  they mentioned supporting tesla s expansion of its ai supercomputer via 35 100 gpus  that s quite a big number and a quite a huge capital investment but this is the way of the future now for autonomous driving  its inference  and its training being generated through video ricky mulvey  well  in the other part of whatever growth story nvidia tells you is  you may not know what the next one is  this is a company that started building gpus for gaming computers that have turned out to work well for cryptocurrency mining operations and then in artificial intelligence  nvidia is very much selling during the earnings call  one it was selling is how valuable the customer relationships are  the one they featured was with meta  which is now using its lama 3 ai system with nvidia hardware  nvidia saying that meta will get  7 in revenue for every  1 they spend in server cost  let s translate this into english  does this just mean that meta is making really good ads from the information they re getting through this or what asit asit sharma  yeah  actually some of this gets pretty confusing  here nvidia was really talking about the open source large language model called lama 3 is the latest version they were referring to companies that will use lama 3  think of a small ai start up that has an llm you want to use  they re saying if fees  start ups  and enlarged companies as well are going to charge for the tokens for that usage  when you talk to a large language model  they can drive a seven bucks of revenue for every dollar that they re paying out on someone else s server  now  obviously  meta itself is making money off of both lama and the computational power and you re right  that they are making some money using this but really what they re referring to there is they re pitching to start ups asit sharma  used technologists based on nvidia  let s talk about the value of the company for a little bit  this is one where the bulls are out enforce asit and one that i m honestly kicking myself for not owning since i started looking at it  as i m sure some listeners are as well  this is now a two and a half trillion dollar company at about  let s say 38  40 times forward earnings  at this point  what are your thoughts on nvidia s valuation  i think it s a hard company to value  you have a company that has this incredible demand and they re already telegraphing to the market that were a bit now supply constrained  we re working with suppliers like tsmc and other partners in our ecosystem to get products as fast as we can to customers  on the other hand  they re also saying that we re innovating at this incredible pace and if you ve heard our roadmap has up every year  which is superfast in this industry  it s also just about the innovation in data centers  the fact that now they are providing so much of a data center from the switches to the networking  other networking equipment to the software  they re working on their own infiniband technology  but now they play well with ethernet  this is a company that s innovating in so many directions that it s not far fetched to think that they could keep up from here  a pretty decent run rate going further  i don t think we re going to see again this 400  year over year growth but to be a two and a half trillion dollar company that could grow at a decent double digit rate  you would not really blinked that much to pay 38 times forward earnings for that  it s a premium company with a lock on its marketplace right now  so some of that isn t just about the expected earnings growth  it s about the stability of the perceived cash flow  so i don t think it s that expensive at 38 times  ricky  maybe you can buy just a little bit here because i know for me when i ve watched companies run up and it s painful if i didn t buy them  i found it easy to reduce that pain  just take a little bit and watch that bit from their  nvidia is a company that gives you cyclical opportunities to buy  however  i think this is not truly an exception at some point  the steam will evaporate a bit  so there ll be more buying opportunities but right now for people who want to hold this company for a long term  it s still not too expensive and i m glad you pointed out that multiple  it s not a crazy multiple and as you and i were chatting before the show  there s a few companies that are also big tech that are much more expensive than ricky mulvey  it s basically at the same if we re using forward earnings  it s basically where amazon is right now and it s below tesla  those are your sticks in the wind  asit  management would give you points for putting that pe ratio into context  they re all about context and how that plays into inferencing and everything they re doing with artificial intelligence asit sharma  is michael mauboussin every listens to this show  which i will not assume he does  i m sure he would want to kick me from afar ricky mulvey  i think he moves onto another podcast when both you and i are conversing in particular  let s end it there asit sharma  asit sharma  as always  thank you for your time  thank you for your insight  thanks for breaking this down ricky mulvey  thanks a lot  ricky  it s a lot of fun asit sharma  today s show is sponsored by public com  that s where you can earn a 5 1  apy with a high yield cash account  while we can t say for certain it s the highest interest rate there is  we can say this  it s a higher rate than sofi  higher rate than marcus  a higher rate than wealthfront  a higher rate than betterment  frankly  a higher rate than capital one  a higher rate than ally  a higher rate than barclays  away higher rate than bank of america and chase  a higher rate than city wells fargo discover  and it s a higher rate than american express too  if you want to get started earning 5 1  apy on your cash checkout public com  we can t say it s the highest interest rate for your cash  but it s up there  this is a paid endorsement for public investing  5 1  apy as of march 26  2024 and is subject to change full disclosures and terms and conditions can be found in the podcast description us members only up next  mary long and matt frankel  look at two more david and goliath matchups  you can hear the first two on yesterday s episode  but this time it s in food and insurance mary long  next up  we ll go to cava and chipotle  last summer frequenting cava  both ipo and the question heard around the investing world at the time was  is xx being sweetgreen kaba  the next chipotle  as a consumer  i loved chipotle and i feel like we glorify chipotle stock a lot  but maybe for someone who s less familiar with investing  or new to investing in  and less familiar with chipotle stock  what is it that makes chipotle stock so great matt frankel  it s such a great restaurant business  so i m saying this from someone who ran restaurants and that was my first career way back when i m aging myself  but the very early 2000s  it s a hard business to make money in  a good restaurant might make a 5  net margin if things are going well  people don t realize how little money good restaurants actually make  chipotle has a 13  net margin  they re highly profitable business  they essentially invented that fast casual concept  fresh food fast  that was really a chipotle thing and they really just a scale that beyond anybody s dreams  it s high quality food at fast food times and fast food prices and that s what made the business great  a lot of companies like cava have essentially tried to replicate the model  but none have been able to do it with the scale and profitability of chipotle yet mary long  yet is maybe the key keys there  cava would sure like to think that the rest of that sentence ends in yet because as you said  cava in many ways seems like a mediterranean theme  chipotle  it s the same concept of fast casual  that said  it s out of fart earlier growth stage  so theoretically  you could take that idea and say  oh  now s my chance to get in on the new chipotle  i m using air quotes early  what  if anything is stopping cava from becoming the next chipotle matt frankel  personally  this is just anecdotal  but i can tell you that three cavas have opened up within a 10 mile radius of me within the past year  you re right  they are in rapid growth mode and none of them were placed at chipotle by the way  so chipotle is still doing fine  you re right  they are in an earlier stage of growth  they re growing faster  they re expecting to grow revenue by about 20  next year  chipotles is about 15   there s consensus  so faster growth rate than chipotle  both businesses actually have identical gross margins  it was interesting to find when i was doing some research for this  they both have 33  gross margins  as you would expect  cava is not nearly as profitable yet because they are in growth mode more so than chipotle  chipotle has  i m not sure the exact number off the top of my head  but thousands of stores that are able to turn it into a compounding machine  whereas cava  they have fewer resources and faster growth  so they re not making a ton of money right now  do not look at the pe on this stock  that doesn t tell you the story  they both trade from similar multiples of sales  it s really interesting businesses and i don t want to say the next chipotle  that s like saying the next berkshire hathaway but covers in that conversation mary long  we still try to make that comparison  the next a mini berkshire hathaway and that s maybe a perfect segue into our final matchup where we ve got to specialty insurers  which are duking it out  first  in one corner  founded in 1930 and today boasting a market cap of 21 7 ish billion dollars  we ve got markel  a stock that s up over 13 000 mary long  bulbs that underlying that  since it s 1980 ipo and is up 55 percent in the past five years  other corner with a market cap just shy of  9 billion  we have kinsale capital group that was founded in 1990  so it s not exactly a newbie  but it went public in 2016 and is the younger of the two companies here  since then  kinsale stock is up over 2 000 percent  that s since 2016  and in the past five years that stock is up 356 percent last i checked  i m going to go ahead with all that information  i m going to go ahead and say that markel is our goliath  but if that s the case  why has kinsale seen better returns in the past five years matt frankel  there s so much to unpack there  i own both of these stocks and i know both companies really well  we ll start with the insurance businesses  both of these are insurance companies at their core at least  but they do things a little differently  they re both specialty insurers  markel actually it s too big businesses  they ve specialty insurance and they have reinsurance  their reinsurance business  think of it like insurance for insurance companies  if say  what s a good homeowners insurance companies  state farm wants to limit their losses or exposure to like hurricanes or something like that  they might purchase a reinsurance policy that limits their exposure and would pay off in the event that a bad natural disaster hit  so they re not going out of business  that s a much more inconsistent business in insurance than property casualty insurance  so markel s reinsurance business has actually been unprofitable in the past few years  both of them are specialty insurers  kinsale focuses on smaller accounts  so while it sounds like it is a smaller market share  markel actually customer count wise they re more similar than you might think  markel is not just an insurance company though  we said the next berkshire hathaway that was the big segue into this  they take a berkshire like approach  all insurers invest their money  that s how most insurers make most of their money from investing the money that they ve taken in before they pay it out for claims  markel invests in a big stock portfolio like berkshire hathaway does berkshire is actually it s largest investment and they also have markel ventures which is a venture capital division and unlike berkshire  they can make small investments like that and have them move the needle if they do well  kinsale they make their money on insurance  markel is a standard profit margin when it comes to their insurance business  their underwriting margin is in the 4 5 percent range which most insurers would be very happy with that and just to make more money off on their investment portfolio which markel does  kinsale on the other hand  and stop me if i rambled too much  but kinsale on the other hand their investment portfolio is boring for lack of a better term  they invest in high quality corporate bonds and treasury bonds and mostly fixed income stuff  they have a small amount of common stocks  but nothing that is worth mentioning in the investment thesis  their insurance business on the other hand is wildly profitable  i mentioned that markel is underwriting margin is usually in the 4 5 percent range  meaning that after they pay all their claims and pay their business expenses they ve a 4 5 percent margin of the premiums leftover  kinsale is over 20 percent  about five times is profitable  so it s that s also why kinsale is more highly valued on a price to sales basis  highly profitable insurance business  if they ever get to the point where they re actually building a stock portfolio and making real money on investments  watch out  that s a lot of potential  but totally different insurance business dynamics and it s focused on small companies  a very overlooked area of specialty insurance that allows kinsale to be that profitablemary long  yes  so when we talk about kinsale s profitability  is it just able to out charge its competitors and with its insurance offerings  when i think about insurance and maybe stop me if this veers off into a different type of insurance and doesn t maybe apply to the specialty insurance area  but when i think about home insurance and natural does  i feel like there have been so many new stories of late about insurance companies that are stopping ensuring certain car manufacturers that are stopping to ensure houses in certain states  is the insurance business is getting harder and if so  does that impact positively or negatively kinsale and with that markel s ability to price matt frankel  great question  and i thought that too  i actually talked to with kinsale ceo mikey hub a couple of weeks ago and he pointed this out to me because i had a misconception about this  it s not that their underwriting is that as profitable as we make it out to be  it said their costs are much better  there s two components to underwriting margin  there s the money that you re paying up for claims  that s called your loss ratio and there s the money that you re paying for the rest of your business  how to pay your employees  to pay your offices and things like that  that s your expense ratio  can put them together  it s called your combined ratio  so kinsale has a very low combined ratio  but it s more because of that expense ratio side of it than it is the underwriting side of it  so their underwriting is roughly 10 percent points more probably not that their expenses are roughly 10 percent points lower than their peer group and that s what s their very price competitive is really the point that their ceo wanted to make to me is that their price competitive  it s not that no one else is underwriting these policies for small companies  they can undercut everyone else because they have a low cost structure  they automate most of their underwriting process  they have a proprietary technology platform that they view as their core competency and it allows them to be more profitable efficient on an expense basis than their peers mary long  you mentioned early on that the market share in the specialty insurance business doesn t quite tell the whole story here  so i ll throw out some numbers just in case they were missed  but last i checked kinsale has about one and a half percent of the excess and surplus market which is what we re talking about often when we say specialty insurance  that basically means think of a weird or obscure business and act throwing business of marijuana dispensary that thing and that fits into the excess and surplus category  so kinsale has one and a half percent of that market  markel has closer to 5 6 percent  that sounds like a small number  but that makes it i think the third largest insurer in the industry  so that in mind  how do we think about these two competitors  is it a growth story  if we re trying to pick the better company here  is it only one that we should be betting on or is it more about growth story  how do you think about this yet matt frankel  yes  so it s a very fragmented business  as you mentioned the number three has like a 5 percent market share and i think that number is one and two are lloyd s and aig that are especially insurance and you re right  it is the same insurance that you would buy for your home or for your car  but in situations where most insurers wouldn t want to touch it like the astora business or if you re a hollywood stuck man like life insurance that normal metlife might say no  we don t really want to touch that  but that s where a specialty insurer comes in  so when it comes to smaller accounts  there s less competition  it s not really an apples to apples thing  but at the same time  another thing there kinsale ceo mikey hub pointed out to me  there s a lot more small accounts than you would think  it was something like 80 percent of the e s market  so i do think of them as competitors  but at the same time i think there s enough room for everybody for more than one big winner here to disrupt what i call the traditional players or the lloyd s to aig  berkshire has a big specialty insurance business  those are what i think of as their traditional players and there s room for both kinsale and markel to disrupt them ricky mulvey  as always  people on the program may have interest in the stocks they

                        "Elon Musk became the latest billionaire to jump to Donald Trump’s defense on Friday following the former president’s conviction of falsifying business records in relation to hush-money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels.The Tesla CEO fired off a post on X early Friday morning, calling the decision “motivated by politics, rather than justice,” and warning that a conviction over “such a trivial matter” did serious damage to the public's faith in the American legal system.The comment was posted in response to another X user lamenting that the first felony conviction of an American president was for a “$130,000 payment for a porn star’s NDA,” rather than “illegal CIA coups, drone striking weddings, or spying on Americans.”Indeed, great damage was done today to the public’s faith in the American legal system.If a former President can be criminally convicted over such a trivial matter – motivated by politics, rather than justice – then anyone is at risk of a similar fate. https://t.co/zrHCyIZazh— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 31, 2024The day before, hedge fund CEO Bill Ackman weighed in on the verdict as well, decrying it as politically motivated.Following a post on X by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis calling the verdict “a testament to the political debasement of the justice system in places like New York City,” Ackman chimed in that “any objective person would have to agree with Gov. Ron DeSantis here.” Musk also replied to the Florida governor’s post with an affirmative “well said.”Today’s verdict represents the culmination of a legal process that has been bent to the political will of the actors involved: a leftist prosecutor, a partisan judge and a jury reflective of one of the most liberal enclaves in America—all in an effort to “get” Donald Trump.That…— Ron DeSantis (@GovRonDeSantis) May 30, 2024Trump himself has also railed against the decision, declaring in a statement following the verdict that the trial was “rigged” and referring to himself as a “very innocent man.” He plans to appeal the decision.On Wednesday, the Wall Street Journal reported that Musk and Trump have had preliminary talks about an advisory position for Musk should the former president win a second term. Though the role might never materialize, Musk would potentially have sway in the White House on matters of border security and the economy. Musk and Trump have had a rocky relationship at best, but appear to have grown closer in recent years as the Tesla CEO has vigorously railed against Biden and Democrats. In 2022, Musk commented that Biden was “a sock puppet” and said that he would no longer support the Democratic Party. Just this month he denounced the Biden administration’s decision to place tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles.

                        'It’s shaping up to be another great year for investors, with the market building on last year’s gains amid continued positive sentiment. The artificial intelligence (AI) theme continues to be the dominant story, with many large-cap tech companies enjoying tailwinds.Still, the year hasn’t been as positive for all, including Tesla TSLA, Intel INTC, and Starbucks SBUX, whose shares have lagged considerably.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBut is the selling overdone? Let’s take a closer look at how each company stacks up. Tesla Shares Down Almost 30%Down nearly 30% in 2024, Tesla shares have faced a bumpy road, with lower margins and hybrid momentum negatively affecting performance. Analysts have noted the headwinds, lowering their earnings expectations across the board.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStill, shares saw a pop post-earnings following its latest release despite Tesla posting numbers that came in below consensus expectations. Concerning key metrics, TSLA produced over 433,000 vehicles and delivered approximately 387,000 throughout the period.Below is a chart illustrating the company’s gross margin on a trailing twelve-month basis.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company’s unfavorable earnings outlook will likely continue weighing on share performance, but it continues to focus on cost-cutting exercises to increase operational efficiency. In addition, it’s worth noting that TSLA is part of the AI theme, spending $1 billion on AI infrastructure CapEx throughout its latest period to support autonomous driving efforts. Intel Earnings Forecast Flat YOYLike TSLA, Intel has also suffered negative earnings estimate revisions, with the stock presently carrying a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Soft margin and revenue expectations announced for its current period spooked investors, causing shares to see post-earnings pressure following its latest release.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company has faced operational issues for some time, with the stock not participating in the AI trade. It’s reasonable to expect shares to continue trading unfavorably until positive earnings estimate revisions begin rolling in, which would likely be sparked by a robust set of quarterly results.Below is a chart illustrating the company’s revenue on an annual basis. Please note that the last value is on a trailing twelve-month basis.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe valuation picture for Intel also seems a bit rich, with shares trading at a 28.7X forward earnings multiple (F1). The company’s earnings are forecasted to be flat year-over-year on +2.7% revenue growth, with the stock also carrying a Style Score of ‘F; for Value.Story continues Starbucks Facing Pressure in ChinaSlowing business in China has remained a thorn in the company’s side, with China comparable store sales falling 11% on an 8% decline in average ticket in its latest period. North American and U.S. comparable store sales also showed weakness, 3% lower, but did see a 4% increase in average ticket.Concerning headline figures in the print, SBUX fell short of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate by 14% and posted sales 6.3% below expectations. Both items were down from the year-ago period, with sales of $8.5 billion down 2%.The company’s current earnings outlook reflects the headwinds, with the stock presently carrying a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNonetheless, the company remains confident, with the CFO stating, “While it was a difficult quarter, we learned from our own underperformance and sharpened our focus with a comprehensive roadmap of well thought out actions making the path forward clear.” Bottom LineWhile many stocks have enjoyed positivity in 2024, not all have seen the same, including Tesla TSLA, Starbucks SBUX, and Intel INTC.All three have underperformed notably year-to-date, with each also carrying a negative earnings picture. Shares of each will likely continue to face near-term pressure until positive earnings estimate revisions begin rolling in, which would reflect a notable change in sentiment.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

                        'Two influential advisory firms have urged shareholders to vote against Elon Musk’s contentious $51 billion pay package and raised concerns about the CEO’s numerous side projects.On Friday, Institutional Shareholder Services called the package “excessive” and noted that shareholder concerns “have not been sufficiently mitigated” since the package was first approved in 2018.While recognizing Tesla’s growth and profitability, ISS said Musk’s pay package — first approved in 2018 and thrown out by a judge in January — “was considered outsized from the start” and has “failed to accomplish certain of the board’s stated objectives,” including focusing Musk “more closely on the Tesla organization, as opposed to his other businesses.”That warning came a few days after Glass Lewis, another prominent advisory firm, published a 71-page report that criticized the size of the compensation plan and warned about Musk’s “slate of extraordinarily time-consuming projects” that are unrelated to Tesla, such as X, the company formerly known as Twitter.Musk pushed back against the Glass Lewis report on Wednesday, telling shareholders in a letter that the firm “omits key considerations, uses faulty logic, and relies on speculation and hypotheticals.” The letter urges shareholders to approve the pay package as well as the board’s proposal to formally move Tesla’s headquarters to Texas from Delaware.The move to Texas, where Musk also operates SpaceX, was proposed shortly after a Delaware Chancery Court judge sided with Tesla shareholders who challenged the legality of the 2018 pay package.Those shareholders also argued that the directors on Tesla’s board were not truly independent and were too close to Musk to protect shareholders’ interests.The board is putting the same 2018 package up for a revote at Tesla’s annual shareholder meeting on June 13.For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com',

Here's why.Video TranscriptThese pay packages and compensation.They're just, they're, they're amazing.Go I mean, we we can talk about, you know, Elon Musk and that pay package, you know, Larry Ellison, who is friends with Elon Musk Forbes saying his net worth jumped 15 billion.Story continuesIs that what it just jumped?15 billion is oracle of course, hit an all time high this week.It's just, I'm just jaw dropping numbers go with them.Have we ever seen a moment in time like this before?With this kind of with these kind of numbers?Probably the uh so this kind of numbers.No, because you have to correct for inflation, right?But correcting for inflation, the parallel would be the gilded age.I'll just know for example that when standard oil was at its peak, if you correct for inflation, John D Rockefeller had an income, not a wealth and income, well, in excess of $20 billion a year, right.Sort of even Elon Musk would go, wow, that is a lot of fun.It's good to be the king.Yeah, it's good to be the king.Yeah, especially what um so we have seen eras like this but right, what's worth noting is when we see eras like this, there is always a correction, right?The gilded age was followed by an age of the progressive era, ages of reform when you are in the United States where median income has basically stagnated for about 45 years.I think people are gonna push back and say, does it make a lot of sense for however valuable you might think a CEO is, they're probably so, you know, let's put this in context.Um I think the top five hedge fund managers got paid more than every public school teacher in the United States combined.Ok.So you can believe that hedge funds are amazing.You can believe they're valuable.You can believe that these are the five greatest investors who've ever lived.And I would still say that the value they created for the economy is not as much as the entire American public school system put together that is not a plausible order.And so it would not be surprising for society to push on that and say it is time for there to be a reform movement to get this under to to get this rebalance in a way that's healthier for the rest of us and the council I give to all of the, all of these people is like if you push the system too far, it will break in ways that you do not like, right, you are better off leading by pushing reform and saying, let's make life better for everybody than you are pushing the system to its limits.So Gotham, um, is this the top, was this Elon pay package the top or the one that he's about to get?Maybe if he asks for even a bigger one, is that the tipping point?Well, presumably if he asks for a bigger one, he's gonna have to like generate the same kind of returns that he has that he did before.Given Tesla's current Mar market cap right in the, in almost half a trillion dollars, doing another 10 X gets you into a set of a set of calculations about where its valuation comes from.But that's a stretch, right?That's gonna be hard to do.It's gonna be even even for Elon Musk, that's a big one.What I would say is, I don't know where the breaking point will come because it'll be too like, it will take us all by surprise, but you can tell that it is coming, right?The United States is currently consumed by a gigantic populist revolt.Some parts of that are clearly about income inequality, even if it has manifested in the role of a political candidate who's, you know, I just got away from promising CEO S that he was going to cut their taxes just a couple of days ago.Um There are gonna be responses to this and we should really be thinking about how to channel that in a way that's productive and not unproductive for society.Um, if I were Elon Musk, I would sort of be saying, like I have done the impossible, right.Which there's, you know, like give him credit.He has done the impossible with his companies.But my, when we look at again, think back to John D Rockefeller, he was the most hated man in America when he was the wealthiest.Right.What he did to rebuild his reputation was to create the Rockefeller Foundation and sort of distribute that wealth to the people in ways that were, that left, completely transformed his legacy.Um I think, well, I personally am a huge fan of the space business.I think that Elon's goal of like building out the space industry is laudable.I suspect that's not gonna be enough given his other behaviors and the way, the way in which he's alienating a lot of people.",

                        "Back in April, Tesla CEO Elon Musk made a bold prediction about the future of the car industry. During the company's earnings call, Musk proclaimed that at some point, \"all cars will need to be smart cars.\"One of the major features of a smart car is that the vehicle has the ability to drive itself.Today, cars come equipped with a number of sensors and cameras that are constantly gathering information about traffic patterns, driving speeds, neighborhood layouts, and more. This information is stored and processed by car companies, which use it to train their autonomous driving software models.Luminar Technologies (NASDAQ: LAZR) develops sensors that use lidar -- pulsed laser light -- to \"see\" and create 3D maps of what's around them. Lidar is increasingly being adopted as a key component of autonomous driving systems.Despite the company's role in developing an emerging and important technology, shares of Luminar have cratered by roughly 75% over the last year. Has that created a smart opportunity to buy the dip?A look underneath Luminar's hoodYou might recall that a few years ago, a significant number of businesses went public via mergers with special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs). SPACs briefly captured the attention of retail investors in particular because many of the companies that were taking that path to the market were high-profile start-ups that looked to have potentially lucrative prospects.In reality, many of those SPACs bought businesses that had not yet scaled and were still burning cash heavily. Yet the marketing surrounding SPAC stocks gave the impression that these were once-in-a-lifetime opportunities. As a result, a lot of unsophisticated investors poured into SPACs at puffed-up valuations.The table below breaks down the long-term returns of SPAC stocks across a number of industries adjacent to that of Luminar.IndustrySPAC Stocks' Median Return (2009-Present)Electric vehicles(94.7%)Technology(87.8%)Transportation(72.2%)Data source: SPAC InsiderSince Luminar went public, its return has been negative 83%, squarely within the pattern shown in the table above. Although Luminar's technology is exciting, the company has little to show for its hefty investments in research and development so far.Image Source: Getty Images.The long-term outlook is cloudyOver the last 12 months, Luminar's operating expenses have topped $460 million, yet it has generated only $76 million in sales. That doesn't bode well for the prospects of it generating long-term sustained profits.Story continuesLAZR Revenue (TTM) ChartOn top of this, some of the notes in Luminar's Securities and Exchange Commission filings should give investors trepidation about the company's progress. Specifically, 69% of Luminar's Q1 revenue came from just three of its customers. That creates an extreme degree of customer-concentration risk.To add even more doubt to the picture, Luminar's biggest customer is Tesla -- which accounted for 48% of revenue in the first quarter. While this might look like a serious nod of approval on the surface, there are a few glaring reasons for concern.First, Musk has gone on the record as not being a supporter of lidar. Second, when Luminar's management was questioned by analysts about its relationship with Tesla during the first-quarter earnings call, their answers left much to be desired.\"I don't think we're in the best position to talk about, what they're [Tesla] doing with our lidar,\" CEO Austin Russell said. \"This isn't the first time that they've ordered lidar from us, but I would say it's been more lumpy than recurring.\" He followed this up by saying \"we can only speculate\" about what Tesla is doing with those lidar sensors.It's not a good thing when a company's largest customer is inconsistent about its purchases. It's equally unnerving that Luminar does not know why Tesla is buying its products and how they are being used.Is Luminar stock a good buy right now?Like many SPAC stocks, I think Luminar benefited from some positive sentiment surrounding the potential of its technology as opposed to the fundamentals of the business.I wouldn't go as far as to say that lidar sensors are commoditized, but Luminar is far from the only company developing such products. Considering that it's booking only nominal sales, has a hefty cash burn, operates in a fiercely competitive market, and has a high degree of customer concentration, I can see little reason to buy this stock.Should you invest $1,000 in Luminar Technologies right now?Before you buy stock in Luminar Technologies, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Luminar Technologies wasn’t one of them.

                        "Even as inflation gradually cools off, there is one price rise affecting corporate America that knows no end in sight—the ever-rising cost of paying top executives.Despite more than a decade of controversy, median CEO compensation at the 500 largest S&P companies increased at its highest pace in at least 14 years in 2023 according to figures from Institutional Shareholder Services cited by the Financial Times on Sunday.The debate over high CEO pay in America has raged for years, as proponents argue the free market sets the level while critics claim it is untethered from reality given that U.S. executives' peers in fellow industrialized nations earn a fraction of what they take home.Data from Equilar published earlier this month declared Jon Winkelreid from private equity firm TPG the best-paid executive in America, taking in nearly $200 million in total compensation, while the top five in its ranking all earned a minimum of $150 million each. Many Americans are no longer willing to countenance these kind of rewards, as wages adjusted for inflation stagnated for decades before the recent bout of high inflation both pushed up wages and strained their finances.This controversy has taken on new dimensions amid Elon Musk’s campaign to “restore Tesla’s stockholder democracy” by ratifying his 2018 pay package. Comprised of stock options with deeply discounted strike price, it’s worth on balance nearly $8 billion per year.A decade ago the late vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, Charlie Munger, pushed back against the idea that massive pay was sometimes justified in order to sufficiently incentivize executives.“Do you really think that a man who craves power and significance, likes decision-making and running a big company, has one of the important public ranks in America and makes $5 million a year—do you really think he would work a lot more effectively if you raise him to seven?” Munger told CNN in 2014. “I think the whole thing is insane.”By comparison, Berkshire’s CEO, Warren Buffett, earned only $100,000 in annual salary over the past 40 years with total compensation barely reaching the half-million mark, SEC filings analyzed by Business Insider showed in December.Board directors and high CEO payMunger argued the system had an inherent flaw: With high compensation for non-executive directors in exchange for their cushy and lucrative seats on corporate boards, these individuals were often happy to grant ever larger CEO compensation deals—“a daisy chain of reciprocity,” as he saw it.Story continuesOne such person who could fit Munger's characterization is Robyn Denholm, who attested in court to the “life-changing” wealth she accumulated as the chair of Tesla’s oft-maligned board full of Musk’s friends and family.Over the past month, the Australian emerged from her role in the background to mount a veritable media blitz lobbying for CEO Elon Musk’s pay deal—dubbed the largest in human history.In 2018, shareholders granted the board’s request to give Musk the right to purchase up to 304 million shares for a price of $23.34 each—which in theory would net him $47 billion were he to exercise the options and subsequently sell the stock at its current $178 price—if the company hit over a dozen targets ranging from market capitalization to revenue and earnings. Every single one was met, according to Tesla, amply rewarding shareholders—of which Musk is by far the biggest.This package was declared null and void in January by a Delaware court due to the fact that Denholm and her fellow directors allowed Musk to set the terms himself. This lenient board governance, however, left the very real possibility that he effectively would not be rewarded at all for his past six years of labor.As chair responsible for the situation, Denholm argued it was only fair shareholders re-approve Musk's pay in last week’s crunch vote. “Put yourself in his shoes,” she urged earlier this month. \"[It's] really about fairness—fairness to our CEO.\"The asset management company T. Rowe Price—one of Tesla's top 10 investors—followed a similar line in a statement before the vote: \"It is not reasonable for investors to…consider all that value creation to have been delivered to us for no consideration.\"Whether it was their arguments or fear that Musk might resign without a clear succession plan, nearly three in four votes cast by disinterested shareholders followed Denholm's wishes and approved the plan again.Musk’s pay may be an outlier, but the trend towards massive CEO pay in the U.S. has been clear for years. The latest annual figures from trade union AFL-CIO revealed the average CEO at the 500 largest S&P companies hauled in $16.7 million in 2022. That means it would take workers 272 years to make what their chief executives earn annually.By comparison, an analysis of 328 European and U.K. blue chips by executive compensation consultants WTW, formerly Willis Towers Watson, showed that their CEOs' pay rose 7% to almost €4 million last year—a sizable sum, but a small fraction of their U.S. peers'.This story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

                        "(Reuters) - Tesla shareholders will vote on June 13 to ratify CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package that was voided by a Delaware judge in January. Also coming up is the re-election of directors, including Musk's younger brother, Kimbal. Usually seen posing in a cowboy hat, Kimbal's bio on the Tesla website says he is an entrepreneur, activist and a chef.HERE ARE A FEW FACTS ABOUT HIM:* Born a year after Elon Musk, Kimbal grew up in South Africa with his brother before moving to Canada to pursue a business degree at Queen's University. He turns 52 this year.* His net worth was estimated to be $700 million in 2021, according to Forbes. He owns nearly 2 million shares of Tesla, worth about $348.7 million, according to the company's proxy filing and the closing share price on Thursday.* Kimbal Musk was a director of SpaceX from 2002, when it was founded, to January 2022, according to Tesla's latest proxy filing. He served on Chipotle Mexican Grill's board between 2013 and 2019.* One of the early business collaborations between the brothers was internet enterprise software firm Zip2 Corp, which they co-founded in 1995. It was acquired by Compaq for a reported $307 million, according to the New York Times, and merged into Yahoo Maps in 1999.* Kimbal had also invested in his brother's online financial services firm X.com, which merged with PayPal.* A graduate of the French Culinary Institute in New York City, he co-founded The Kitchen Restaurant Group in 2004 that has restaurants across the United States. He is also the author of \"The Kitchen Cookbook: Cooking for Your Community\".* In 2010, Kimbal became the executive director of Big Green, a non-profit organization that creates learning gardens in schools across the U.S. In 2022, he launched a drone light shows company, Nova Sky Stories, with 9,000 light drones.* He co-founded an indoor farming platform Square Roots in 2016.* In 2010 he broke his neck while skiing at the age of 37 that left him hospitalized for months. He called it a \"near death experience\", according to media reports.(Compiled by Sayantani Ghosh in San Francisco and Jaspreet Singh in Bengaluru; Editing by Aditya Soni and Arun Koyyur)",

                        'Tesla’s controversial CEO Elon Musk, and his massive wealth, are front and center in a shareholder vote this coming week.Five months ago, a Delaware judge threw out the largest pay package in history, then worth more than $50 billion, that Telsa’s very friendly board had given Musk in 2018. Now, Musk and the board want Tesla shareholders not only to vote again to give him back those stock options, but to relocate Tesla away from the judge’s state entirely.And his board is threatening if they don’t do so, they won’t get the attention they need from Musk to turn around a company facing its greatest trouble in several years. Tesla’s stock price slid by more than half from its peak as a trillion-dollar company in late 2021. Its sales fell short of forecasts and promises. Its profits are squeezed by a global price war for EVs that it started itself.The answer will come Thursday, when Tesla holds its annual shareholders meeting and announces results of shareholder votes on two proposals. One would once again approve the package of 303 million split-adjusted stock options, worth $46.9 billion as of Friday’s closing price. That’s down from the $51 billion those options were worth at the time of the decision.The shareholders approved the package back in 2018, with 73% voting in favor of it. But Delaware Chancery Court Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick in January ruled in favor of shareholders who challenged the package. She wrote that the company’s board “bore the burden of proving that the compensation plan was fair, and they failed to meet their burden.”McCormick said that process the Tesla board used to create the pay package was “deeply flawed” and criticized the board for being to close to the famous CEO to represent the interests of the shareholders.“Musk launched a self-driving process, recalibrating the speed and direction along the way as he saw fit,” she wrote.Musk and Tesla reacted by appealing the ruling, and by seeking permission from shareholders to move the company’s state of incorporation from Delaware to Texas, where its headquarters is located. Many major companies are incorporated in a different state from where their main offices are located, often in Delaware, which has a reputation for being business friendly. It was because of Tesla’s incorporation in Delaware that McCormick was able to rule on the fairness of the pay package.Despite the widespread support among shareholders back in 2018 for Musk’s pay package, the Tesla board seems to be scrambling to shore-up support for this month’s vote. It has filed with the SEC more than two dozen communications with shareholders advocating for a yes vote, far more active than most companies are when seeking shareholder approval of their proxy items. It has even opened a lottery in which the winning shareholder who casts a vote gets a tour of Tesla’s Texas factory conducted personally by Musk.Story continuesHolding Musk’s focusTesla’s filings to shareholders argue it must keep the pay package in place to keep Musk fully engaged running Tesla and not one of his other companies.“This is obviously not about the money,” Tesla Chair Robyn Denholm wrote in a letter to shareholders. “We all know Elon is one of the wealthiest people on the planet, and he would remain so even if Tesla were to renege on the commitment we made in 2018. Elon is not a typical executive, and Tesla is not a typical company.”Rather, she continued, it’s about “what will motivate him to continue to create value for stockholders,” she wrote.“What we recognized in 2018 and continue to recognize today is that one thing Elon most certainly does not have is unlimited time,” Denholm wrote. “Nor does he face any shortage of ideas and other places he can make an incredible difference in the world. We want those ideas, that energy and that time to be at Tesla, for the benefit of you, our owners. But that requires reciprocal respect.”But part of the problem with winning support is that Musk is far more controversial than he was in 2018, and appears to be far less focused on simply running Tesla.He famously bought social media platform Twitter for $44 billion in 2022, selling $22.9 billion of his Tesla shares to help fund that purchase. He has even been accused of improperly selling $7.5 billon of those shares late that year knowing that Tesla was due to soon report disappointing sales that would reduce Tesla’s price.Under his management of Twitter, since rebranded X, he’s restored accounts for users who had been banned for hate speech, advocacy of violence or misinformation. Meanwhile, allegations about widespread antisemitism on the platform, and Musk’s own endorsement of antisemitic tweets, has driven away many advertisers and caused widespread losses.But perhaps a more serious concern among Tesla shareholders is problems faced by the electric car pioneer itself. While shares shot up more than 1,700% between when the original package was approved in 2018 and its high point in November 2021, making Musk the richest person in the world at that time, it has lost more than half of that value since, including a 30% drop this year.Tesla has been forced to cut prices in the face of weaker than forecast demand for sales, and increased competition from other automakers offering their own EVs.“This shareholder vote is happening at the most tenuous time for Musk,” said Dan Ives, tech analyst with Wedbush Securities and an analyst who is still bullish on Tesla shares. “After Tesla went through a Cinderella ride, it’s become a horror show. There’s a group of shareholders who are frustrated. And this is a shot across the bow for them to show they’re not satisfied.”While Ives thinks that the pay package will again be approved by shareholders in the current vote, he said it will be a much closer vote this time. He said despite Tesla’s problems and the controversy swirling around Musk, many shareholders believe keeping him at the company, and focused on Tesla more than SpaceX, his new artificial intelligence company xAI, The Boring Company, Neuralink and his rebranded social media company X, or his other ventures, is crucial for the company’s future.Musk has even said he would not want to grow Tesla to become a leader in artificial intelligence and robotics, as he has promised, without a compensation plan that would give him ownership of around 25% of the company’s stock. That would be about double the roughly 13% stake he currently owns.“It comes down to Musk,” Ives said. “Musk is still the hearts and lungs of the Tesla growth story.”Supporters, opponents to Musk optionsSome high profile shareholders have spoken out in favor of Musk ahead of the vote, including Ron Baron, CEO of Baron Capital, which has Tesla as one of its top holdings with a stake worth more than $2 billion in the company.“Elon’s compensation contract contained aggressive performance metrics that few in 2018 believed could be achieved. If these aggressive performance metrics had not been achieved, Elon would have received nothing,” Baron said in a recent statement. “When Tesla achieved targeted earnings, revenues, and market cap metrics, Tesla’s shareholders benefitted greatly. He performed under his compensation contract. He earned his pay. Elon is the ultimate ‘key man.’ Without his relentless drive and uncompromising standards, there would be no Tesla.”But there are also high profile opponents of the deal including Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis, two firms that advise investors on how to vote on proxy proposals. Both are urging no votes on Musk’s package.“The award value was considered outsized from the start,” wrote ISS. “Some investors may find the board’s argument compelling, that it would be unfair for CEO Musk not to receive the award. However, the concerns raised, both back in 2018 and in the interim, have not been sufficiently mitigated.”In her decision throwing out the original package, McCormick rejected the argument that Musk would be uncompensated if the package was thrown out, writing, “Musk’s preexisting equity stake provided him tens of billions of dollars for his efforts.”And it could continue to be up to the courts in Delaware to decide if Musk gets the options restored, no matter how the shareholders vote this month, and whether or not they approve incorporating in Texas.The attorneys for Tesla have told the court in Delaware that the companies’ desire to move its incorporation to Texas is not an effort to evade jurisdiction from the original court order in Delaware as that case is appealed.But the outcome of the vote could decide how much Musk wants to continue to be involved with Tesla, the company that made him so rich and so famous before he became so controversial.For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com',

                        "Even though the median U.S. CEO pay package last year was nearly 200 times more than a worker in the middle of their company pay scales, Elon Musk's record-setting Tesla compensation dwarfs them by comparison.Tesla shareholders on Thursday voted overwhelmingly in favor of restoring Musk's 10-year pay plan, valued by the company in April at $44.9 billion. It was worth more early in the year, but Tesla's stock value has fallen about 25% since then.The all-stock package, approved by the board and shareholders in 2018, rewards Musk for hitting milestones that include raising Tesla's market value, pretax income and revenue.It had been tossed out by a Delaware judge in January who said the process for approving it was “deeply flawed.” The court ruled that Musk controlled the company's board, and shareholders weren't fully informed.But the company said Musk deserves the pay because he turned Tesla into the top-selling electric vehicle maker in the world, increasing its market value by billions.Even with the reapproval vote, Musk won't get access to the stock options just yet. Tesla is expected to ask the judge to revisit her decision in light of the vote, and if she doesn't, the company probably will appeal the ruling to Delaware's Supreme Court. The whole process could take months.No matter the outcome, Musk's package — the largest award to a CEO of a U.S. public company — is far above what's been granted to other chief executives. Here's how the package compares:WITH THE MEDIAN CEO PAYThe median pay package for an S&P 500 U.S. CEO last year was $16.3 million, according to data analyzed for The Associated Press by Equilar. If you multiply that by 10 to get $163 million for a decade of work, Musk's earnings still would be 275 times greater.In her January ruling that struck down the package, Delaware Chancellor Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick wrote that Musk's package, then worth about $56 billion, was 250 times larger than the median peer CEO's pay plan.WITH INDIVIDUAL CEOSThe top earner in the AP's survey was Hock Tan, CEO of artificial intelligence company Broadcom Inc. His package, mostly consisting of stock awards, was valued at about $162 million, when given to Tan at the start of fiscal 2023. Thanks to a surging stock price, Broadcom in March valued Tan’s pay package, plus older options he hadn’t yet cashed in, at $767.7 million. That's an amount easily eclipsed by Musk’s potential haul of 304 million shares worth almost $45 billion.Other CEOs at the top of AP's survey are William Lansing of Fair Isaac Corp, ($66.3 million); Tim Cook of Apple Inc. ($63.2 million); Hamid Moghadam of Prologis Inc. ($50.9 million); and Ted Sarandos, co-CEO of Netflix ($49.8 million).Story continuesTechnically, Musk got no compensation last year because he didn't get any stock options. But he stands to get even richer if his pay package goes through.WITH TESLA WORKERSIt's difficult to calculate what Musk's annual pay would have been last year. The company says he got nothing. But if his compensation package makes it through the courts, his pay will be in the billions. According to the company's proxy filing this year, the median annual pay of a non-CEO Tesla employee last year was $45,811.",

                        "Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) saw incredible demand for its electric cars over the last decade, and that success translated into life-changing returns for shareholders who were fortunate to get in early. A $10,000 investment just a couple of weeks before Tesla launched the Model S in June 2012 would be worth $914,010 today. It would have been worth more than $2.2 million at the stock's all-time high in October 2021.Tesla has run into some roadblocks this year. Higher interest rates made financing a new car more expensive for customers. The company continues to look for ways to trim manufacturing costs, reduce prices, and sell more cars. Here's why buying Tesla stock in 2024 could still deliver great returns.The ultimate growth stockTesla's market cap was less than $3 billion in 2012. Today, its market cap hovers around $550 billion, or 6.5 times the company's trailing-12-month revenue.Tesla posted a year-over-year decline in revenue in the first quarter as higher interest rates pressured demand, but the stock's high valuation suggests it is not done growing by a long shot.Investors are placing a high value on the shares due to Tesla's record of robust growth, and the expectation there's more to come. Over the last four years, the company's revenue surged nearly fourfold to $96 billion. That increase was the result of reaching vehicle production of 1.8 million over the last year. However, that's a small fraction of the 90-million-plus vehicles produced annually across the auto industry. Furthermore, Tesla's opportunity is larger than the consumer auto market considering its interest in robotics and robotaxis.But there are a lot of exciting things happening just within Tesla's core electric vehicle business. It has ramped up production of its 4680 battery for the Cybertruck. Efforts to manufacture its own electric car batteries could significantly improve the company's profitability while making its vehicles less expensive to produce and more affordable for consumers.Tesla's small share of the auto market coupled with management's cost-reduction initiatives means investors can look forward to more growth.Where to invest $1,000 right nowWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

They heard noises all last week that the economy was slowing. Prices were falling. Layoffs were expanding.

This is a meeting where the members of the FOMC pencil in their best guesses about where the economy and interest rates are headed.The Fed's website will report their guestimates in what's known as the dot-plot. It's not official, but investors take it very seriously.CPI and PPI demand attentionAt the same time the Fed meets to discuss policy, two big inflation reports come out: the all-important Consumer Price Index report on Wednesday and the Producer Price Index on Thursday.Story continuesThe first is increasingly controversial because its methodology is heavily weighted toward housing costs. The second measures how prices are changing on goods produced.The CPI report for May is expected to show prices rising at a 3.4% annualized rate, unchanged from April, with the core CPI at 3.5%, down a little from April.The PPI is expected to show an increase of 2.2% from May 2023.More on markets and the economyAMD fires latest shot at Nvidia in AI-chip warECB's rate cut may force Fed's handJobs and Kitties Can't Make the Market RoarWill Apple finally embrace AIApple  (AAPL)  has been noticeably quiet about climbing onto the artificial intelligence bandwagon, only promising to announce something this year.This week, the iPhone maker will hold its annual developer conference in Cupertino, Calif., and there's speculation that there may be details on Apple's AI plans.There will also be announcements of upgrades to various products and maybe a new iPhone.PC Magazine says there's talk the iOS 18 system may offer a feature that translates the spoken word into notes for the user.Apple's shares have struggled this year, up just 2.3% to $196.89 on Friday and 2.4% this past week.

                        "(Reuters) - Proxy advisory firm Glass Lewis said on Saturday it has urged Tesla shareholders to reject a $56 billion pay package for Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk, which if passed would be the largest pay package for a CEO in corporate America.The report cited reasons like the \"excessive size\" of the pay deal, the dilutive effect upon exercise and the concentration of ownership. It also mentioned Musk's \"slate of extraordinarily time-consuming projects\" which have expanded with his high-profile purchase of Twitter, now known as X.The pay package was proposed by Tesla's board of directors, which has repeatedly come under fire for its close ties with the billionaire. The package has no salary or cash bonus and sets rewards based on Tesla's market value rising to as much as $650 billion over the 10 years from 2018. The company is currently valued at about $571.6 billion, according to LSEG data.In January, Judge Kathaleen McCormick of Delaware's Court of Chancery voided the original pay package. Musk then sought to move Tesla's state of incorporation to Texas from Delaware.Glass Lewis also criticized the proposed move to Texas as offering \"uncertain benefits and additional risk\" to shareholders.Tesla has urged shareholders to reaffirm their approval of the compensation.In an interview this month, Tesla's board chair Robyn Denholm told the Financial Times that Musk deserves the pay package because the company hit ambitious targets for revenue and its stock price.Musk became Tesla CEO in 2008. In recent years, he has helped improve results, taking the company to a $15 billion profit from a $2.2 billion loss in 2018 and seven times more vehicles have been produced, according to an online campaign website, Vote Tesla.The proxy advisor also recommended shareholders vote against the reelection of board member Kimbal Musk, the billionaire' s brother while former 21st Century Fox CEO James Murdoch re-election was recommended.(Reporting by Urvi Dugar in Bengaluru; Editing by David Gregorio)",

                        'Most bosses are defeating attempts so far this year to tamp down their pay.The question now is whether Tesla CEO Elon Musk can do the same.Just two companies out of 340 that held shareholder votes on CEO pay as of June 6 had their executive pay packages rejected, according to ISS-Corporate, a business that is separate from the ISS unit that recommends votes for or against such proposals.That failure rate of 0.6% is lower than any full year since 2020, when pay rejections ranged from 2% to nearly 5% of all companies holding such votes.No pay vote in 2024 has received more public attention than the one happening June 13 at Tesla, where shareholders will decide whether the boss gets to keep a record-breaking $56 billion compensation package that was awarded in 2018 and then voided this year by a Delaware judge.Critics say the outsized compensation should be voted down, given that it eclipses the highest US CEO pay last year 300 times over and would dilute shareholder value. It received support from 73% of Tesla\'s independent shareholders when it was first granted six years ago.Tesla CEO Elon Musk faces a critical stockholder vote June 13 on his pay. (Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP) (Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP)Top proxy advisers ISS and Glass Lewis have recommended shareholders vote against the pay package. One big shareholder, billionaire Ron Baron, has argued for approval because Musk "earned his pay."Shareholder satisfactionMusk might take some solace from the fact that many CEOs have been successful so far this year at keeping their compensation awards intact despite some pushback.This increased shareholder satisfaction with executive pay comes as compensation continues to rise. Median pay for S&P 500 CEOs jumped to $16 million in 2023 from $14 million in 2022.It may seem counterintuitive that support for these "say-on-pay" proposals is so low in 2024 amid historically high executive pay, said ISS-Corporate vice president Stephanie Hollinger."One possible explanation is that, unlike the preceding two years where the pandemic caused a shift in traditional compensation practices, fewer issuers provided one-time awards and other discretionary adjustments in 2023," Hollinger said.Two companies where CEOs kept their pay despite aggressive challenges were money management firm BlackRock (BLK) and pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca (AZN).Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock. (REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton) (REUTERS / Reuters)Roughly one-third of AstraZeneca’s shareholders opposed an 11% pay bump along with performance-based perks for CEO Pascal Soriot. Soriot’s compensation, which reached $23.5 million in 2023, had faced opposition from ISS and Glass Lewis, as well as institutional investors, over the past several years.Story continuesAt BlackRock, the vote was much closer. Just 58% of stockholders voted in favor of awards for CEO Larry Fink and other executives.The same didn’t hold true at 3M (MMM) or Zebra Technologies (ZBRA), the rare examples of companies that weren\'t able to win enough shareholder support.During 3M\'s annual stakeholder meeting last month, 54% of investors voted down management proposals to increase certain C-suite pay, including a raise for former CEO Mike Roman from $14 million to $16.4 million.ISS and Glass Lewis also put their weight behind that "no" vote, citing 3M’s ongoing legal and financial entanglements tied to "forever chemicals."At Zebra, 60% of investors said no to a bump in pay for CEO William Burns.Mike Roman, former CEO of 3M, in 2019. (Fang Zhe/Xinhua via Getty Images) (Xinhua News Agency via Getty Images)\'Motivating someone like Elon\'At Tesla, Musk’s supporters are lobbying hard in the final days before the vote June 13.Baron, the billionaire investor and prominent Tesla stockholder, wrote in an open letter asserting that Musk’s $56 billion pay package should be approved because of his accomplishments for the company and appreciation of Tesla’s stock price over the years."Elon is the ultimate ‘key man’ of key man risk," Baron wrote. "Without his relentless drive and uncompromising standards, there would be no Tesla. Especially considering how he slept on the floor of Tesla’s Fremont factory when the company was going through what he called ‘production hell!\'"Had Musk failed to satisfy the pay deal\'s escalating revenue and market cap requirements, his stock-option-based CEO compensation would have been zero.Baron noted that when Musk’s original pay package of stock and stock options was approved by shareholders in March 2018, Tesla’s market cap stood at $53.5 billion.As of June 4, Tesla’s market cap is $550.75 billion, and hit a high of $1.24 trillion in November 2021.Tesla board chair Robyn Denholm. (Alex Ellinghausen/Sydney Morning Herald via Getty Images) (Fairfax Media via Getty Images)Baron also took aim at the lawyers who successfully sued in Delaware to void Musk’s compensation, pointing out that they asked the court to approve $5.6 billion in fees paid in Tesla stock."Does anyone honestly believe the motivation of the plaintiff and his lawyers was to serve the best interests of Tesla and its shareholders?" Baron wrote.On Friday, Tesla filed court documents arguing that the shareholder\'s lawyers should instead receive as little as $13.6 million in fees.Tesla’s board chair Robyn Denholm also made her final pitch to shareholders this past week, asking them in a June 5 letter to contemplate what it takes to "motivate" Musk."If Tesla is to retain Elon\'s attention and motivate him to continue to devote his time, energy, ambition and vision to deliver comparable results in the future, we must stand by our deal," Denholm wrote."Motivating someone like Elon requires something different," she added.Alexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

                        "Norway's sovereign wealth fund operated by Norges Bank Investment Management said Saturday it will vote against Elon Musk's hefty CEO compensation package during Tesla's annual meeting on Thursday.It's the latest pushback over the size of the pay package, which was recently valued by the company at $44.9 billion, but in January had a value of about $56 billion. In May, two big shareholder advisory firms, ISS and Glass Lewis, recommended voting against the package. “While we appreciate the significant value generated under Mr. Musk’s leadership since the grant date in 2018, we remain concerned about the total size of the award, the structure given performance triggers, dilution, and lack of mitigation of key person risk,” Norges Bank Investment Management said in a statement on its website. “We will continue to seek constructive dialogue with Tesla on this and other topics.”Tesla asked shareholders to restore Musk’s pay package after it was rejected by a Delaware judge this year.The fund, called the Government Pension Fund Global, which has a .98% stake in Tesla worth $7.72 billion, voted against the package initially in 2018.The fund invests proceeds from the country’s oil and gas industry to secure pensions for future generations in Norway. It is worth 17.80 trillion Norwegian Krone ($1.67 trillion). Because of its sheer size, the fund does not reinvest all its money in Norway, or it would overheat the economy. It invests in 72 countries worldwide.The fund also plans to vote for several shareholder policies that management has recommended shareholders vote against, including a proposal to adopt a noninterference policy respecting freedom of association and collective bargaining; adopting a simple majority vote; declassifying the board of directors; and publishing reports on harassment and discrimination prevention efforts.",

                        "DETROIT (AP) — A second shareholder advisory firm has come out against reinstating a pay package for Tesla CEO Elon Musk that was voided earlier this year by a Delaware judge.ISS late Thursday joined Glass Lewis in recommending against the package, recently valued by the company at $44.9 billion but in January had a value of about $56 billion.Shareholders of the electric vehicle and solar panel company are voting on the package, with the results to be tabulated at Tesla's June 13 annual meeting.ISS said in its recommendations on Tesla's proxy voting items that Musk's stock-based package was outsized when it was approved by shareholders in 2018, and it failed to accomplish board objectives voiced at that time.The firm said that Tesla met the pay package’s performance objectives, and it recognized the company's substantial growth in size and profitability. But concerns about Musk spending too much time on other ventures that were raised in 2018 and since then have not been sufficiently addressed, ISS said.“The grant, in many ways, failed to achieve the board’s other original objectives of focusing CEO Musk on the interests of Tesla shareholders, as opposed to other business endeavors, and aligning his financial interests more closely with those of Tesla stockholders,” ISS wrote.Also, future concerns remain unaddressed, including a lack of clarity on Musk's future compensation and the potential for his pay to significantly dilute shareholder value, ISS wrote.Musk plays big roles in his other ventures including SpaceX, Neuralink and the Boring Company. Last year he bought social media platform X and formed an artificial intelligence unit called xAI.Last week the other prominent proxy advisory firm, Glass Lewis, also recommended against reinstating Musk's 2018 compensation package. The firm said the package would dilute shareholders' value by about 8.7%. The rationale for the package “does not in our view adequately consider dilution and its long-lasting effects on disinterested shareholders,” Glass Lewis wrote.But in a proxy filing, Tesla said that Glass Lewis failed to consider that the 2018 award incentivized Musk to create over $735 billion in value for shareholders in the six years since it was approved.“Tesla is one of the most successful enterprises of our time,” the filing said. “We have revolutionized the automotive market and become the first vertically integrated sustainable energy company.\"Tesla is struggling with falling global sales, slowing electric vehicle demand, an aging model lineup and a stock price that has tumbled about 30% this year.Story continuesTesla asked shareholders to restore Musk's pay package after it was rejected by a Delaware judge this year. At the time, it also asked to shift the company’s legal corporate home to Texas.Glass Lewis recommended against moving the legal corporate home to Texas, but ISS said it favored the move.California’s public employee retirement system, which holds a stake in Tesla, said it has not made a final decision on how it will vote on Musk’s pay. But CEO Marcie Frost told CNBC that as of Wednesday, the system would not vote in favor. CalPERS, which opposed the package in 2018, said it will discuss the matter with Tesla “in the coming days.”In January, Delaware Chancellor Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick ruled that Musk is not entitled to the landmark stock compensation that was to be granted over 10 years.Ruling on a lawsuit from a shareholder, she voided the pay package, saying that Musk essentially controlled the board, making the process of enacting the compensation unfair to stakeholders. “Musk had extensive ties with the persons tasked with negotiating on Tesla’s behalf,” she wrote in her ruling.In a letter to shareholders released in a regulatory filing last month, Tesla Chairwoman Robyn Denholm said that Musk has delivered on the growth it was looking for at the automaker, with Tesla meeting all of the stock value and operational targets in the 2018 package. Shares at the time were up 571% since the pay package began.“Because the Delaware Court second-guessed your decision, Elon has not been paid for any of his work for Tesla for the past six years that has helped to generate significant growth and stockholder value,” Denholm wrote. “That strikes us — and the many stockholders from whom we already have heard — as fundamentally unfair, and inconsistent with the will of the stockholders who voted for it.”Tesla posted record deliveries of more than 1.8 million electric vehicles worldwide in 2023, but the value of its shares has eroded quickly this year as EV sales soften.The company said it delivered 386,810 vehicles from January through March, nearly 9% fewer than it sold in the same period last year. Future growth is in doubt and it may be a challenge to get shareholders to back a fat pay package in an environment where competition has increased worldwide.Starting last year, Tesla has cut prices as much as $20,000 on some models. The price cuts caused used electric vehicle values to drop and clipped Tesla’s profit margins.In April, Tesla said that it was letting about 10% of its workers go, about 14,000 people.",

                        "Tesla (TSLA) shareholders approved CEO Elon Musk's controversial $56 billion compensation package, as well as other measures at Thursday's shareholder meeting. Financial analyst and YouTuber \"Meet Kevin\" Kevin Paffrath joins Market Domination to discuss the shareholder meeting and the future of the EV company under Musk's leadership.\"The shareholder vote now behind us is great news. It's a big negative catalyst away for Tesla,\" Paffrath explains. He says that Musk's vision of full self-driving (FSD) is \"probably going to be a lot safer for the entire world,\" as \"we [go] toward an autonomous future.\" However, Paffrath doubts whether it will happen as quickly as Musk suggests.Regardless, Paffrath says he's bullish on the stock in the next two to four years as the company \"still has probably the best moat in full self-driving that exists.\" Paffrath's Pricing Power ETF (PP) holds just 36,000 Tesla shares in its portfolio.Paffrath was in favor of Musk's pay package, stating, \"the deal was made in 2018 and it was very public... Frankly, if that same deal was made today at those prices then, everybody would look at that as a shareholder and go — well, at least 70% like we had then — 'Of course, we're going to support if you can move the market capitalization of this stock essentially exponentially. Of course, we're going to support paying for you.' So receiving that and then being frustrated about Elon in the short term, I don't think is fair. I think it hits on an element of justice.\"He adds that after the company started offering consumers a lower monthly payment, he expects Tesla shares to skyrocket and \"form a bottom here in delivery numbers.\"\"So really, what Elon's doing here is he's creating a bottoming process in the actual manufacturing of electric vehicles. At the same time, he's rehired back the charging team, which is great, most of them, at least. And all of the other electric vehicle companies that I'm studying — Ford (F), GM (GM) — they're all scared,\" he explains.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination.This post was written by Melanie RiehlCatch up on Yahoo Finance's coverage of all things Tesla, Elon Musk, and his pay package saga:'Don't fire Steve Jobs': Tesla analysts react to approval of Elon Musk's pay package'Hold on Tesla and wait,' don't buy right now: StrategistTesla is in 'incredibly enviable' position for real-world AITesla is biggest market bubble in world history: Short sellerDon't bet against Elon Musk: Dan Ives talks $1T Tesla callStory continuesElon Musk wins Tesla shareholder battle to keep his record-breaking payElon Musk has been integral to Tesla's growth, AI: Cathie WoodMusk's pay battle is not over.

We can be bullish on the stock in the next 2 to 4 years as Tes Tesla still has probably the best moat in full self driving that exists.It's not as big as it used to be.I'd put it at about 18 to 24 months ahead of some of the competitors.What we're seeing out of Byd in China Xing Motors, but we're definitely still ahead and Kevin, you did mention that pay package and it didn't get approved.And so I'm just curious, Kevin, is that what you expected?And, and as a, as a shareholder, is that what you supported Kevin?Yeah, it is.So I did this little tax loss harvesting event for my fund PP the pricing power ETF where uh we sold uh in mid March and then bought back in at roughly the same price in mid April, but we missed the vote deadline by one day.Uh That said I did make public that I was in favor of the vote passing and that I would vote for it if I could.Now with this book, I'm gonna ask you, Kevin how it was?Let me just get your take.Why Kevin, why did you support it?Oh, absolutely.Well, so first of all, the deal was made in 2018 and it was very public.This was like a YOLO call option for Elon to go for this.Frankly.If that same deal was made today at those prices, then everybody would look at that as a shareholder and go well, at least 70% like we had that.Of course, we're going to support if you can move the market capitalization of this stock essentially exponentially.Of course, we're going to support paying for you.So receiving that and then being frustrated about Elon in the short term, I don't think is fair.I think it, it hits on an element of justice, but we could really go into sort of AAA different world there.I don't think justice was served by what the Delaware judge conducted.Uh that said long term, we've got to look at Tesla as this is how I value it.I don't look at it as a 30 to $50 trillion humanoid optimist, you know, program look, that's great.That's wonderful.Sort of icing on the cake as a financial advisor and running A I, I can't price that in.So what I do is I look at data, I look at quarter to data bottoming.Early sales data indicates that Q two is not going to be as bad as feared.I think it's because of the financing.They finally realized that offering people a lower monthly payment just 0.99% APR in May.Now they're at 1.99.Uh in June is a sign that people are payment sensitive, not necessarily price sensitive.And I think that's actually going to help skyrocket Tesla shares and form a bottom here in delivery numbers.We already know that margins have bottomed.They're the only automotive company to have over 18% gross margins excluding the cyber truck on vehicles, especially electric vehicles.Most companies lose money on these.So really, what Elon's doing here is he's creating a bottoming process in the actual manufacturing of electric vehicles.At the same time, he's rehired back the charging team, which is great, most of them at least.And all of the other electric vehicle companies that I'm studying.Ford GM, they're all scared, they're reducing their exposure to electric vehicles.Elon is creating a massive United States electric vehicle moat for Tesla and Tesla shareholders, Kevin.If that said 11 last thing quickly, if, if China were able to sell evs here, I would not own Tesla.So you are relying on the government to protect you a bit.",

                        'Shanghai on Friday released a white list to expedite cross-border data transfers for companies that operate in its pilot free-trade zone, including electric vehicle maker Tesla, providing a much-needed boost for the country\'s efforts to retain and reel in more international business.The first batch of this "general data" list, which covers 64 categories, will enable enterprises involved in intelligent connected vehicles, publicly offered funds and biopharmaceuticals to make data transfers overseas without obtaining regulatory approval, according to a WeChat post by authorities at Lingang New Area, part of Shanghai\'s free-trade zone in Pudong district.The release of that list has made Shanghai the first city on the mainland to implement concrete local rules to expedite the flow of general data overseas, several months after it opened an industrial estate focused on the data industry.Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.Shanghai\'s three-tiered, cross-border information regime identifies "important data" as those that require security assessment by local authorities, while those classified as "core data" are prohibited from being transferred overseas.An aerial view of a construction site at Lingang New Area, part of Shanghai\'s pilot free-trade zone in Pudong district.

Photo: Xinhua>This initiative by China\'s commercial and financial hub is expected to fix a sore point for Tesla and other multinational companies under that three-tiered cross-border data flow regime.Tesla, along with 13 other automotive companies such as Porsche\'s China sales arm and SAIC Motor, formed part of the working group that drafted the general data list, according to an earlier local media report.The list would enable Tesla, which operates a vast Gigafactory in Lingang New Area, to ascertain which data can be transferred abroad without restrictions and which information must receive further scrutiny. New Lingang Area\'s post on Friday did not mention any company by name, although Tesla is expected to fall under firms involved in intelligent connected vehicles.For Tesla, user-generated data in mainland China is an important resource for the company to train its autonomous driving algorithms.Story continuesA truck transports new Tesla cars at the US carmaker\'s Gigafactory in Shanghai on May 13, 2021.

Photo: Reuters>In March, internet watchdog the Cyberspace Administration of China implemented new rules designed to ease regulation on cross-border data flows, including exemptions under certain scenarios to export data without official security assessment.That followed measures released last August by the State Council, which called for establishing "green channels" for qualified foreign companies to export data, and to roll out a list of general data that can be transferred freely across the border in Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin.Shanghai has envisioned Lingang New Area as an artificial intelligence (AI) "highland", assembling national talent and resources to help promote the free flow of data.The area\'s International Data Economy Industrial Park is tasked with "implementing safe and orderly cross-border flows of international online data", according to a policy document unveiled last October by Lingang New Area authorities. That estate would serve as home to more than 100 leading data companies, which could generate a combined output of over 100 billion yuan (US$13.8 billion) by 2025.This article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

                        "This year began with nothing but hope for shareholders of Realty Income (NYSE: O), Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) and Opendoor Technologies (NASDAQ: OPEN). Reality hasn't been as kind. All three stocks are trading lower in 2024.The bullish arguments haven't been entirely silenced; they have been deferred instead of denied. Let's take a closer look at how these three high-profile laggards can turn their downticks into upticks in 2025.1. Realty Income: Down 4%When it comes to REITs, there aren't as many \"sure things\" as Realty Income. It's just one of just three real estate investment trusts to have boosted its payouts for at least 25 years. Earlier this year, it stretched that streak to 29. It also routinely bumps its monthly -- yes, monthly -- distributions higher. It has come through with 124 hikes since 1994.A lot has happened over the past three decades. Realty Income has bucked the cyclicality. The recession-resistant nature of its portfolio helps. It owns 15,450 commercial properties worldwide that it leases to more than 1,500 different clients. It's diversified, with skin in the game of 89 different industries, but it's largest categories are noteworthy. Supermarkets, convenience stores, and dollar stores are its three largest concentrations at 10.1%, 9.5%, and 6.5% of its portfolio, respectively. These are businesses that stay steady even when the economy isn't at its best. Realty Income shines, even if the stock chart appears a bit dim right now.Image source: Getty Images.Realty Income averages four hikes a year, so it's probably not done with the payout bumps this year. The shares trading 4% lower in 2024 and down 11% over the past 12 months have only pushed the yield higher. Realty Income currently yields 5.6%.It's hard to fathom Realty Income trading lower this year if the Fed was already cutting rates as most economists figured would be the case in late 2023. Rate cuts will help Realty Income as it finances new investments. It will also make the REIT that much more attractive when the leading money market funds are also yielding north of 5%. Whether rates start moving lower in the second half of this year or into 2025, better days should be ahead for Realty Income investors.2. Tesla: Down 30%Shares of Tesla more than doubled last year, doing so despite the automaker slashing prices to the detriment of its margins and bottom line. Gravity finally caught up to Tesla. Revenue has decelerated sharply for three consecutive quarters, including an outright 9% top-line decline in its latest report.Story continuesAnalyst models that had Tesla raising prices over time for both its vehicles and its full self-driving (FSD) platform have met a reality check. Even the game-changing FSD isn't immune. Since September of last year, the up-front price has gone from $15,000 to $12,000, then slashed to $8,000 last month when its monthly subscription was halved.Expectations have been reset, and analysts have been paring back profit targets for this year and next. Lower expectations aren't a bad thing. For starters, the bar of success is now lower. Short interest is also at a nearly three-year high. The bearish narrative is loud, but the first whiff of good news can send the naysayers scrambling in a short squeeze.3. Opendoor Technologies: Down 46%It's perhaps not surprising that the biggest gainer of the three last year is now the biggest casualty. Opendoor nearly quadrupled in 2023. It has been cut almost in half this year. The iBuying market was supposed to bounce back last year, explaining why the home flipper saw its stock soar even as rising mortgage rates froze existing homeowners from giving up their properties to an iBuying specialist like Opendoor.You don't need to be a rocket scientist to figure this one out. Real estate reselling activity remains icy. Folks locked into mortgage rates at much lower than prevailing financing costs don't want to move and get less bang for their buck. Trailing revenue is less than a third of what it was when Opendoor's business peaked in 2022.Next year could be special for Opendoor. The moment home loans get substantially cheaper, there is going to be a lot of pent-up demand for folks to trade up or downsize. Opendoor offering those anxious sellers an instant offer on homes that the company can spruce up and resell is a win-win deal.Should you invest $1,000 in Realty Income right now?Before you buy stock in Realty Income, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Realty Income wasn’t one of them.

                        "With a valuation more than 6 times sales, Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) costs significantly more than rival automotive stocks like Ford and General Motors, both of which sell for mere fractions of 1 times sales. Tesla fans defend Tesla's high valuation, arguing Tesla is more than just a car company -- that its investments in artificial intelligence to power its self-driving car technology mean Tesla is really an AI company.And investors in Dell Technologies (NYSE: DELL) had better hope they're right.On Thursday, Dell won a big upgrade when investment bank Evercore ISI raised its price target on the stock from $140 to $165. As Evercore explained, its reason for upgrading Dell is because Tesla is buying much of its AI server capacity from Dell Technologies.Is Dell stock a buy?Assume Evercore is right about that. Would it mean that Dell stock is a buy at its current share price of $146? Would it mean the stock is actually worth as much as $165?In Thursday's note on StreetInsider.com, Evercore argues that Dell is winning \"a large proportion\" of Tesla contracts to supply it with servers equipped with Nvidia H100 AI computer chips. The analyst hypothesizes that server demand could add as much as $3 billion to Dell's revenue in 2024. Additionally, Evercore argues that Dell is winning orders for storage computing to support all the AI capacity it is selling, adding even more revenue growth.According to the analyst, all this computing demand from Tesla could add three or even four percentage points to Dell's five-year projected growth rate (currently just under 12%).But here's the thing: Even if Evercore is right, and Dell ends up growing, say, 16% in 2024, that still isn't fast enough growth to justify Dell's current 32.6 times trailing earnings valuation. To justify today's price (let alone Evercore's $165 target price), you'd want to see Dell growing somewhere closer to 30%. 16% growth simply isn't fast enough.Long story short, even with Tesla as a customer, Dell's growth is too slow, and its stock price is too high.Should you invest $1,000 in Dell Technologies right now?Before you buy stock in Dell Technologies, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Dell Technologies wasn’t one of them.

                        'Nio reportedly launched a more affordable electric car brand in China in a bid to gain a firmer foothold in the world’s most competitive market as Tesla momentum slipped.The brand, called Onvo, would target family users with its first model which competed directly with Tesla’s Model Y and the Toyota RAV4 SUVs, Nio chief executive officer William Li said at an event in Shanghai, according to Bloomberg.The launch vehicle, the medium size L60 SUV, was “longer, wider, and roomier than the Model Y,” he said.The report said the L60, with customer deliveries expected from September, would start at CNY219,900 (US$30,400).Bloomberg noted the Model Y started at CNY249,900 yuan in China while the most basic Nio model was priced from CNY 298,000.Bloomberg said Shanghai based Nio, which posted an annual loss of CNY20.7bn last year and failed to meet its sales target, wants to boost market share and profitability by expanding its product line while improving efficiency. While Onvo would stand apart from the Nio brand, which was positioned as a premium vehicle maker, it would share much of the same infrastructure including includes the charging network and sales and service hubs, in addition to supply chain and research and development.Onvo “has been further enabled by Nio’s capabilities and resources accumulated in the past 10 years,” Li reportedly said, adding the new brand would allow the company to reach more customers.Bloomberg said Nio deliveries fell in the first quarter of 2024 amid heightened competition and price cuts by rivals including BYD and Li Auto. Tesla, which had rolled out several rounds of price cuts in China, was also a victim. While sales of new-energy passenger vehicles rose 28% in April from a year earlier, a category that included EVs and plug-in hybrids, Tesla deliveries fell 18%.Targeting mass market users, Onvo won’t grant its owners access to Nio Houses, the exclusive lounge like spaces where owners can get free drinks and take social classes, Li reportedly said in a media briefing. The cars would come with a cheaper battery pack, reducing monthly leasing fees.The brand would also focus on “core needs,” rather than use more expensive technologies like lidar based advanced driving systems and high performance motors to increase acceleration, Bloomberg quoted Alan Ai, senior vice president of Nio and the president of Onvo, as saying.Li said the unit was expected to start contributing to Nio profitability when monthly sales reached about 20,000 vehicles.Onvo expected to launch one new model per year, with its second car targeting larger families, Bloomberg said.Story continues"Loss making Nio launches cheaper brand" was originally created and published by Just Auto, a GlobalData owned brand. The information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

                        "Markets (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) hope to solidify gains seen during this trading week and close above recent milestones: the Dow Jones Industrial Average is in a back-and-fourth bout to stay above 40,000 as the S&P 500 teeters above the 5,300 mark.BMO Capital Markets Chief Investment Strategist Brian Belski joins Catalysts Anchors Seana Smith and Madison Mills to lay out what circumstances could propel the S&P 500 above 5,600 points.As GameStop (GME) shares tank and meme stock sentiments pull back at the end of this week, Wedbush Equity Research Managing Director Michael Pachter touches on the biggest competition and headwinds for the video game retailer going forward.The Chinese government has a new strategy to revitalize its drooping property and real estate sector.Yahoo Finance's Catalysts also cover other top stocks like Tesla (TSLA), Boeing (BA) as its annual shareholders meeting is underway, Applied Materials' earnings (AMAT), and Netflix's (NFLX) streaming deal with the NFL.This post was written by Luke Carberry Mogan.Video TranscriptIt's 10 a.m. here in New York City.I'm Madison Mills alongside Shana Smith.Welcome to Catalyst it, Friday May 17th was I right into it.The catalyst that are moving markets this morning, the dow Hoing just below that critical 40,000 level milestone that we first hit yesterday as investors, we the fed path forward.Now, the doubt that it's important to point out isn't alone.You got the S and P 500 the NASDAQ also hitting record highs this week.We'll see whether or not we will get back to that 40,000 level here today.That's right.And next week, the rally facing another big test with in videos earnings.Can the chips giant deliver on the streets high expectations?And so taking another leg lower today after gamestop warns of falling sales and also plans to sell shares.This comes after a two day sell off that wiped off about $7 billion of prior games from both games.Stop and A MC.Well, first, our big story and that is markets just at record highs here today.You've got the S and P 500 just around that 5300 mark.The dow hitting 40,000 yesterday.Our next guest see more room to the upside.He's got a year end target for the S and P 500.A 5600, the highest call on the street.So let's bring him in.We've got Brian BBMO, capital markets, a chief investment strategist, Brian.It's good to see you.So you and I were talking.Not that long.You sounded a bullish for your previous target.Now you're raising why now?And what's the catalyst, Shana?Good morning, good morning, Yahoo.Um You know, a lot of people were telling or accusing us of being bearish because we said, uh in late February that the market was getting a little tippy, toppy and needed to be sideways here, especially considering the type of move that we saw.Story continuesYou know, we really believe first off that us stocks are in a 25 year secular bull market.Uh Number two, we believe that the cyclical portion of the bull market means this new cyclical bull started in October of 2022 typically.And historically, the second year of a bull market has a, has an average correction of 9.6%.Um And we didn't see that we only had like a 5% correction.And so given what we're seeing in earnings, given what we're seeing and hearing from what the Fed is gonna do.And we think equities now are becoming an increasingly important part of people's asset mixes, especially considering what's going on in the bond market in the unwind of what we'd like to call the 40 year bull market in bonds.Uh, we think that there's more upside and so it doesn't mean that stocks are gonna be linear forever.Uh, we are going to see some sort of a normal correction.Uh, and I think that's a better buying opportunity, but for now, uh, I think the screens are green and the skies are blue and we're going to have a little bit more upside here.Brian, what do you think that correction, that short term correction could look like?Well, I think it comes from a higher level.So, you know, a lot of the technicians out there use this phrase higher lows.I think this period, this year is gonna be a period of higher lows.So I think the correction comes from a little bit higher prices.And so it would be from a, from a technical perspective and from a just a pure health perspective of the market, it would be nice to um take a, take a bit of a breather here uh in the in the bull market and the upside price appreciation, take a respite, get ready for the summer into the fall.And I think uh fourth quarter in particular, especially post election will do very well.But Brian, what would the catalyst for that pullback be?I mean, this market is acting like that CP I print was the best thing it's ever seen and it really wasn't that soft.No, it wasn't.That actually is a really great, uh, point.I think that we as investors, um, have and when we've reared an entire generation of investors that only believe that stocks go up of interest rates go down.And if you think about it, we enter 2020 for meaning the stock market and the investing world thinking and believing that the FED is going to cut six times while all of a sudden that changed.And as early as 10 or 14 days ago, people were talking about the fed raising rates.And so I do think that we're transitioning quite frankly into more of a trading range environment, more of a focus on the stocks versus uh the forest through the trees.Uh Let's call it versus all this macro.So what could be the catalyst?I think for a pullback would be some sort of a near term uh scare and interest rate, some sort of a near term uh momentum change whether or not it's geopolitical or not.I don't think it's fundamental.I don't think it's fundamental is because the earnings prowess, the United States stock market is very strong, the cash flow strength is strong return on equity is strong.And we do think actually there's a portion of the market quite frankly where numbers are too low, especially namely in some concern stocks, but financial financial financials.I think an area where analysts have been too conservative in their outlook and I think a lot of earnings power will come from the financial sector.Well, Brian, let's talk about earnings.I always love to monitor mentions of things and earnings.That's always fun.Uh, pricing power mentions are down expense management mentions outpacing pricing power mentions by quite a bit here.Can companies in the S and P expense manage their way to 5600 expense managing their their way through the last 15 years for all intents and purposes, it's called under, under promise and over deliver.Uh we on Wall Street as investors or portfolio managers, which we are as well.We love it, love it, love it, love it, love it when, when companies cut costs and shut down divisions and restructure because it shows that they're having discipline.That's why if you take a look at free cash flow and you look at the operating performance, whether or not it's return on asset return on invested capital return on equity has been so strong.Um You know, we think too from the discern ability of earnings and the consistency of earnings is stronger that we've seen in prior big bull market cycles.And so to me, this reminds me a lot more of the mid nineties prior to the irrational exuberance of 1996 which oh by the way, was had nothing to do with tech stocks, had everything to do with the consumer staples area.What you're talking about pricing power, like you remember, the consumer staples um sector benefited from food inflation and their, and their earnings have been strong.Now you're starting to see those stocks roll over.That's why like a stock like Walmart, it's just a juggernaut.They've done an amazing job with their inventory in their stores and in the, in the, especially in the grocery side.Uh but that, that stock in particular, I think is kind of bucking the trend and the in a consumer staples sector by the way, which we think is increasingly expensive.And one we think you should ignore, aside from, let's say Walmart and Costco Brian, going back to where you are seeing those opportunities within the market, you mentioned financials, you've been overweight that sector.Now for some time, you're expecting that out performance here when it comes to future earnings.Where else are you seeing that opportunity and have that at all changed from when you initially came out with your S and P target for the year?No, it hasn't changed.I mean, we're right now positioned as a Barbell, right?O overweight, um technology and financials.And I think the difference with technology the second half of the year is dare I say they're not quite second tier companies, they're not, they're not Microsoft and Apple, which are really the part uh in NVIDIA, part of the, the magnificent seven which oh by the way, number seven in the magnificent seven is Hathaway.So uh so the, the financial stock is kind of snuck into that, be that as it may, I think stocks like Qualcomm and a MD and Broadcom and Oracle and Salesforce and Adobe.Um some of the second tier companies relative to the top ones like Microsoft and Apple, I think they're gonna take more buying power and more kind of increased money.I think too, that we've seen an overall broadening out of, of the market.You've seen the equal weight that S and P uh hit new highs.You've seen look at small and mid cap are doing very well as well.And I think that's the opportunity there.So I think an overall broadening out and they don't also forget um healthcare, healthcare is the second largest sector in the market.And um I think healthcare aside, so such as uh focus has been on Lily and the like which we are very fortunate to own the stock.But you know, the United Healthcare and the Mercks and the engines of the world, I think are stocks that could do very, very well.The second half of the year.All right, Brian, we're going to have to leave it there.Thank you so much for joining us.We really appreciate it.That was Brian Bell.He is BMO Capital Markets Chief Investment Strategist.Now, investors are looking ahead to in video results next week which could drive more momentum in the current market.Rally shares of video significantly outperformed the rest of the market for the last year.They are up a whopping 96% year to date.The big question though, can the chip making powerhouse deliver on lofty expectations?Joining us now on, this is our very own miles, miles.Thank you as always for being here.I mean, can they, can they pull it off?Who knows to find out?I think that, you know, in the context of what Brian was just talking about with respect to the overall market rally right now, the shape of that rally, the drivers of that rally in videos report that everyone's been eyeing for quite a long time and obviously the the structure around it, how investors expect this to factor into the overall situation that doesn't change too much.It's still a high volatility event, both for the company and I think overall, but the context in which they are reporting has changed quite a bit over the last month in that there's now much more enthusiasm from investors around what the earnings picture is going to look like, not just in this quarter but over the balance of the year.You know, as Brian was discussing the fundamental idea, like the idea that a fundamental reason to see a, you know, 910 15% pull back this year has really faded in investors minds.So I will be curious to see if NVIDIA becomes a much more specific A I trade and like, how could it be more specifically A I?But I mean, it, in the sense of all those Pullbacks we saw at the beginning of earning season, the Ts MS of the world, um, does that come back for NVIDIA?But does the market kind of move on anyway, I, I guess, put it even more plainly for the viewers just how significant this one report really is for the market.When you're talking about these growth rates that we've seen at NVIDIA also, just how unusual it is.We pointed this out in our morning brief here uh this morning at Yahoo Finance Lee, he wrote it.But when you talk about how unusual it is for this type of growth to continue when you got a company at this size.Yeah, it gets back to a conversation that sort of picked up at the end of last year, which was, are we sure that the semiconductor industry is no longer a cyclical business because it has long been a heavily cyclical business?And that, meaning there are times at which you see order growth 100% plus, I mean, NVIDIA has seen revenue grow, um and and earnings grow much more aggressively than that over the last several quarters.Um And then there's a time when you start to see a pull back, we've had a lot of cap X from the biggest tech companies already outlined, those are going to be many of Nvidia's customers.So analysts can do the math on what that implies in terms of the growth rate for the company.But we're really talking about what's 2026 look like for NVIDIA, what does 2028 look like for NVIDIA?And how much has that story changed?And you know, to Julie's point, you don't typically see again in whether it's a company of this size in video.Obviously, you know, many trillions of market cap, you know, two trillion market cap at this point.Um not only companies of that size but industries in which there is such a cyclical component to it.Um Growth rates like that continue indefinitely.All right.Well, it's clearly a story we will be covering very closely here you by miles.Amazing.Thanks so much.Another fact that we're watching today is game that we've got shares of the meme stock here falling this morning at losses of 23% of prelim results here showing a drop in first quarter sales.They also issuing here a plan to sell shares and that's really what is moved the stock here in early trading.We want to talk about all of this and what is next for gamestop and the trade a large for that we want to bring back.He's what Bush Equity research and managing director Michael.It's great to see you before we get into it just first your quick reaction to the news that we're getting out on game stop this morning.Well, I think they're pretty smart.Um, you, you definitely have to give them credit for capitalizing on the opportunity to build their war chest.Um, I'm not seeing anything in the preannouncement that tells me that the business is turning around.Uh, but at least they'll raise enough cash to last another three or four years if they, uh, if they in fact continue to flail and try to find a new strategy.So I admire that they're taking advantage of the opportunity.That's, that's probably in the best interest of their longer term shareholders.I feel sorry for the fools who buy the stock at 21 because it's worth single digits and I'll have a note out shortly.My, my targets under review.Ok.But still Michael, I mean, we saw roaring Kitty getting back on X and then that causing a little bit of this rally.I know it wasn't the only cause, but could there be another random catalyst that leads to a gamestop rally?That really isn't about the company fundamentals.Well, with, with respect to her and Kitty because he was absolutely right in 2020.Um there was a structural flaw in the holdings of gamestop.I mean, they had more than 100% of the share short and he made that obs observation, it was astute, he rallied uh retail investors, redditors, you know, reddit Raiders to, to buy into the stock.And he was right and they made, they made a movie about it and he was right.Um, now he's not actually doing anything other than posting video clips.And, you know, I, I, he, he was dormant for two or three years.He just started a frenzy of post, but they're all video clips.Only one had any reference to gamestop.It was a woman with a Gamestop logo on her dress.Um I don't know what he's saying.So sure, you know, guys posting movie clips saying it's over.What's that mean?Um If you want to buy a stock based on that, God bless you, but he has not actually said go buy Gamestop.So Mike, what do you think the next several months, several quarters look like here then for gamestop, they're going to see continued declines.Uh There's nothing big coming out this year.You know, we don't have anything incremental this year, next year, you have Grand Theft Auto but nothing big.No new consoles this year.Uh The console makers are all kind of guiding to lower expectations.Sony is looking to sell 18 million consoles.They were looking to sell 25 million before.Um the, the big news today, which is a Wall Street Journal exclusive speculation that called it duty will be on game pass.Um I can confidently tell you that anybody who's a game pass, subscriber would be an idiot to buy Call of Duty, they won't.So call of duty sales will be lower this year.It wasn't on game pass last year.And that means physical sales at gamestop will be lower because of that.So lots of, uh, of head winds for them and I don't see any way out of it.The preliminary results were actually worse than we had modeled.They did under 900 million of revenue and we had modeled a billion.That's down 25% year over year.Now, that's not all industry decline.Some of that is store closures and we don't have the detail yet, but realistically, they cannot save their way to prosperity.Their store unit economics can't get any better.You have to have an employee in the store.You can't leave it at self serve or people will steal everything and you can't not pay rent or not turn the lights on.So they're, they're done shrinking their cost structure.The only question is, can they, you know, shrink their store count and re return to profitability?I don't think so.They lost money last year.You know, they made 17 million net income with 45 million of interest income.So they lost on an operating basis by over 30 million Michael.You mentioned the news that Microsoft is reportedly planning to release the next installment of Call of Duty as a subscription service instead of the usual all car model.That's according to the wall street journal here.Do you think that that is a game changing move for Microsoft?It is, I mean, they, they, you know, game pass as a subscription service is only worth $15 a month, you know, 100 and $80 a year if you play more than 100 and $80 worth of games.So, so roughly three games a year, if you can use game pass instead of purchasing three games, it's a good deal.That's why we pay, you know, for Netflix, we pay about the same for Netflix, but we want enough content to make it feel worth its while, you know, worthwhile.Um And so Microsoft's just trying to build the content so that they have enough people view the subscription as an attractive substitute for purchasing games.Um Yes, good for Microsoft.In the long run.They won't be making money on game pass until they get to around 100 million subscribers and they're at 34 million.So the only way they're going to get to 100 million is to put premium content on there like Call of Duty.Um uh they own Call of Duty.So it's gonna cost them the sales of Call of Duty, which is also gonna cost Gamestop and they're just hoping that they get enough subscribers to, to make up the difference.They won't this year, but they might in five years and I certainly think they will intend.So they're willing to take some losses while they build the business out.I quickly want to talk to you about one other name that you cover, which is beyond, you've got an outperform on it.This includes bed bath and beyond.For anyone who may not know they obviously had their own issues and recovered to a degree.Is there any evidence that Gamestop could follow a similar path as bed bath and beyond?Uh Well, they could follow a similar path as the former, as the bankrupt debt bath and beyond.Uh follow a similar path as Marcus Lemonis led beyond.No, I don't think so.Uh I I had to look the word stand up to.It's, it's a stalker fan.That's me and Marcus.I I am absolute stan I love that guy.Um Now you, it takes a visionary retail leader like Marcus to turn a company like beyond around.Um He's buying that brands.He bought the bed Bath and Beyond brand are actually for men.He bought the Zulu brand and he's revitalizing the Overstock brand.Um I love that.I think they're gonna be kind of all by themselves and close up merchandise.They're gonna be a premium brand for home furnishings and a premium brand for toddler uh merchandise.I think that that Gamestop if they try to re invent themselves more power to them.But what's left?I mean, we've already seen Ryan Cohen do Chewy.Is he gonna try to sell dog food through the Games Stock brand.I doubt it.You know, I, I mean, for real and the gamestop brand's problem is that the substitute is not, you know, a, a different online retailer or a different physical retailer.The substitute is a digital download.Gamestop sells something you don't need to purchase physically beyond does not beyond sells stuff that you're either gonna buy at a different online retailer or you're going to go to a physical store to get, you can't digitally download a couch, just can't happen.So you can digitally download Call of Duty and Microsoft's making making it easier by letting you stream it so very easy to to not make that purchase at gamestop.No, they cannot follow in this in the path of beyond unless somehow Ryan Cohen takes his, you know, billion dollar cash balance and pays it to Marcus Limona since he's Marcus turn business R for.All right, Michael, we're going to have to leave it there.Thank you so much for joining us.We really appreciate it.That was Michael Pachter.He is Wedbush Equity Research managing director.China is unveiling plans to revitalize its property sector, the country easing mortgage rules and pushing local governments to buy unsold homes to develop more affordable housing.Now this sending China's property index shares higher in the pre market here.You can see that in the trade here.Actually, I should say, but Shana taking a step back just to go over kind of what this is the rescue package is meant to prop up the property market in China, which has really just been in shambles over the past couple of years here.This is the most urgent step that we've seen from authorities.They're going to have about $40 billion that will go to state owned entities to convert empty homes to social housing.And just to indicate kind of the context of how tough the situation has been for housing.We have data overnight from China showing that housing prices fell at their steepest levels in over a decade here.And this makes up about a quarter of China's overall economy.So a really big deal to see that struggle in the housing sector.Last thing I want to bring up is a note that we got from UBS, Paul Don in this morning.And he was basically talking about this idea that if the growth target for China is met through production output, for example, rather than domestic consumption, China could be vulnerable to trade reprisals and things like tariffs moving forward.If your economy is based on sending stuff out and then you get a lot of tariffs that could be a big headwind for China, which then is a headwind to a lot of the companies that we talk about all the time.Yeah, I think, I think the what ultimately the impact that this is going to have remains to be seen.Right.There's a lot out there, a lot of stress, just a lot of forecasters saying that clearly they're not out the woods just yet.I think that is largely the consensus at this point given the struggles that you had just been highlighting here.But the move writing 40 $42 billion of funding to buy those unsold homes.It does mark a transition or a difference in the stance that we have seen Beijing take on the property sector here in China.So it certainly is significant.What exactly this does ultimately to prop up the economy down the road.We are starting to see that recovery gain a bit of traction in China.But again, the data continues to be mixed.We did see some pressure on the latest consumer data coming out and then you take a look at the industrial numbers actually and they showed they pointed to a sign of strength there and we're seeing that play out in some of the commodity trading, especially oil, that movement to the upside here that we are seeing today.So again, remains to be seen, certainly a story to watch here.And more broadly speaking, the impact that this could potentially have on China's economy and that recovery.And what exactly that means ultimately here for the global markets.All right.Well, coming up Boeing's annual meeting is in less than an hour, we will speak to a shareholder of Boeing to get his take on what to expect and what he wants to hear from Boeing.We'll be right back.Let's do a check of the markets here, sponsored by tasty trade looking at green across the screen but just barely.The dow is underneath that 40,000 level that it hit its all time high at yesterday.The S and P 500 just flipping above 5300 here.Just barely though.So we'll monitor what or not that is able to hold on here.The NASDAQ also just barely up here.We see not a ton of conviction, not a lot of volume and also just not a lot of momentum heading into the trade as we kick off the day about an hour or two hours into the trade here.All right, let's talk Boeing because Boeing's annual shareholder meeting is set to kick off 11 a.m. Eastern time today.One of the big questions being voted on is whether it embattled Ceo Dave Calhoun, who will step down by the end of the year, whether or not he's going to be re elected to the company's board for more on this.And what ultimately lee shareholders want to see happen at Boeing or prioritize here for Boeing.We wanna bring in Tony Bancroft, the belly funds, portfolio manager and Boeing shareholder.I it's great to see you Tony.So talk to me just about what you think Boeing should prioritize and what you're hoping to learn at today's shareholder meeting.Hey Shanna.Uh great to be here.Thank you.Uh You know, I think for priority uh my focus as a shareholder in our uh Gabelli commercial airspace and F uh GC ad ETF I think would be number one.I, I mean, I know they've got to get through the, the um uh the technicalities of just going through the uh the annual meeting and uh voting on um on voting on directors and, and uh, and uh CEO pay.But to me, the focus is they've got to get a, uh, they've got to announce and in place in a new CEO now that they've announced that the O Calhoun is leaving, uh, you know, they've, they've got to get the Spirit deal uh done with and uh put in the books.Uh thirdly, they've got to get the 737 max um uh authorization increased production with the fa uh increase to above 38.And then lastly, they, they've got to get the 787 deliveries production and, you know, uh, and supply chain uh squared away and, and that's what I'd be looking for in the sort of the, the near term.So I'm curious, Tony, uh you obviously know that shareholders are voting today on whether outgoing Ceo Dave Calhoun should remain on the board.What would your take on that be?You know, iii I refer that to our proxy voting committee.Uh But me personally, I, you know, I, I have no, no problem uh with Ceo Calhoun, uh Matty, I think he's, you know, actually I've done a great job, you know, just remember he took over in the midst of, of uh two mishaps.Um And then obviously on top of that, uh COVID hit the worst downturn in uh commercial air travel in history and, and he essentially brought Boeing back from about zero production of the 737 max of 38 a month.That's a, you know, that's a large increase and he did a, he did a pretty good job.Um So overall, I I have no issues with the CEO Calhoun.Who do you think Boeing should consider or, or when you talk about what that past experience should be?Who do you think some of those not, not naming specific names but talking about the possible success or just what that conversation looks like?Yeah, Sean, I think it's, it's probably gotta be, someone doesn't need to be an insider.It could be, but it somebody needs to have a, a technical background.Um you know, you know, Boeing at some point is going to have to design a new plane.There will come a time when, you know, technology and efficiency uh is going to uh out, outrun the current uh the current um production aircraft.And I think someone who has an understanding and background to work with engineers uh is probably, is probably a pretty uh, it can be heavily weighted, uh, for the decision, at least, at least in my opinion.And II, I think most probably, uh, investors are probably thinking the same way.Well, Tony, let's just talk about the obvious here.Boeing's had a really rough couple of months here.I mean, my friends, whenever they see a plane issue in the news, they just assume that it's Boeing.How bad is that for the stock?And would that issue for them, the safety issues ever change your mind on Boeing?Yeah.You know, you know, it's a good point, Maddie, I think the reality is that Boeing has, has, has partially lost the narrative of, of, of sort of the reality of what's going on.You know, right now there's multiple 737 max aircraft launching and safely recovering all, all around the world.And, you know, uh just statistically speaking, the fa uh fleet is the safest fleet in the world and probably the safest, uh you know, form of public transportation in history.We haven't had a crash related fatality since 2009 of 15 years.That's about 10 to 12 billion passengers traveling safe safely in under FAA watch.And 51% of that fleet of the FAA fleet are Boeing aircraft.So they're by far the mass majority of, of us driving the safety in this country.But, you know, with that being said, you know, sometimes perceptions reality and I think the reality is Boeing is just gonna have to just keep blocking and tackling, moving forward and, um, you know, producing safe aircraft, which they have done for, you know, last uh multiple, multiple decades and they'll continue to do, uh going forward to www when we talk about the future of Boeing, what exactly that's going to look like the potential acquisition interest here that we have seen in spirit aerosystems.I'm curious from a shareholder perspectives.Does that increase the value here for shareholders?Why or why not?And then there have been some issues raised just about the, the impact that this is ultimately going to have on the industrial industry and the defense industry at large.How should investors be looking at that?I, I think in the near term, it's gonna cause volatility.Obviously, it's gonna be a big cost, you know, Boeing is gonna, is gonna have to pay uh pay for, for Spirit.Uh Obviously, they have to get figured out with the Airbus of how they're going to uh deal with the two production plans um that, that produce uh you know, Airbus, Airbus um components.Um And then after that, you know, I'm on a run rate is probably gonna save Boeing about a billion dollars a year in uh in cost by, by owning these businesses.And I, I think more importantly, you know, it's, it's gonna own the culture and it's sort of gonna be one team, one fight uh you know, fuselage, the critical uh go stores component for an aircraft.You, you're not gonna get two fusil suppliers.And I think it's just, you know, it's just, it's, I think it's pretty apparent that uh the OEM who's producing the aircraft needs to own, needs to own that, that component of the aircraft, it's just so critical as far as production supply chain, you know, you name it.So I think in the long run, this is gonna be very beneficial to Boeing and uh it's, it's just the right thing to do.All right, Tony, we're gonna have to leave it there, but really appreciate you joining us today ahead of this shareholder meeting.Thank you so much.That was Tony Bancroft Gabelli funds portfolio manager and Boeing shareholder.Now, Tesla is reportedly moving ahead with its plans to build a data center in China.It could be used to help develop the self driving algorithm that is according to reporting from Reuters.For more, we're going to bring in our very own pros Subramanian pro.This is a really big deal.What do we know so far?Well, it's actually a bit bit wrinkle here.It's not much of they're building a data center is that they're actually using the data there and they can't bring it to the US, they had to or, or, or already have a data center in China for their, you know, the uh local regulations about data collection So the the key was is that Musk wanted to bring all that data from the, from China to the US to train the self driving A I.All right, can't do that.So now according to Reuters is reversing course and said, OK, we'll we'll build well, data center stays here, the data stays here, we'll train the algorithm in China.I mean, it's, it's important because that's where the most cars in the world with, with, with the FSD type sensors are in China.Um You have also have a lot of mapping technology or a lot of other partners there that are, that are gonna share data.So he's saying potentially, what if we train the Algo there in China and then take that information and spread elsewhere, right?That's sort of like the kind of the the pivot here.Uh there's some risk there, you know, with dealing with China, you never know when they can lock you down, you never know when they can say, you know what we're gonna stop you here.So it's it's kind of a risk.But also I think he sees that as an opportunity, you know, they use the the Reuters article notes that China Giga factory became the leading factory there for them.And that wasn't necessarily going to be the case when people thought about them creating that factory there.So maybe China is the push, maybe China is the sort of the angle for where they're gonna attack FSD?Is this a strategy that you think?Do analysts think that it makes sense in terms of Tesla's longer term goals in trying to increase that widespread adoption?II I, yeah, I think there's two parts, right?I think, yes, because it's a big market, there's, it's sort of widely mapped other players like Baidu already doing that stuff there and you can kind of work together with.But the problem is that then they don't necessarily own the data potentially, right?Also, there's a mention of how you can't sell these NVIDIA chips in China because they're they're banned.So how do you get around that?They need those chips to, to build a data center and to train the Algo.So um but yeah, I think they're right, there is an opportunity but also some risk.Yeah, certainly it seems like, yeah, there, it seems like there's a number of risks and almost like it has to be weighed just in terms of whether or not those risks uh outweigh some of the benefits that maybe Tesla could see or to this.But clearly this story, we're gonna keep following the right price.Great stuff.Thanks.Let's take a look at applied materials.Aim at the country's largest semiconductor equipment maker.Shares are essentially flat this morning, but we're bringing this up because we're getting data out the latest earnings report here and pointing to some larger trends that we wanna highlight and what this exactly tells us about the chip industry.So when it comes to what these expectations were investors were looking at am at for signs of whether or not this chip recovery is well underway.Remember that this is a stock, if you actually take a look at a longer term chart of applied materials, this is a stock that has actually risen about 30% this year.So these results failing to really live up to those expectations or give investors a reason to buy at these elevated levels.But it does give us a good sense of demand and some crucial parts of of the electronic supply chain here.So again, they forecast a bit tepid here at least that's the view of some of them, some investors and analysts at this point.Matt.Yeah, it's interesting seeing some of the commentary that we're already getting in after this update from a A as well.Morgan Stanley's analyst Joseph Moore saying he reiterated his equal weight rating saying that the forecast is conservative around China spending next year.Again, China spending continuing to come up across a lot of these prints.He said that they're impressed by their execution, but they don't see an immediate an imminent negative catalyst with the China spending but still something to watch because it was a little bit conservative there.Again, those sales in the third quarter could remain flat, essentially given what we already know from them and it just continues to be another name that is impacted by China spending on chips in particular.But interesting to see whether or not that is going to be able to normalize a little bit, particularly as the situation in China potentially normalizes after that government intervention there and looking at cannabis stocks as well there in the green this morning, after you, after the US Department of Justice officially unveiled their proposal to ease restrictions on marijuana.Under the proposal, cannabis would be reclassified from a schedule one drug to schedule three.Now, just to remind people, schedule one, some of those drugs, cocaine, uh fentaNYL, I mean, really intense drugs here schedule three, a much more moderate uh schedule sign that the drugs in that category have a low potential for physical or psychological dependence.Some of the other drugs in that area include the likes of Advil so much.Uh It's a really big deal.It's a huge shift.Now we did see some of these cannabis stocks moving to the upside, but they are still well below their five year high as a company like here leaf is still down 66% from its highs to re we've spoken with the CEO together Shana down nearly 97% from its highs as well.And there is some talk about whether or not this is a deal or, or a move that is being done before the election because it could potentially win uh the favor here of especially the younger voters here for President Biden.We know President Biden yesterday, uh endorsing this.We did see some of that excitement play out when you come to the cannabis stocks and the movement that we saw to the upside here yesterday saying that they are going to treat this.He's going to treat this as marijuana as a less dangerous drug.Now, we do, it's important to point out that this isn't going to legalize weed though under the federal law, right, only Congress can do that.But again, it is giving investors a reason to buy.We did initially, I see the excitement when this report was initially released.We've talked to a number of the, these cannabis CEO S talking about the fact that this is largely viewed as a massive step in the right direction.Clearly, more reform needs to be seen in order to have a massive catalyst here for these stocks.But it is enough for many of these names to catch a bid here in early trading, catch a bid yesterday.And that's what we're seeing play out when you take a look at the stock action today.Well, we're gonna have more of your market's action ahead.So stay tuned for all of that and more.You're looking at gains across your screen, the S and P just above for 5300, but the dow is still below that 48,000 level.Keep it here for more.You're watching Catalysts Netflix's surprise three year partnership with the NFL is marking a major shift into live sports programming, live programming in general here for the streaming giant for how the street is interpreting this deal.What ultimately this means for Netflix Yahoo Finance's very own.Alexandra Canal is here and Ali I know you've been speaking with a number of analysts, just give us a better sense of how they're viewing this deal and whether or not how big of an opportunity this is for Netflix by and large reaction on the street is very positive, especially considering sports has been considered the last frontier of the streaming wars.However, there are some on Wall Street that say that this might be more of an experiment for Netflix really testing the waters to potentially bid on more live sports down the line.Jason Bas from city told Yahoo finance, he doesn't necessarily think the NFL will help Netflix retain loyal subscribers over the long term, but that it's still a good thing and a natural evolution of the industry.JP Morgan.Meanwhile, that the games will offer a boost to Netflix says add here and that seems to be the driving story here that it's going to be a great opportunity for advertising and will also deep in Netflix relationship with the NFL analyst do.And it also said that the deal terms are attractive.Now, Netflix is not revealed any specific figures, but Bloomberg has reported that they are paying less than $150 million per game.And that's actually less than what they, they spent for some of their original movies.Like the great, for example, and considering the NFL has such a large built in audience that is attractive at the end of the day.And really what it comes down to is that live sports, live events in general, we've seen them really double down with live comedy events.There's a stickiness there, there's this on demand appointment viewing and if you have that element, you're going to attract subscribers and hopefully once they're there, you can keep them there longer based on the content that you already have on the platform.And that's what we're really seeing across the board.Netflix is pretty much shied away a little bit from the live sports game, but now we're seeing them really dive right in with this NFL partnership.Well, I know in your reporting, you highlight the number of games that Netflix has compared to the other ones and it's like a really tiny percentage, obviously.Um I wonder is there a world in which people end up being like, I don't even know where to find my NFL games and then that ends up being a headwind or do they have the marketing budgets that that's not really going to be an issue?Listen from the consumer perspect if this isn't ideal.And I do think over time, that's why we're seeing all these bundled offerings, right?I think we're going to eventually see more consolidation in this space.But the NFL has several partners are seeing those on your screen right now and Netflix only has two games.But there are one piece of a very large pie between broadcasters and streaming giants.Now, the NFL, the NBA, all these major leagues, they want to get as much money as possible and they're realizing that if they can siphon off certain games, they can get a lot large amount of money for those specific games and have them as exclusive offers on these different streaming services.So as a consumer, you're going to have to pay a heck of a lot more money than you're used to paying uh in order to watch every single one of these games and that doesn't create the best user experience.I'm curious from your reporting and from you who you've been speaking with the experts within this area, how sticky are the customers who maybe do try out some of these services just for the games?Have we seen data on it or is it still a bit too early to really figure out what that traction level looks like?Peacock did host an exclusive NFL game last season and they did see a bump in their Peacock subscribers and most of them did stay for the duration.So I think we're still a little too early to know if that can be replicated across the board there.But again, it all comes down to the type of content that you have on your platform that can keep people there.Obviously, there's a new season of Bridgerton now I am fan.So, you know, as someone that is a fan of those types of shows, sure if you can get them on the platform for a live event and then they can stay for some of your other scripted content.That's great.But there's also a lot of competition right now on the market and that's really where all this is coming to a head.So we'll see if this is just cyclical.We'll see if this is the norm that these live events are just going to be receiving a lot of money and we know sports in general, the value of those have ballooned.But for now, Netflix is getting into the game.I forgot that Bridger was back.Oh, yeah, I watched the first episode last night.That's, I mean, that's the weekend, but they're doing it in two parts though.So you can't fully binge it, which is, yeah, which is a strategy that they've been doing.There you go.All right, we can talk to you forever.But the police are yelling at me.Thank you so much.Really appreciate you as always.Well, NVIDIA shares are surging so far this year up over 90% year to date and investors eagerly awaiting those first quarter results coming up next week.Here's a look back at the company's rise.Stocks are poised to end the week higher.All three major averages hovering near their record highs.The S and P 500 just above the 5300 level, the Dow just under that 40,000 level.But the star of the show this week is the Dow briefly passing that critical 40,000 mark on Thursday.So we want to zero in on the big names that drove that rally stocks that doubled the Dow since 2017.Among the winners, Apple at the top United Health Health, Microsoft Caterpillar and Goldman Sachs.These are really the names to watch because of the degree to which they drove this rally.But having said that Shaw of the Dow is like such a funny little index because it's more of an average of prices rather than it doesn't weigh things correctly.One could argue and the company waiting in the index are so different than their market cap.So when you look at a name like Apple has having a lower waiting than Home Depot, that's just, yeah, certainly it's, it's an interesting to point out it's important to point out.And I think that's why so many investors really were talking a lot about the S and P and the movements that we're seeing there versus focus specifically on the Dow and the Dow components, which obviously a shift going back many, many, many years.But I think that when we talk about 40,000, the level of 40,000 that milestone, what it means.Psychologically, I think there is reason to be excited about it.Clearly, my take away from the conversations we have been having with so many strategists here at Yahoo Finance over the last week is hey, when we are at the out the the levels that we are currently at and valuations are as high as they are.Yes, we are due for a pullback, right?It's not exactly going to be just up and away from here at these levels with the dow at 40,000, with the S and P right around 5300.But there is still reason to be optimistic just about what that action could look like between now and to end.So maybe we should be ready for a pullback.We could get a pull back around 5% but then we also could reverse and trend higher.That's actually viewed as being healthy here for the market.So my takeaway is that yes, there's a lot to be excited about when you talk about 40,000.There's also reason to be a little bit hesitant or questioning the current levels, the current value viewing a potential blowback as healthy here for the broader markets.And then ultimately, like Brian Bowski, where we started the show saying there's reason to think and reason to believe that we could see the S and P hitting 5600 by the end of the year, 5600 hats.Get them ready.All right.Well, coming up is wealth dedicated to all of your personal finance needs.Our very own Brad Smith is gonna have you for that during the next hour.So stay tuned.",

that is markets just at record highs here today you ve got the s and p 500 just around that 5300 mark the dow hitting 40 000 yesterday our next guest see more room to the upside he s got a year end target for the s and p 500 a 5600  the highest call on the street so let s bring him in we ve got brian bbmo  capital markets  a chief investment strategist  brian it s good to see you so you and i were talking not that long you sounded a bullish for your previous target now you re raising why now and what s the catalyst  shana good morning  good morning  yahoo um you know  a lot of people were telling or accusing us of being bearish because we said  uh in late february that the market was getting a little tippy  toppy and needed to be sideways here  especially considering the type of move that we saw story continuesyou know  we really believe first off that us stocks are in a 25 year secular bull market uh number two  we believe that the cyclical portion of the bull market means this new cyclical bull started in october of 2022 typically and historically  the second year of a bull market has a  has an average correction of 9 6  um and we didn t see that we only had like a 5  correction and so given what we re seeing in earnings  given what we re seeing and hearing from what the fed is gonna do and we think equities now are becoming an increasingly important part of people s asset mixes  especially considering what s going on in the bond market in the unwind of what we d like to call the 40 year bull market in bonds uh  we think that there s more upside and so it doesn t mean that stocks are gonna be linear forever uh  we are going to see some sort of a normal correction uh  and i think that s a better buying opportunity  but for now  uh  i think the screens are green and the skies are blue and we re going to have a little bit more upside here brian  what do you think that correction  that short term correction could look like well  i think it comes from a higher level so  you know  a lot of the technicians out there use this phrase higher lows i think this period  this year is gonna be a period of higher lows so i think the correction comes from a little bit higher prices and so it would be from a  from a technical perspective and from a just a pure health perspective of the market  it would be nice to um take a  take a bit of a breather here uh in the in the bull market and the upside price appreciation  take a respite  get ready for the summer into the fall and i think uh fourth quarter in particular  especially post election will do very well but brian  what would the catalyst for that pullback be i mean  this market is acting like that cp i print was the best thing it s ever seen and it really wasn t that soft no  it wasn t that actually is a really great  uh  point i think that we as investors  um  have and when we ve reared an entire generation of investors that only believe that stocks go up of interest rates go down and if you think about it  we enter 2020 for meaning the stock market and the investing world thinking and believing that the fed is going to cut six times while all of a sudden that changed and as early as 10 or 14 days ago  people were talking about the fed raising rates and so i do think that we re transitioning quite frankly into more of a trading range environment  more of a focus on the stocks versus uh the forest through the trees uh let s call it versus all this macro so what could be the catalyst i think for a pullback would be some sort of a near term uh scare and interest rate  some sort of a near term uh momentum change whether or not it s geopolitical or not i don t think it s fundamental i don t think it s fundamental is because the earnings prowess  the united states stock market is very strong  the cash flow strength is strong return on equity is strong and we do think actually there s a portion of the market quite frankly where numbers are too low  especially namely in some concern stocks  but financial financial financials i think an area where analysts have been too conservative in their outlook and i think a lot of earnings power will come from the financial sector well  brian  let s talk about earnings i always love to monitor mentions of things and earnings that s always fun uh  pricing power mentions are down expense management mentions outpacing pricing power mentions by quite a bit here can companies in the s and p expense manage their way to 5600 expense managing their their way through the last 15 years for all intents and purposes  it s called under  under promise and over deliver uh we on wall street as investors or portfolio managers  which we are as well we love it  love it  love it  love it  love it when  when companies cut costs and shut down divisions and restructure because it shows that they re having discipline that s why if you take a look at free cash flow and you look at the operating performance  whether or not it s return on asset return on invested capital return on equity has been so strong um you know  we think too from the discern ability of earnings and the consistency of earnings is stronger that we ve seen in prior big bull market cycles and so to me  this reminds me a lot more of the mid nineties prior to the irrational exuberance of 1996 which oh by the way  was had nothing to do with tech stocks  had everything to do with the consumer staples area what you re talking about pricing power  like you remember  the consumer staples um sector benefited from food inflation and their  and their earnings have been strong now you re starting to see those stocks roll over that s why like a stock like walmart  it s just a juggernaut they ve done an amazing job with their inventory in their stores and in the  in the  especially in the grocery side uh but that  that stock in particular  i think is kind of bucking the trend and the in a consumer staples sector by the way  which we think is increasingly expensive and one we think you should ignore  aside from  let s say walmart and costco brian  going back to where you are seeing those opportunities within the market  you mentioned financials  you ve been overweight that sector now for some time  you re expecting that out performance here when it comes to future earnings where else are you seeing that opportunity and have that at all changed from when you initially came out with your s and p target for the year no  it hasn t changed i mean  we re right now positioned as a barbell  right o overweight  um technology and financials and i think the difference with technology the second half of the year is dare i say they re not quite second tier companies  they re not  they re not microsoft and apple  which are really the part uh in nvidia  part of the  the magnificent seven which oh by the way  number seven in the magnificent seven is hathaway so uh so the  the financial stock is kind of snuck into that  be that as it may  i think stocks like qualcomm and a md and broadcom and oracle and salesforce and adobe um some of the second tier companies relative to the top ones like microsoft and apple  i think they re gonna take more buying power and more kind of increased money i think too  that we ve seen an overall broadening out of  of the market you ve seen the equal weight that s and p uh hit new highs you ve seen look at small and mid cap are doing very well as well and i think that s the opportunity there so i think an overall broadening out and they don t also forget um healthcare  healthcare is the second largest sector in the market and um i think healthcare aside  so such as uh focus has been on lily and the like which we are very fortunate to own the stock but you know  the united healthcare and the mercks and the engines of the world  i think are stocks that could do very  very well the second half of the year all right  brian  we re going to have to leave it there thank you so much for joining us we really appreciate it that was brian bell he is bmo capital markets chief investment strategist now  investors are looking ahead to in video results next week which could drive more momentum in the current market rally shares of video significantly outperformed the rest of the market for the last year they are up a whopping 96  year to date the big question though  can the chip making powerhouse deliver on lofty expectations joining us now on  this is our very own miles  miles thank you as always for being here i mean  can they  can they pull it off who knows to find out i think that  you know  in the context of what brian was just talking about with respect to the overall market rally right now  the shape of that rally  the drivers of that rally in videos report that everyone s been eyeing for quite a long time and obviously the the structure around it  how investors expect this to factor into the overall situation that doesn t change too much it s still a high volatility event  both for the company and i think overall  but the context in which they are reporting has changed quite a bit over the last month in that there s now much more enthusiasm from investors around what the earnings picture is going to look like  not just in this quarter but over the balance of the year you know  as brian was discussing the fundamental idea  like the idea that a fundamental reason to see a  you know  910 15  pull back this year has really faded in investors minds so i will be curious to see if nvidia becomes a much more specific a i trade and like  how could it be more specifically a i but i mean  it  in the sense of all those pullbacks we saw at the beginning of earning season  the ts ms of the world  um  does that come back for nvidia but does the market kind of move on anyway  i  i guess  put it even more plainly for the viewers just how significant this one report really is for the market when you re talking about these growth rates that we ve seen at nvidia also  just how unusual it is we pointed this out in our morning brief here uh this morning at yahoo finance lee  he wrote it but when you talk about how unusual it is for this type of growth to continue when you got a company at this size yeah  it gets back to a conversation that sort of picked up at the end of last year  which was  are we sure that the semiconductor industry is no longer a cyclical business because it has long been a heavily cyclical business and that  meaning there are times at which you see order growth 100  plus  i mean  nvidia has seen revenue grow  um and and earnings grow much more aggressively than that over the last several quarters um and then there s a time when you start to see a pull back  we ve had a lot of cap x from the biggest tech companies already outlined  those are going to be many of nvidia s customers so analysts can do the math on what that implies in terms of the growth rate for the company but we re really talking about what s 2026 look like for nvidia  what does 2028 look like for nvidia and how much has that story changed and you know  to julie s point  you don t typically see again in whether it s a company of this size in video obviously  you know  many trillions of market cap  you know  two trillion market cap at this point um not only companies of that size but industries in which there is such a cyclical component to it um growth rates like that continue indefinitely all right well  it s clearly a story we will be covering very closely here you by miles amazing thanks so much another fact that we re watching today is game that we ve got shares of the meme stock here falling this morning at losses of 23  of prelim results here showing a drop in first quarter sales they also issuing here a plan to sell shares and that s really what is moved the stock here in early trading we want to talk about all of this and what is next for gamestop and the trade a large for that we want to bring back he s what bush equity research and managing director michael it s great to see you before we get into it just first your quick reaction to the news that we re getting out on game stop this morning well  i think they re pretty smart um  you  you definitely have to give them credit for capitalizing on the opportunity to build their war chest um  i m not seeing anything in the preannouncement that tells me that the business is turning around uh  but at least they ll raise enough cash to last another three or four years if they  uh  if they in fact continue to flail and try to find a new strategy so i admire that they re taking advantage of the opportunity that s  that s probably in the best interest of their longer term shareholders i feel sorry for the fools who buy the stock at 21 because it s worth single digits and i ll have a note out shortly my  my targets under review ok but still michael  i mean  we saw roaring kitty getting back on x and then that causing a little bit of this rally i know it wasn t the only cause  but could there be another random catalyst that leads to a gamestop rally that really isn t about the company fundamentals well  with  with respect to her and kitty because he was absolutely right in 2020 um there was a structural flaw in the holdings of gamestop i mean  they had more than 100  of the share short and he made that obs observation  it was astute  he rallied uh retail investors  redditors  you know  reddit raiders to  to buy into the stock and he was right and they made  they made a movie about it and he was right um  now he s not actually doing anything other than posting video clips and  you know  i  i  he  he was dormant for two or three years he just started a frenzy of post  but they re all video clips only one had any reference to gamestop it was a woman with a gamestop logo on her dress um i don t know what he s saying so sure  you know  guys posting movie clips saying it s over what s that mean um if you want to buy a stock based on that  god bless you  but he has not actually said go buy gamestop so mike  what do you think the next several months  several quarters look like here then for gamestop  they re going to see continued declines uh there s nothing big coming out this year you know  we don t have anything incremental this year  next year  you have grand theft auto but nothing big no new consoles this year uh the console makers are all kind of guiding to lower expectations sony is looking to sell 18 million consoles they were looking to sell 25 million before um the  the big news today  which is a wall street journal exclusive speculation that called it duty will be on game pass um i can confidently tell you that anybody who s a game pass  subscriber would be an idiot to buy call of duty  they won t so call of duty sales will be lower this year it wasn t on game pass last year and that means physical sales at gamestop will be lower because of that so lots of  uh  of head winds for them and i don t see any way out of it the preliminary results were actually worse than we had modeled they did under 900 million of revenue and we had modeled a billion that s down 25  year over year now  that s not all industry decline some of that is store closures and we don t have the detail yet  but realistically  they cannot save their way to prosperity their store unit economics can t get any better you have to have an employee in the store you can t leave it at self serve or people will steal everything and you can t not pay rent or not turn the lights on so they re  they re done shrinking their cost structure the only question is  can they  you know  shrink their store count and re return to profitability i don t think so they lost money last year you know  they made 17 million net income with 45 million of interest income so they lost on an operating basis by over 30 million michael you mentioned the news that microsoft is reportedly planning to release the next installment of call of duty as a subscription service instead of the usual all car model that s according to the wall street journal here do you think that that is a game changing move for microsoft it is  i mean  they  they  you know  game pass as a subscription service is only worth  15 a month  you know  100 and  80 a year if you play more than 100 and  80 worth of games so  so roughly three games a year  if you can use game pass instead of purchasing three games  it s a good deal that s why we pay  you know  for netflix  we pay about the same for netflix  but we want enough content to make it feel worth its while  you know  worthwhile um and so microsoft s just trying to build the content so that they have enough people view the subscription as an attractive substitute for purchasing games um yes  good for microsoft in the long run they won t be making money on game pass until they get to around 100 million subscribers and they re at 34 million so the only way they re going to get to 100 million is to put premium content on there like call of duty um uh they own call of duty so it s gonna cost them the sales of call of duty  which is also gonna cost gamestop and they re just hoping that they get enough subscribers to  to make up the difference they won t this year  but they might in five years and i certainly think they will intend so they re willing to take some losses while they build the business out i quickly want to talk to you about one other name that you cover  which is beyond  you ve got an outperform on it this includes bed bath and beyond for anyone who may not know they obviously had their own issues and recovered to a degree is there any evidence that gamestop could follow a similar path as bed bath and beyond uh well  they could follow a similar path as the former  as the bankrupt debt bath and beyond uh follow a similar path as marcus lemonis led beyond no  i don t think so uh i i had to look the word stand up to it s  it s a stalker fan that s me and marcus i i am absolute stan i love that guy um now you  it takes a visionary retail leader like marcus to turn a company like beyond around um he s buying that brands he bought the bed bath and beyond brand are actually for men he bought the zulu brand and he s revitalizing the overstock brand um i love that i think they re gonna be kind of all by themselves and close up merchandise they re gonna be a premium brand for home furnishings and a premium brand for toddler uh merchandise i think that that gamestop if they try to re invent themselves more power to them but what s left i mean  we ve already seen ryan cohen do chewy is he gonna try to sell dog food through the games stock brand i doubt it you know  i  i mean  for real and the gamestop brand s problem is that the substitute is not  you know  a  a different online retailer or a different physical retailer the substitute is a digital download gamestop sells something you don t need to purchase physically beyond does not beyond sells stuff that you re either gonna buy at a different online retailer or you re going to go to a physical store to get  you can t digitally download a couch  just can t happen so you can digitally download call of duty and microsoft s making making it easier by letting you stream it so very easy to to not make that purchase at gamestop no  they cannot follow in this in the path of beyond unless somehow ryan cohen takes his  you know  billion dollar cash balance and pays it to marcus limona since he s marcus turn business r for all right  michael  we re going to have to leave it there thank you so much for joining us we really appreciate it that was michael pachter he is wedbush equity research managing director china is unveiling plans to revitalize its property sector  the country easing mortgage rules and pushing local governments to buy unsold homes to develop more affordable housing now this sending china s property index shares higher in the pre market here you can see that in the trade here actually  i should say  but shana taking a step back just to go over kind of what this is the rescue package is meant to prop up the property market in china  which has really just been in shambles over the past couple of years here this is the most urgent step that we ve seen from authorities they re going to have about  40 billion that will go to state owned entities to convert empty homes to social housing and just to indicate kind of the context of how tough the situation has been for housing we have data overnight from china showing that housing prices fell at their steepest levels in over a decade here and this makes up about a quarter of china s overall economy so a really big deal to see that struggle in the housing sector last thing i want to bring up is a note that we got from ubs  paul don in this morning and he was basically talking about this idea that if the growth target for china is met through production output  for example  rather than domestic consumption  china could be vulnerable to trade reprisals and things like tariffs moving forward if your economy is based on sending stuff out and then you get a lot of tariffs that could be a big headwind for china  which then is a headwind to a lot of the companies that we talk about all the time yeah  i think  i think the what ultimately the impact that this is going to have remains to be seen right there s a lot out there  a lot of stress  just a lot of forecasters saying that clearly they re not out the woods just yet i think that is largely the consensus at this point given the struggles that you had just been highlighting here but the move writing 40  42 billion of funding to buy those unsold homes it does mark a transition or a difference in the stance that we have seen beijing take on the property sector here in china so it certainly is significant what exactly this does ultimately to prop up the economy down the road we are starting to see that recovery gain a bit of traction in china but again  the data continues to be mixed we did see some pressure on the latest consumer data coming out and then you take a look at the industrial numbers actually and they showed they pointed to a sign of strength there and we re seeing that play out in some of the commodity trading  especially oil  that movement to the upside here that we are seeing today so again  remains to be seen  certainly a story to watch here and more broadly speaking  the impact that this could potentially have on china s economy and that recovery and what exactly that means ultimately here for the global markets all right well  coming up boeing s annual meeting is in less than an hour  we will speak to a shareholder of boeing to get his take on what to expect and what he wants to hear from boeing we ll be right back let s do a check of the markets here  sponsored by tasty trade looking at green across the screen but just barely the dow is underneath that 40 000 level that it hit its all time high at yesterday the s and p 500 just flipping above 5300 here just barely though so we ll monitor what or not that is able to hold on here the nasdaq also just barely up here we see not a ton of conviction  not a lot of volume and also just not a lot of momentum heading into the trade as we kick off the day about an hour or two hours into the trade here all right  let s talk boeing because boeing s annual shareholder meeting is set to kick off 11 a m  eastern time today one of the big questions being voted on is whether it embattled ceo dave calhoun  who will step down by the end of the year  whether or not he s going to be re elected to the company s board for more on this and what ultimately lee shareholders want to see happen at boeing or prioritize here for boeing we wanna bring in tony bancroft  the belly funds  portfolio manager and boeing shareholder i it s great to see you tony so talk to me just about what you think boeing should prioritize and what you re hoping to learn at today s shareholder meeting hey shanna uh great to be here thank you uh you know  i think for priority uh my focus as a shareholder in our uh gabelli commercial airspace and f uh gc ad etf i think would be number one i  i mean  i know they ve got to get through the  the um uh the technicalities of just going through the uh the annual meeting and uh voting on um on voting on directors and  and uh  and uh ceo pay but to me  the focus is they ve got to get a  uh  they ve got to announce and in place in a new ceo now that they ve announced that the o calhoun is leaving  uh  you know  they ve  they ve got to get the spirit deal uh done with and uh put in the books uh thirdly  they ve got to get the 737 max um uh authorization increased production with the fa uh increase to above 38 and then lastly  they  they ve got to get the 787 deliveries production and  you know  uh  and supply chain uh squared away and  and that s what i d be looking for in the sort of the  the near term so i m curious  tony  uh you obviously know that shareholders are voting today on whether outgoing ceo dave calhoun should remain on the board what would your take on that be you know  iii i refer that to our proxy voting committee uh but me personally  i  you know  i  i have no  no problem uh with ceo calhoun  uh matty  i think he s  you know  actually i ve done a great job  you know  just remember he took over in the midst of  of uh two mishaps um and then obviously on top of that  uh covid hit the worst downturn in uh commercial air travel in history and  and he essentially brought boeing back from about zero production of the 737 max of 38 a month that s a  you know  that s a large increase and he did a  he did a pretty good job um so overall  i i have no issues with the ceo calhoun who do you think boeing should consider or  or when you talk about what that past experience should be who do you think some of those not  not naming specific names but talking about the possible success or just what that conversation looks like yeah  sean  i think it s  it s probably gotta be  someone doesn t need to be an insider it could be  but it somebody needs to have a  a technical background um you know  you know  boeing at some point is going to have to design a new plane there will come a time when  you know  technology and efficiency uh is going to uh out  outrun the current uh the current um production aircraft and i think someone who has an understanding and background to work with engineers uh is probably  is probably a pretty uh  it can be heavily weighted  uh  for the decision  at least  at least in my opinion and ii  i think most probably  uh  investors are probably thinking the same way well  tony  let s just talk about the obvious here boeing s had a really rough couple of months here i mean  my friends  whenever they see a plane issue in the news  they just assume that it s boeing how bad is that for the stock and would that issue for them  the safety issues ever change your mind on boeing yeah you know  you know  it s a good point  maddie  i think the reality is that boeing has  has  has partially lost the narrative of  of  of sort of the reality of what s going on you know  right now there s multiple 737 max aircraft launching and safely recovering all  all around the world and  you know  uh just statistically speaking  the fa uh fleet is the safest fleet in the world and probably the safest  uh you know  form of public transportation in history we haven t had a crash related fatality since 2009 of 15 years that s about 10 to 12 billion passengers traveling safe safely in under faa watch and 51  of that fleet of the faa fleet are boeing aircraft so they re by far the mass majority of  of us driving the safety in this country but  you know  with that being said  you know  sometimes perceptions reality and i think the reality is boeing is just gonna have to just keep blocking and tackling  moving forward and  um  you know  producing safe aircraft  which they have done for  you know  last uh multiple  multiple decades and they ll continue to do  uh going forward to www when we talk about the future of boeing  what exactly that s going to look like the potential acquisition interest here that we have seen in spirit aerosystems i m curious from a shareholder perspectives does that increase the value here for shareholders why or why not and then there have been some issues raised just about the  the impact that this is ultimately going to have on the industrial industry and the defense industry at large how should investors be looking at that i  i think in the near term  it s gonna cause volatility obviously  it s gonna be a big cost  you know  boeing is gonna  is gonna have to pay uh pay for  for spirit uh obviously  they have to get figured out with the airbus of how they re going to uh deal with the two production plans um that  that produce uh you know  airbus  airbus um components um and then after that  you know  i m on a run rate is probably gonna save boeing about a billion dollars a year in uh in cost by  by owning these businesses and i  i think more importantly  you know  it s  it s gonna own the culture and it s sort of gonna be one team  one fight uh you know  fuselage  the critical uh go stores component for an aircraft you  you re not gonna get two fusil suppliers and i think it s just  you know  it s just  it s  i think it s pretty apparent that uh the oem who s producing the aircraft needs to own  needs to own that  that component of the aircraft  it s just so critical as far as production supply chain  you know  you name it so i think in the long run  this is gonna be very beneficial to boeing and uh it s  it s just the right thing to do all right  tony  we re gonna have to leave it there  but really appreciate you joining us today ahead of this shareholder meeting thank you so much that was tony bancroft gabelli funds portfolio manager and boeing shareholder now  tesla is reportedly moving ahead with its plans to build a data center in china it could be used to help develop the self driving algorithm that is according to reporting from reuters for more  we re going to bring in our very own pros subramanian pro this is a really big deal what do we know so far well  it s actually a bit bit wrinkle here it s not much of they re building a data center is that they re actually using the data there and they can t bring it to the us  they had to or  or  or already have a data center in china for their  you know  the uh local regulations about data collection so the the key was is that musk wanted to bring all that data from the  from china to the us to train the self driving a i all right  can t do that so now according to reuters is reversing course and said  ok  we ll we ll build well  data center stays here  the data stays here  we ll train the algorithm in china i mean  it s  it s important because that s where the most cars in the world with  with  with the fsd type sensors are in china um you have also have a lot of mapping technology or a lot of other partners there that are  that are gonna share data so he s saying potentially  what if we train the algo there in china and then take that information and spread elsewhere  right that s sort of like the kind of the the pivot here uh there s some risk there  you know  with dealing with china  you never know when they can lock you down  you never know when they can say  you know what we re gonna stop you here so it s it s kind of a risk but also i think he sees that as an opportunity  you know  they use the the reuters article notes that china giga factory became the leading factory there for them and that wasn t necessarily going to be the case when people thought about them creating that factory there so maybe china is the push  maybe china is the sort of the angle for where they re gonna attack fsd is this a strategy that you think do analysts think that it makes sense in terms of tesla s longer term goals in trying to increase that widespread adoption ii i  yeah  i think there s two parts  right i think  yes  because it s a big market  there s  it s sort of widely mapped other players like baidu already doing that stuff there and you can kind of work together with but the problem is that then they don t necessarily own the data potentially  right also  there s a mention of how you can t sell these nvidia chips in china because they re they re banned so how do you get around that they need those chips to  to build a data center and to train the algo so um but yeah  i think they re right  there is an opportunity but also some risk yeah  certainly it seems like  yeah  there  it seems like there s a number of risks and almost like it has to be weighed just in terms of whether or not those risks uh outweigh some of the benefits that maybe tesla could see or to this but clearly this story  we re gonna keep following the right price great stuff thanks let s take a look at applied materials aim at the country s largest semiconductor equipment maker shares are essentially flat this morning  but we re bringing this up because we re getting data out the latest earnings report here and pointing to some larger trends that we wanna highlight and what this exactly tells us about the chip industry so when it comes to what these expectations were investors were looking at am at for signs of whether or not this chip recovery is well underway remember that this is a stock  if you actually take a look at a longer term chart of applied materials  this is a stock that has actually risen about 30  this year so these results failing to really live up to those expectations or give investors a reason to buy at these elevated levels but it does give us a good sense of demand and some crucial parts of of the electronic supply chain here so again  they forecast a bit tepid here at least that s the view of some of them  some investors and analysts at this point matt yeah  it s interesting seeing some of the commentary that we re already getting in after this update from a a as well morgan stanley s analyst joseph moore saying he reiterated his equal weight rating saying that the forecast is conservative around china spending next year again  china spending continuing to come up across a lot of these prints he said that they re impressed by their execution  but they don t see an immediate an imminent negative catalyst with the china spending but still something to watch because it was a little bit conservative there again  those sales in the third quarter could remain flat  essentially given what we already know from them and it just continues to be another name that is impacted by china spending on chips in particular but interesting to see whether or not that is going to be able to normalize a little bit  particularly as the situation in china potentially normalizes after that government intervention there and looking at cannabis stocks as well there in the green this morning  after you  after the us department of justice officially unveiled their proposal to ease restrictions on marijuana under the proposal  cannabis would be reclassified from a schedule one drug to schedule three now  just to remind people  schedule one  some of those drugs  cocaine  uh fentanyl  i mean  really intense drugs here schedule three  a much more moderate uh schedule sign that the drugs in that category have a low potential for physical or psychological dependence some of the other drugs in that area include the likes of advil so much uh it s a really big deal it s a huge shift now we did see some of these cannabis stocks moving to the upside  but they are still well below their five year high as a company like here leaf is still down 66  from its highs to re we ve spoken with the ceo together shana down nearly 97  from its highs as well and there is some talk about whether or not this is a deal or  or a move that is being done before the election because it could potentially win uh the favor here of especially the younger voters here for president biden we know president biden yesterday  uh endorsing this we did see some of that excitement play out when you come to the cannabis stocks and the movement that we saw to the upside here yesterday saying that they are going to treat this he s going to treat this as marijuana as a less dangerous drug now  we do  it s important to point out that this isn t going to legalize weed though under the federal law  right  only congress can do that but again  it is giving investors a reason to buy we did initially  i see the excitement when this report was initially released we ve talked to a number of the  these cannabis ceo s talking about the fact that this is largely viewed as a massive step in the right direction clearly  more reform needs to be seen in order to have a massive catalyst here for these stocks but it is enough for many of these names to catch a bid here in early trading  catch a bid yesterday and that s what we re seeing play out when you take a look at the stock action today well  we re gonna have more of your market s action ahead so stay tuned for all of that and more you re looking at gains across your screen  the s and p just above for 5300  but the dow is still below that 48 000 level keep it here for more you re watching catalysts netflix s surprise three year partnership with the nfl is marking a major shift into live sports programming  live programming in general here for the streaming giant for how the street is interpreting this deal what ultimately this means for netflix yahoo finance s very own alexandra canal is here and ali i know you ve been speaking with a number of analysts  just give us a better sense of how they re viewing this deal and whether or not how big of an opportunity this is for netflix by and large reaction on the street is very positive  especially considering sports has been considered the last frontier of the streaming wars however  there are some on wall street that say that this might be more of an experiment for netflix really testing the waters to potentially bid on more live sports down the line jason bas from city told yahoo finance  he doesn t necessarily think the nfl will help netflix retain loyal subscribers over the long term  but that it s still a good thing and a natural evolution of the industry jp morgan meanwhile  that the games will offer a boost to netflix says add here and that seems to be the driving story here that it s going to be a great opportunity for advertising and will also deep in netflix relationship with the nfl analyst do and it also said that the deal terms are attractive now  netflix is not revealed any specific figures  but bloomberg has reported that they are paying less than  150 million per game and that s actually less than what they  they spent for some of their original movies like the great  for example  and considering the nfl has such a large built in audience that is attractive at the end of the day and really what it comes down to is that live sports  live events in general  we ve seen them really double down with live comedy events there s a stickiness there  there s this on demand appointment viewing and if you have that element  you re going to attract subscribers and hopefully once they re there  you can keep them there longer based on the content that you already have on the platform and that s what we re really seeing across the board netflix is pretty much shied away a little bit from the live sports game  but now we re seeing them really dive right in with this nfl partnership well  i know in your reporting  you highlight the number of games that netflix has compared to the other ones and it s like a really tiny percentage  obviously um i wonder is there a world in which people end up being like  i don t even know where to find my nfl games and then that ends up being a headwind or do they have the marketing budgets that that s not really going to be an issue listen from the consumer perspect if this isn t ideal and i do think over time  that s why we re seeing all these bundled offerings  right i think we re going to eventually see more consolidation in this space but the nfl has several partners are seeing those on your screen right now and netflix only has two games but there are one piece of a very large pie between broadcasters and streaming giants now  the nfl  the nba  all these major leagues  they want to get as much money as possible and they re realizing that if they can siphon off certain games  they can get a lot large amount of money for those specific games and have them as exclusive offers on these different streaming services so as a consumer  you re going to have to pay a heck of a lot more money than you re used to paying uh in order to watch every single one of these games and that doesn t create the best user experience i m curious from your reporting and from you who you ve been speaking with the experts within this area  how sticky are the customers who maybe do try out some of these services just for the games have we seen data on it or is it still a bit too early to really figure out what that traction level looks like peacock did host an exclusive nfl game last season and they did see a bump in their peacock subscribers and most of them did stay for the duration so i think we re still a little too early to know if that can be replicated across the board there but again  it all comes down to the type of content that you have on your platform that can keep people there obviously  there s a new season of bridgerton now i am fan so  you know  as someone that is a fan of those types of shows  sure if you can get them on the platform for a live event and then they can stay for some of your other scripted content that s great but there s also a lot of competition right now on the market and that s really where all this is coming to a head so we ll see if this is just cyclical we ll see if this is the norm that these live events are just going to be receiving a lot of money and we know sports in general  the value of those have ballooned but for now  netflix is getting into the game i forgot that bridger was back oh  yeah  i watched the first episode last night that s  i mean  that s the weekend  but they re doing it in two parts though so you can t fully binge it  which is  yeah  which is a strategy that they ve been doing there you go all right  we can talk to you forever but the police are yelling at me thank you so much really appreciate you as always well  nvidia shares are surging so far this year up over 90  year to date and investors eagerly awaiting those first quarter results coming up next week here s a look back at the company s rise stocks are poised to end the week higher all three major averages hovering near their record highs the s and p 500 just above the 5300 level  the dow just under that 40 000 level but the star of the show this week is the dow briefly passing that critical 40 000 mark on thursday so we want to zero in on the big names that drove that rally stocks that doubled the dow since 2017 among the winners  apple at the top united health health  microsoft caterpillar and goldman sachs these are really the names to watch because of the degree to which they drove this rally but having said that shaw of the dow is like such a funny little index because it s more of an average of prices rather than it doesn t weigh things correctly one could argue and the company waiting in the index are so different than their market cap so when you look at a name like apple has having a lower waiting than home depot  that s just  yeah  certainly it s  it s an interesting to point out it s important to point out and i think that s why so many investors really were talking a lot about the s and p and the movements that we re seeing there versus focus specifically on the dow and the dow components  which obviously a shift going back many  many  many years but i think that when we talk about 40 000  the level of 40 000 that milestone  what it means psychologically  i think there is reason to be excited about it clearly  my take away from the conversations we have been having with so many strategists here at yahoo finance over the last week is hey  when we are at the out the the levels that we are currently at and valuations are as high as they are yes  we are due for a pullback  right it s not exactly going to be just up and away from here at these levels with the dow at 40 000  with the s and p right around 5300 but there is still reason to be optimistic just about what that action could look like between now and to end so maybe we should be ready for a pullback we could get a pull back around 5  but then we also could reverse and trend higher that s actually viewed as being healthy here for the market so my takeaway is that yes  there s a lot to be excited about when you talk about 40 000 there s also reason to be a little bit hesitant or questioning the current levels  the current value viewing a potential blowback as healthy here for the broader markets and then ultimately  like brian bowski  where we started the show saying there s reason to think and reason to believe that we could see the s and p hitting 5600 by the end of the year  5600 hats get them ready all right well  coming up is wealth dedicated to all of your personal finance needs our very own brad smith is gonna have you for that during the next hour so stay tuned ',

                        "Tesla (TSLA) has been trying advance its self-driving technology in China, but it needs to comply with local regulations. As part of its push, the company is looking to process data gathered in China at a Chinese data center in order to avoid running afoul of regulators. According to the report from Reuters, the company has also been trying to secure approval to transfer data outside of the country for processing.Yahoo Finance Autos Reporter Pras Subramanian explains why this is an important move for Tesla.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Catalysts.This post was written by Stephanie Mikulich.Video TranscriptTesla is reportedly moving ahead with its plans to build a data center in China.It could be used to help develop the self driving algorithm that is according to reporting from Reuters.For more, we're going to bring in our very own pro Romanian.This is a really big deal.What do we know so far?Well, it's actually a bit wrinkle here.It's not much of they're building a data center is that they're actually using the data there and they can't bring it to the US, they had to or or or already have a data center in China for their, you know, the the local regulations about data collection.So the the key was is that Musk wanted to bring all that data from the, from China to the US to train the self driving A I ALGO, right?Can't do that.So now according to Reuters is reversing course and said, OK, we'll we'll build well, data center stays here, the data stays here.We'll train the algorithm in China.I mean, it's it's important because that's where the most cars in the world with, with, with the FSD type sensors are in China.Um you have also have a lot of mapping technology or a lot of other partners there that are, that are gonna share data.So he's saying potentially, what if we train the Algo there in China and then take that information and spread it elsewhere, right?That's sort of like the kind of the, the pivot here.Uh There's some risk there, you know, with, with China, you never know when they can lock you down, you never know when they can say, you know what we're gonna stop you here.So it's, it's kind of a risk.But also I think he sees that as an opportunity, you know, they use the the Reuters article notes that China Giga factory became the leading factory there for them.And that wasn't necessarily going to be the case when people thought about them creating that factory there.So maybe China is the push, maybe China is the sort of the angle for where they're going to attack FSD.Story continuesIs this a strategy that you think?Do analysts think that it makes sense in terms of Tesla's longer term goals in trying to increase that widespread adoption?II I, yeah, I think there's two parts, right?I think, yes, because it's a big market, there's it's sort of widely mapped other players like Baidu already doing that stuff there and you can kind of work together with.But the problem is that they, they don't necessarily own the data potentially, right?Also, there's a mention of how you can't sell these NVIDIA chips in China because they're, they're banned.So how do you get around that?They need those chips to, to build a data center and to train the allo.So um but yeah, I think they're right, there is an opportunity but also some risk.",

                        "If you've been keeping up on Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) lately, you've probably only seen negative headlines. With headwinds forming in the electric vehicle (EV) market, multiple rounds of layoffs, and some rumors that it would be scrapping its highly anticipated sub-$25,000 model, Tesla hasn't been able to catch a break.With the bad news piling on and investors having their fortitude tested, it's worth asking: Is Tesla still a good long-term option?Image source: Tesla.Analyzing Tesla's valueCompared to other automakers, Tesla stock is considered expensive and overvalued. We can see this by comparing the P/E ratios of companies.Today Tesla's P/E ratio is at 42. This is five times more expensive than the second-most-valuable automaker, Toyota, and roughly twice as expensive as China-based fellow EV maker BYD.TSLA PE Ratio data by YCharts.Even with its generous margins and the ability to mass-produce EVs efficiently, Tesla's stock isn't worth buying from a pure automotive perspective. However, when viewing Tesla from the context of its future endeavors, its potential begins to shine through and hints that it is currently trading at a discount.Many consider Tesla the best investment opportunity to gain exposure to the future potential of artificial intelligence (AI), despite the need for further development before the company can benefit from its labor.The road ahead is why Tesla is undervaluedCEO Elon Musk's goal is to make Tesla the most valuable company in the world one day. And it will do that by making its full self driving software more capable and increasing the capabilities of its humanoid robot Optimus.On the self-driving side of things, Musk's goal is to eventually launch a robotaxi service. With vehicles that are able to drive themselves, Musk plans to create a one-of-a-kind ride hailing business that could change how we travel. He sees it as an opportunity with \"quasi-infinite\" demand, and many analysts agree that it will be an inflection point.It is difficult to quantify the true potential for a technology that doesn't exist anywhere else in the market, but ARK Invest took a stab at it. After running a Monte Carlo simulation, the investment firm found that robotaxis could generate up to $440 billion in revenue, roughly four times greater than total revenue in 2023.As for Optimus, the potential is still commendable, albeit not quite as significant as robotaxis. Morgan Stanley analysts believe that Optimus could disrupt up to 30% of the global labor market with its ability to perform repetitive and dangerous tasks currently performed by humans. From a revenue perspective, Musk foresees Optimus surpassing its vehicle manufacturing one day.Story continuesOptimus is currently already in use at Tesla factories performing basic tasks. But Musk believes it will increase its responsibilities by the end of this year, and will be able to be shipped to consumers and markets by the end of 2025.The opportunity at hand todayFrom a pure EV perspective, it might be difficult to justify an investment in Tesla. While it will continue to increase its EV production capabilities in years to come and will benefit from increasing adoption of EVs around the world, the true potential for Tesla is from its AI endeavors.It might not be wise for risk-averse investors to invest in Tesla as it works through challenges in the short term, but for those with a long-term horizon and an appetite for risk, it could be argued that there are few better options than Tesla.Beyond Tesla's fundamentals, it's worth remembering the advice given by one of the world's most prominent investors, Warren Buffett. He famously said, \"Be greedy when others are fearful, and fearful when others are greedy.\" With a quick search across the internet, it's clear that there is fear when it comes to investing in Tesla today.While bad press isn't reason enough to invest in a company, when considering Tesla's history of success, the progress it's made in developing its AI products, and the transformative potential these technologies could have on society, Tesla appears to be a solid long-term option for growth investors.Where to invest $1,000 right nowWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

It represents about 2% of the fund’s holdings, Ark Chief Futurist Brett Winton said in an interview. The purchase comes a month after the fund disclosed a position in OpenAI that made up roughly 4% of its holdings. The closed-end interval fund also has a stake in AI firm Anthropic, accounting for about 5% of assets.“xAI’s access to X’s distribution and real-time data differentiates it from any other AI play, particularly when combined with Elon Musk’s maniacal focus on velocity,” Winton said by phone. “AI foundation models are going to be worth multiple trillions of dollars by the end of this decade.”Launched in 2023, xAI announced in a blog post on May 26 that it raised $6 billion via a series B funding round. Musk has been an early supporter of AI and at one point backed OpenAI before it introduced ChatGPT in late 2022.Wood’s Ark Venture Fund, launched in September 2022, invests in both public and private firms — including Musk’s SpaceX, Epic Games, Freenome Holdings and Relation Therapeutics. Private companies make up around 80% of total holdings.Wood catapulted to fame during the pandemic after making big bets on firms including Tesla Inc., and is known to be a longstanding Musk bull.

                        "Thanks to Elon Musk, the “single greatest talent acquisition opportunity in the industry” fell right into the lap of Aaron and Stephanie Luque—and they weren’t about to let the opportunity pass them by.When the couple first founded their Georgia-based EV infrastructure company, EnviroSpark Energy Solutions, Aaron would go to their local Tesla showroom in Atlanta, hoping to get work setting up home charging for new customers.Now, Musk’s carmaker would once again help EnviroSpark by sacking its entire Supercharger team just when the husband-and-wife duo was desperate for new workers.“The day before we had closed the biggest raise in the company’s history, $50 million,” remembers Luque, telling Fortune the task of recruiting to fill all the headcount they needed appeared daunting.When he learned of Tesla's bloodbath, he was shocked.Access to the vast and reliable network of Superchargers—with its seamless integration and premium charging experience—was one of the most potent arguments why customers should buy Musk’s cars rather than a competitor’s.On a private level, it was also tough because Luque had counted many employees as his friends.“Every single person that I ever knew or loved at Tesla had been let go. They shared the same mission as us, they lived and breathed EV charging,” he adds.One of those was George Bahadue, formerly senior manager for site acquisition and business development at Tesla.“To my network, you've hit the jackpot—Tesla charging employees are a special breed, resilient and the best in the business. I highly encourage you to consider them as you build your teams and carry on the charging mission,” he posted to LinkedIn earlier this month.Tesla still plans to grow the Supercharger network, just at a slower pace for new locations and more focus on 100% uptime and expansion of existing locations— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 30, 2024Quick-thinking founders seize the momentLuque’s wife seized the moment—reaching out to Bahadue on LinkedIn to say EnviroSpark was hiring for multiple roles and setting up an email hotline for Tesla employees.The EnviroSpark homepage also added a pop-up banner urging former Tesla Supercharger staff to apply for their open positions.According to Aaron, the company's CEO, over 100 resumes have been received since then. Given that the Tesla team only numbered around 500 globally, that’s a pretty good batting average for the quick-thinking duo.Story continuesThe first major talent acquisition is already in the bank.Joe Williams said he was genuinely at a loss for words when he lost his job as Tesla’s Southeast Supercharging lead, based in EnviroSpark’s hometown of Atlanta.Only two weeks later, he was “beyond thankful” after being named EnviroSpark's new senior vice president of business development.Just to reiterate: Tesla will spend well over $500M expanding our Supercharger network to create thousands of NEW chargers this year.That’s just on new sites and expansions, not counting operations costs, which are much higher.— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 10, 2024In Aaron Luque's mind, it’s the closest thing to a win-win situation, given the circumstances.Musk gets his layoffs, their company can grow, and a number of talented employees can land on their feet. Even Tesla won’t suffer since the company is so far ahead when it comes to the Supercharger network that there is no threat in sight.According to figures from the website EVAdoption, Tesla operates over 12,580 fast charging ports across well over 1,000 locations in the United States, compared to number two Electrify America, which has just 3,112 ports.“Anybody looking to scale something that would be able to compete with Tesla, it would take a significant amount of time to catch up, and they would be able to see that coming in advance and adjust accordingly,” Aaron Luque says.No need to replace every gas station with fast chargersEnviroSpark isn’t looking to take on Tesla directly, either.In fact, Aaron Luque is likely to agree with Musk to a degree since the former is convinced that replacing every gas station with fast chargers is for birds.That’s because EV owners plug in when they get home in the evening and wake up to a full battery.Luque argues that rolling out the far less expensive slow chargers in apartment complexes and other multi-unit housing, where the true gap in charging infrastructure can be found, is the real value to be had.Not only would the added convenience spur EV adoption, as owners would no longer need to drive to a fast charger, but it would also benefit utilities. That is because it shifts the load away from daylight hours to off-peak nighttime charging, which puts less strain on the grid.But Musk’s decision to release all of Tesla’s charging talent into the wild in one fell swoop did come with some downsides for Luque.EnviroSpark's work for Tesla has ground to a halt, confirming other similar instances reported in the press.“We had 26 open projects with Tesla at the time this happened, and we’ve received no communication since then about what we need to be doing,” he says.\"We’re in a holding pattern until somebody takes over there.”https://t.co/ozSpnbnch8 pic.twitter.com/EEJOX0Cakv— simon sidespin 🇺🇦🇫🇮 (@SSidespin) May 14, 2024Given the chaos, it’s perhaps no surprise that Musk is hiring back a number of his previous Supercharging staff before companies like EnviroSpark offer them gainful employment elsewhere.Bloomberg learned that Tesla’s CEO has already convinced its former North America director of charging, Max de Zegher, to return.Amid blowback, Musk forced to walk back his hardline stanceSpeculation as to why Musk sacked his senior director for charging Rebecca Tinucci in the first place has centered around reports she had pushed back against deeper cuts.Tesla watchers reason that, on the warpath, Musk decided to make an example of her and everyone who worked for her.Tesla couldn’t be reached for comment, as Musk fired everyone in his public relations team years ago.However, the speculation around Tinucci's departure seems plausible as the leaked email announcing her exit explicitly warned managers not to disappoint regarding radical headcount reductions.Following the subsequent blowback among worried Tesla owners, Musk last week began walking back comments made in the immediate aftermath of the team’s sacking—ones in which he stated Tesla would now slow the expansion of its charging footprint and concentrate on existing locations.Just started a Supercharger Community https://t.co/o5QSGCfrp3— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 10, 2024First, the Tesla CEO promised to invest well over $500 million in the network that would add thousands of new charge ports before then launching a new Supercharger community on his social media platform X as a show of support.For EnviroSpark, Musk’s sudden layoffs came at the perfect moment.Now that the company has the means to grow its business, the Luques' biggest challenge is how to fill all the headcount it needs.“I honestly believe the timing could not have been any better,” Aaron Luque says.\"Right after we closed a financing round that gave us the resources, the very next day, the single greatest talent acquisition opportunity in the industry opens up.”As his brand new SVP for business development will attest, some sad stories do have a happy ending.This story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

                        "Nikola (NASDAQ: NKLA), a producer of electric semi trucks, saw its market cap hit $28.8 billion as its stock hit its record high of $79.73 on June 9, 2020. But at the time of this writing, it trades at about $0.56 a share with a market cap of $750 million.The stock collapsed after the company missed its own production estimates; its founder and former CEO, Trevor Milton, was convicted of securities and wire fraud; and it recalled nearly all of its trucks following a series of battery fires in 2023. Persistent losses and an ugly balance sheet also made Nikola an easy target for the bears as interest rates rose.Image source: Nikola.Nikola still faces a lot of challenges, but could it stabilize and grow into a $1 billion company again by the end of 2025? Let's take a contrarian look at the struggling company and see if it has a shot a joining the three-comma club again.Nikola's expectations vs. realityNikola develops two types of electric semi trucks: battery-powered ones (BEVs) and hydrogen-powered ones (FCEVs). Prior to going public by merging with a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) in June 2020, Nikola claimed it could deliver thousands of trucks over the following three years. But this is what actually happened:Metric202120222023BEVs delivered (estimate)6001,2003,500BEVs delivered (actual)013179FCEVs delivered (estimate)002,000FCEVs delivered (actual)0035Data source: Nikola.Nikola blamed its sluggish start on supply chain constraints and other macro headwinds, but it had clearly set the bar too high. It also struggled to maintain a consistent strategy under four different CEOs over the past four years.Meanwhile, financial losses are widening at an alarming rate as Nikola takes on more debt and issues more shares to raise fresh cash. In 2023, it generated just $36 million in revenue but racked up a staggering net loss of $966 million. It still held $378 million in cash and equivalents (including restricted cash) at the end of the first quarter of 2024, but only because it issued new shares at a discount, doubled its existing share count, and issued more debt over the past year.But don't overlook its potential turnaroundThose ugly numbers make Nikola a tough stock to recommend. In its defense, the business has recovered from its recent recalls and its production rates are stabilizing. It shipped 40 FCEV trucks in the first quarter of 2024, representing a 29% jump from a year earlier.Nikola's CEO Steve Girsky, who took the helm in August 2023, expects Nikola to generate \"$150 million to $170 million\" in total truck revenue in 2024. That would exceed the consensus forecast of $123 million and represent 317%-372% growth from 2023. Girsky expects about $10 million to $12 million of 2024 revenue to come from its FCEVs.Story continuesNikola aims to deliver 300-350 trucks this year, and it expects its deliveries to accelerate in 2025 and 2026. During the first-quarter conference call, Girsky predicted that acceleration, along with its tighter spending, would pave the way toward \"positive cash generation\" with a \"positive gross margin.\"At the same time, Nikola continues to expand its hydrogen charging network with its partner, Voltera. It plans to open 14 of those stations by the end of 2024 to support its fledgling fleet of FCEVs.Could Nikola become a billion-dollar company again by 2025?With a market cap of $750 million, Nikola trades at about 5 times its estimated revenue for 2024. By comparison, Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) -- which is emerging as a major competitive threat with its own Tesla Semi -- trades at 6 times this year's sales. But there's a key difference: Tesla has already ramped up its production and is generating consistent profits.But for 2026, analysts expect Nikola's revenue to roughly triple to $457 million as it scales up its BEV business and delivers more FCEVs. Nikola trades at less than 2 times that estimate, while Tesla trades at 5 times next year's estimated sales.So if Nikola can successfully scale up its business and match analysts' estimates for 2025 and 2026, it has a clear shot at joining the billion-dollar club again. If it's trading at just 2.5 times its forward sales by the end of 2025, its market cap would reach $1.14 billion -- which would represent a 50% leap from its current price.However, Nikola still needs to prove that it can ramp up its production, narrow its losses, and widen its competitive moat. In other words, Nikola's stock could still head a lot higher -- but it could plunge even lower if the business disappoints its investors again.Should you invest $1,000 in Nikola right now?Before you buy stock in Nikola, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nikola wasn’t one of them.

                        "Goldman Sachs has observed a significant shift among the top technology companies, often dubbed the \"Magnificent 7,\" following their first-quarter results.Collectively, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)., Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)., Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc., Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)., Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. saw their profits increase by 48% year-over-year.This growth was supported by a 14% increase in sales and a margin expansion of 521 basis points, bringing the aggregate margin to 22.8%.However, this overall performance conceals the varying fortunes of the individual companies, the analysis showed.Meta Platforms, Alphabet, and Amazon outperformed expectations with sales growth of 27%, 15%, and 13% respectively, leading to year-to-date share price increases of 34%, 25%, and 21%. These gains reflect a stronger market performance for these companies relative to some of their peers.In stark contrast, Apple's sales saw a 4% decline, while Tesla experienced a 9% drop in revenues. Consequently, their stock prices have been impacted, with Apple's shares dipping by 1% and Tesla's plummeting by 30%.This downturn has led to Tesla's ranking falling to the 12th largest stock in the S&P 500 index.\"The sobriquet “Magnificent 7” needs to be retired following 1Q results,\" Goldman Sachs analysts said in a note.The report added that wide dispersion in performance highlights the diverse challenges and opportunities faced by these industry leaders.While some continue to expand and beat market expectations, others are navigating more difficult economic conditions.The upcoming NVIDIA results will add another piece to the puzzle of the tech industry's current landscape.Related ArticlesThe 'Magnificent 7' term needs to be retired after Q1 earnings: Goldman SachsInsiders share the best and worst things about working at AmazonBiden vs Trump: Evercore ISI offers outlook for fed funds rate in each scenario",

                        'DELAWARE (Reuters) - The Delaware judge who voided Elon Musk\'s record Tesla pay package told the parties in the case that she felt assured by the electric vehicle maker that it would not use an upcoming shareholder vote to attack her ruling.WHY IT’S IMPORTANTThe shareholder legal team who sued over Musk\'s $56 billion pay package had asked Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick for orders to prevent their case from being undone in a Texas court.The company\'s shareholders vote next month to "ratify" the pay package that McCormick voided and to reincorporate Tesla in Texas.CONTEXTThe legal team for the shareholder said in a court filing in April that Tesla and Musk might attempt to undo McCormick\'s ruling in another jurisdiction, like Texas.Tesla called that "rank speculation" in court papers and said Delaware would retain jurisdiction over the pay dispute, comments that McCormick took as an assurance that the company would not attempt to work around her previous ruling.KEY QUOTE"If I have interpreted the defendants’ position incorrectly, then defense counsel - as officers of the court - are duty-bound to correct it. In the meantime, the defendants’ statements give me great comfort," McCormick said in her seven-page letter.WHAT’S NEXTTesla shareholders vote on June 13 to decide if they still want Musk\'s pay package and to reincorporate in Texas, where it has its headquarters, from Delaware, where the majority of large publicly traded companies have their legal home.McCormick must decide if the shareholder\'s legal team should get the $6 billion they requested from Tesla as a legal fee before Musk and Tesla can appeal. She has scheduled a hearing for July 8 on the legal fee.THE RESPONSEGreg Varallo, an attorney for shareholder Richard Tornetta, declined to comment.Attorneys for the company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.(Reporting by Peter Henderson; Editing by Stephen Coates)',

                        "Some campaigners oppose Mr Musk, the world's third-richest person, as a symbol of capitalism - Apu Gomes/Getty ImagesElon Musk’s Tesla has been given the green light to expand its Berlin gigafactory despite environmental activists taking part in huge protests at the plant last week.The local council in Gruenheide, the Brandenburg municipality where the Berlin factory is based, voted 11 to six to allow the company to expand the facility, Tesla’s only European plant.The decision comes three months after local residents voted to block the expansion, which prompted Tesla to submit a scaled-down plan.The referendum was non-binding but the company had promised to revise its plans after the vote.Tesla’s Berlin gigafactory has become a hotspot for environmental and Left-wing protests in recent months, which culminated last week in scores of activists breaking through police lines to reach the walls of the facility.Several weeks earlier, the factory’s power supplies were vandalised, forcing it to stop production.A majority of councillors in Gruenheide voted in favour of the expansion plan, which is roughly half the size of Tesla’s previous proposal to clear around 250 acres of forest. The company hopes to double production to around 1m cars per year.The meeting featured demonstrations outside the local parliament, while those attending the meeting had their bags checked at the door amid a police presence.The expansion will still have to be approved by local environmental regulators and could be subject to legal challenges. It includes connecting the factory to a local train route to ease traffic congestion.Despite Tesla spearheading the electric car movement, many of the eco-activists have rejected car ownership altogether. They have claimed Tesla’s facility is polluting local water supplies and others oppose Mr Musk, the world’s third-richest person, as a symbol of capitalism.The approval vote was welcomed by Tesla and local politicians, including Brandenburg’s economics minister Jörg Steinbach, who said: “I am convinced that your decision is in the interests of your community.”However, the “Turn Off the Tap to Tesla” alliance, which has been marshalling protests, said it would continue to demonstrate against the company.Tesla’s Berlin factory was opened in 2019. The recent disruption to power supplies as well as shipping delays due to attacks in the Red Sea have slowed production in recent months.Read the latest updates below.06:00 PM BSTSigning off...Thanks for joining us today on the Markets blog. We’ll be back on Monday to cover the news in the markets but I’ll leave you with news that the proposed Royal Mail takeover is to face national security scrutiny. Tim Wallace reports:Story continuesThe Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky’s £3.5bn bid for Royal Mail will be scrutinised to ensure it does not threaten national security, Jeremy Hunt has said.Mr Hunt, the Chancellor, said it is vital there are “no risks” to “core infrastructure” when asked by The Telegraph about Mr Kretinsky’s plan to purchase the postal service’s parent company International Distributions Services (IDS).He said: “We do always look at national security considerations and make sure that, in terms of our core infrastructure, there are no risks to those going forward, and any bid for Royal Mail would go through that normal process.”IDS’s board has said it is minded to accept the offer by Mr Kretinsky, known as the Czech Sphinx for his inscrutable manner.Read the full story...A postman in London last month - Andy Rain/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock05:54 PM BSTM&S chairman hits out at British Airways after string of flights cancelledThe chairman of Marks & Spencer has hit out at British Airways, saying it was “sad to see a great airline deteriorate” after a series of flight issues. Hannah Boland reports:Archie Norman criticised the company in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, claiming his flight had been “cancelled then delayed” for the third time this year. He later deleted his post.However, Mr Norman’s assessment is likely to rankle given the M&S chairman’s stature in the business world. The City grandee is renowned for turning around underperforming businesses. He is credited with a revival at Asda while chief executive in the 1990s and is overseeing the current improvement at M&S.His criticism of BA came as the airline faced disruption on Friday morning caused by bad weather.A spokesman for British Airways said: “Like all airlines, due to restrictions imposed by Air Traffic Control at Heathrow Airport as a result of poor visibility, we’ve made some adjustments to our schedule.“We’ve apologised to our customers for the disruption to their travel plans and our teams are working to get them to their destinations as quickly as possible.”Mr Norman is the latest high-profile figure to complain of issues with the airline.Read the full story...Archie Norman, pictured in 1998 - Eddie Mulholland05:25 PM BSTCanada’s intelligence chief warns that China can use TikTok to spy on usersThe head of Canada’s Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) has warned against using the video app TikTok, saying data gleaned from its users “is available to the government of China”.David Vigneault, the CSIS director, told Canada’s CBC News: “My answer as director of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) is that there is a very clear strategy on the part of the government of China to be able to acquire personal information from anyone around the world.”A TikTok spokesman said:These assertions are unsupported by evidence, and the fact is that TikTok has never shared Canadian user data with the Chinese government, nor would we if asked.CSIS’s own annual report notably makes no mention of a specific risk from TikTok, but it does reference a number of other platforms that have been used by foreign actors to target Canadians ...Singling out one platform and making unsupported accusations does not make Canadians safer.In September, Canada ordered a national security review of a proposal by TikTok to expand the short-video app’s business in the country. Mr Vigneault said he will take part in that review and offer advice, CBC reported on Friday.Earlier this month, TikTok and its Chinese parent company ByteDance began legal proceedings in a US federal court seeking to block a law signed by President Joe Biden that would force the divestiture of the short video app used by 170 million Americans or ban it.The law, signed by Mr Biden on April 24, gives ByteDance until January 19 to sell TikTok or face a ban. The White House has said it wants to see Chinese-based ownership ended on national security grounds but not a ban on TikTok.David Vigneault at a parliamentary committee in Ottawa, Canada, 2023 - Justin Tang/The Canadian Press via AP05:25 PM BSTElon Musk to expand Tesla gigafactory rocked by Left-wing protestsElon Musk’s Tesla has been given the green light to expand its Berlin gigafactory despite environmental activists taking part in huge protests at the plant last week.

He told The Telegraph:While falling energy prices are, of course, welcome, it is important to note that they would have fallen much further had the Government not made such a hash of energy policy and loaded customer bills with the costs of their failure.The price cap caused dozens of retail energy companies to fail, the costs of the bailouts are included in everyone’s bills.Falling oil and gas prices exposed the 2022 lie that renewables were cheap. The subsequent collapse of the auctions was followed by the Government locking in higher prices for years to come.Add to this the expansion of the power grid, plans for boiler taxes, and heat pump targets and it is clear we should not be cheering what is mostly the result of global commodity trends - trends from which we do not fully benefit given the foolish decision to ban fracking and cripple North Sea investment with high taxes.04:57 PM BSTFootsie closes downThe was a bit more action among shares in London today compared with New York. The FTSE 100 closed down 0.22pc. The biggest riser was mining company Antofagasta, up 3.6pc, followed by another miner Fresnillo, up 3.4pc. The biggest faller was gambling company Entain, down 5.5pc, followed by equipment rental company Ashtead, down 4.5pc.Meanwhile, the FTSE 250 dropped 0.35pc. The biggest riser was Hochschild Mining, up 5.7pc, followed by Mr Kipling owner Premier Foods, up 3.7pc. Wizz Air was the biggest faller, down 4.5pc, followed by Savills, down 4.3pc.04:45 PM BSTWall Street takes a breather after rally from interest rate hopesWall Street’s main indexes were little changed on Friday as investors took a breather from the week’s rally driven by growing expectations of U.S. interest-rate cuts this year.The S&P 500 and Nasdaq were on course for a fourth straight week of gains, while the blue-chip Dow was on track for its fifth weekly advance, supported by strong quarterly results and slowing inflation data that has bolstered the case for rate cuts from the Federal Reserve.All three main indexes touched record highs on Thursday and the Dow Jones briefly crossed the highly symbolic 40,000 milestone, before reversing gains and closing in the red.Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth, said that shares “are just trying to sort of digest the past week’s economic data”. He added:People are now looking at the next catalyst. Most likely it’s going to be whether or not the Fed actually cuts. So you got PCE [personal consumption expenditures data] coming up, and if that’s below expectations then probably see the market continue to trend higher.Traders currently see a 68pc chance of the first rate cut in September, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.04:26 PM BSTRenewables are the answer to cheaper energy bills, says Left-leaning think tankWe’ve heard from Madsen Pirie of the Adam Smith Institute who is pro-fracking. But Maya Singer Hobbs, senior research fellow at the IPPR, a think tank much favoured by the Labour party, has a difference take. She told The Telegraph:The only way to ensure bills go down and remain down is to invest in renewable energy production here in the UK. This will reduce our vulnerability to external shocks and renewables are pound for pound cheaper than fossil fuels.Likewise, we need to fix the UK’s old, damp and energy inefficient housing stock by retrofitting our nations home with heat pumps and better insulation.03:58 PM BSTDon’t worry about Chinese batteries, worry about renewables, says expertChina’s electric car battery breakthrough, reported today, should be welcomed, but the West has another serious problem, a leading researcher on economic growth has said.Marian Tupy of the Cato Institute in Washington DC and author of Superabundance told The Telegraph:Assuming that the Chinese claims are true, the new battery should be welcome news to all who seek to reduce CO2 emissions.Those concerned about the Chinese manufacturing prowess should not be too worried. Innovation is a dynamic process that will allow non-Chinese companies to learn from the Chinese breakthrough and improve upon it.A much more serious problem is Western electricity production.Cheap and efficient batteries, after all, still need to be charged by clean electricity that wind and solar cannot currently provide in sufficient quantities.Expansion of natural gas and nuclear fission power plants, therefore, should still be a priority for Western decision-makers.03:51 PM BSTChina’s new battery technology will be used by military, warns expertWe reported earlier that China has developed a revolutionary car battery that can charge in just 10 minutes and power a car for hundreds of miles before it needs to be plugged in.Shane Mason, a defence industry strategist who has worked for two of Britain’s biggest defence companies, told The Telegraph:China’s new battery technology is going to propel growth in the country but almost certainly also be used for some sort of military application.This means that China is playing ‘Go’ – arguably a simpler game but more difficult to read - while the West is playing ‘Chess’, and waiting for a big move.This model worked when the West was in a much more powerful position in the world order where nations had to anticipate our next moves. In the current climate, we need to be responding far quicker.03:42 PM BSTCut energy bills further by rejecting pressure group politics, urges economistThe Government should push energy prices down by standing up to green pressure groups, an economist has said.Madsen Pirie, president of the Adam Smith Institute, told The Telegraph:Even though energy bills are falling, they are still too high, and higher than they need be because of government policies. The price cap on gas discourages the investment that could bring new supplies on line. The aim for net zero imposes the cost of more expensive renewables.But by far the most adverse policy is the effective ban on fracking. There is a huge store of cheap energy under our soil which is far less polluting than coal or oil, and which could be extracted to reduce all our bills and leave the UK less dependent on sometimes unreliable foreign sources. It is the height of folly that we allow pressure groups to deny us access to that wealth of energy03:36 PM BSTLinklaters hikes newly qualified lawyer salaries to £150,000Linklaters has become the latest City law firm to hike salaies in a so-called “war for talent”.The firm’s newly qualified salary has been raised from from £125,000 to £150,000.Trainee salaries increased from £50,000 to £56,000 for those in their first year of training, and from £55,000 to £61,000 for year two trainees. Solicitor apprentices salaries increased from £25,000 to £28,000.The salary rise, first reported by the FT, follows news that rival Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer had also hiked newly qualified lawyer salaries to £150,000.Paul Lewis, Firmwide Managing Partner, said:We are committed to rewarding our people competitively in our market. Our salary changes reflect this and enable us to attract and retain exceptional lawyers to provide the highest quality service to our clients.03:30 PM BSTHanding overThat is all from me for this week. Alex Singleton will make sure you have latest updates as you head towards the weekend.I will leave you with these stunning images of cotton picking in Australia, where the competition watchdog has raised concerns about the possible impact of a merger between traders Louis Dreyfus, known as LDC, and Namoi Cotton.A cotton picker harvests the crop near the town of Goondiwindi in Queensland, Australia - Ian Waldie/BloombergAustralia's competition regulator has raised concerns about a proposed takeover of Naomi Cotton by LDC - Ian Waldie/BloombergThe Australian Consumer and Competition Commission fears a merger would lessen competition for so-called cotton ginning services - where machines are used to separate cotton fibres from their seeds - Ian Waldie/Bloomberg03:16 PM BSTFTSE 100 on track for weekly lossThe FTSE 100 is on course for a fall this week after nearly a month of gains that has seen it hit record highs.The UK’s benchmark index was down 0.1pc on the day and by about 0.2pc on the week.The domestically-focused midcap FTSE 250 is down 0.3pc on the day but is on track for a fourth consecutive week of gains.Meanwhile, US stocks are drifting near their records as Wall Street heads for the finish of another winning week.The S&P 500 was basically flat in morning trading and on track for a fourth straight week of gains. The Nasdaq Composite was also virtually unchanged.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 57 points, or 0.1pc, a day after briefly topping the 40,000 level for the first time.02:53 PM BSTChina develops revolutionary electric car battery that can charge in 10 minutesChina has developed a revolutionary car battery that can charge in just 10 minutes and power a car for hundreds of miles before it needs to be plugged in.Our energy editor Jonathan Leake has the details:A report from the International Energy Agency (IEA) has hailed “remarkable” developments in chemistry that have allowed China to develop new batteries that pack far more energy than existing technologies.The IEA highlighted EV batteries capable of travelling 250 miles without a recharge. Newer versions announced since the report was written can manage 600 miles.However, the agency raised the alarm about China’s increasing dominance of the supply of vital materials needed to build batteries. The country’s stranglehold on supply chains means net zero rollouts globally could be disrupted by “extreme weather, trade disputes or geopolitics”.This chart shows how China dominates the battery supply chain.02:36 PM BSTWall Street edges higher amid rate cut hopesThe main US stock indexes opened slightly higher and are heading for weekly gains on growing expectations of US interest rate cuts this year.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 42.34 points, or 0.1pc, at the open to 39,911.72.The S&P 500 opened higher by 6.00 points, or 0.1pc, at 5,303.10, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 10.17 points, or 0.1pc, to 16,708.49 at the opening bell.02:25 PM BSTSilver hits highest price in a decadeThe value of silver has hit its highest level in a decade as investors seek out precious metals.Spot silver broke $30 an ounce for the first time since 2013, having soared by 28pc this year.The price of gold has risen by more than 16pc so far this year as it surged to record highs.Official figures show China and Turkey have been stockpiling gold since the start of the year.02:18 PM BSTHouseholds face ‘ongoing challenges’ despite expected fall in energy billsOfgem will announce the energy price cap for July to September on May 24.Craig Lowrey, principal consultant at Cornwall Insight, which predicts average annual bills will fall to £1,574 a year from that date, said:Our projections suggest that from July, the average annual bill will fall by around £500 compared to last summer, offering further relief given the quarter-on-quarter drop seen in April.Of course, we must recognise lower prices don’t erase all the problems.The very fact we are still seeing bill levels which are hundreds of pounds above pre-crisis levels underscores the ongoing challenges faced by households.01:52 PM BSTM&S chairman hits out at British Airways after string of flights cancelledThe chairman of Marks & Spencer has hit out at British Airways, saying it was “sad to see a great airline deteriorate” after a series of flight issues.Our retail editor Hannah Boland has the details:Archie Norman criticised the company in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, claiming his flight had been “cancelled then delayed” for the third time this year.Mr Norman’s assessment is likely to rankle given the M&S chairman’s stature in the business world. The City grandee is renowned for turning around underperforming businesses, credited with a revival at Asda while chief executive in the 1990s and overseeing the current improvement at M&S.His criticism of BA comes after recent figures revealed that the airline was one of the UK’s worst for delays and cancellations.Read how BA has been cancelling more flights than competitors.Archie Norman says he is 'sad to see a great airline deteriorate' - Adrian Brooks/Imagewise01:36 PM BSTEnergy bills to fall to lowest level in two yearsGas and electricity bills are expected to fall to their lowest level in more than two years as the energy crisis caused by Vladimir Putin’s decision to invade Ukraine fades.Our energy editor Jonathan Leake has the details:Energy bills should fall by around 7pc from July with the average dual-fuel household facing bills of £1,574 a year, according to the latest forecasts from analysts at Cornwall Insight.The prediction would mean that tariffs would fall by £116 a year compared to the price cap announced in April -

That is the big choice in British politics and our argument is this isn’t just about family budget.We understand how important those are when it comes to cost-of-living pressures.Our argument is this is about future growth of the economy, because we can see looking around the world that more lightly-taxed economies have more dynamic private sectors, they grow faster and, in the end, that is more money for precious public services like the NHS.09:19 AM BSTHunt will cut National Insurance in autumn if it is affordableJeremy Hunt has said he will cut National Insurance in the autumn if he is able to, as he sets out the Conservative Party’s economic pitch ahead of the general election later this year in a major speech in central London.The Chancellor said: If we can afford to go further, responsibly, to reduce the double tax on work this autumn, that is what I will do.”He has that Labour is taking the public for fools over the cost of the pandemic.Our political correspondent Dominic Penna is covering the speech live, and you can watch it below:09:06 AM BSTBank of England to move one in 10 staff to LeedsThe Bank of England will set up a permanent office in Leeds with at least 500 staff based there within the next three years as it aims to “better represents the people it serves”.The new base will be home to about a tenth of the Bank’s employees, although the move is not expected to increase its overall headcount.Governor Andrew Bailey, said:Leeds is a thriving city where the Bank of England has had a significant presence for over 200 years.Committing to a permanent, expanded Leeds office is a fantastic opportunity for us better to represent the public, build stronger links with the local business community and help promote the work of the Bank to a wider pool of talented workers.Tracy Brabin, Mayor of West Yorkshire, said: “This decision from the Bank of England is a major vote of confidence in our region, cementing our reputation as England’s leading banking capital outside of London, and opening up hundreds of local jobs for our talented graduates and professionals.”The Bank of England announced plans to create a northern hub in 2021 and opened an expanded office in Leeds at Yorkshire House, which currently accommodates up to 70 staff.The Bank of England, led by Governor Andrew Bailey, will move a tenth of its staff to Leeds by 2027 - Yui Mok/Pool via REUTERS08:54 AM BSTGSK sells last remaining stake in Haleon for £1.2bnGSK has raised £1.2bn after offloading its last remaining stake in Sensodyne and Advil maker Haleon, nearly two years after spinning off the consumer healthcare business.GSK sold the final shares in Haleon at 324p each, ending a gradual sell-down of its holding in the company.It has raised about £3.9bn in total from the stake sales, which first began in May last year.GSK said:Following settlement of the placing, GSK will have fully exited its position and will no longer hold any ordinary shares in Haleon.GSK’s exit of its position in Haleon is consistent with its previous commitments to monetise its holding in a disciplined manner.Haleon was formed in 2019 by the merger of the consumer healthcare businesses of British pharmaceutical group GSK and US rival Pfizer, sitting as a joint venture within GSK.It was then spun out of GSK as a standalone business listed on the London Stock Exchange in July 2022.GSK has sold off its last remaining stake in Haleon - REUTERS/Dado Ruvic08:37 AM BSTFTSE 100 inches down after rallyThe FTSE 100 edge down as investors await comments from Bank of England rate setter Catherine Mann later this morning.The blue-chip index was 0.1pc lower but was set for a fourth weekly gain.

                        "By Hyunjoo JinSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -Elon Musk is offering tours of Tesla's factory next month to 15 shareholders who vote on his $56 billion pay package, the latest effort by the electric vehicle maker to rally votes for the compensation after a court struck it down.The upcoming vote, whose result will be announced at the company's annual meeting on June 13, is seen as a referendum on Musk's leadership as investors worry that he is distracted by his other ventures and that his often controversial comments are weighing on the reputation and sales of Tesla.The company is making an unusual and public effort to rally support for Musk's pay. The company's board has justified the pay deal by saying it is necessary to make sure Musk prioritizes Tesla over his other commitments.Tesla has asked shareholders to reaffirm their approval of the record-breaking compensation that was set in 2018 but was rejected by a judge who found the package was negotiated by directors who appeared beholden to Musk.\"Don't delay, vote today!\" Tesla said on Tuesday.Led by Musk and other Tesla executives, the tour of the company's production lines for Cybertrucks and Model Ys in Texas will take place on June 12, the day before Tesla's annual shareholders' meeting, Tesla said on its website.The move is \"the last-ditch effort to try to charm retail investors,\" said Nell Minow, vice chair of ValueEdge Advisors, an advisory on corporate governance.According to S&P Global Market Intelligence, 44% of Tesla's common stock is held by nonprofessional shareholders including retail investors, the highest percentage of the 10 largest companies in the S&P 500.\"I think it just speaks to his grandiosity that he thinks that somehow being in his presence is going to have the results he wants. I don't think he's changing anybody's vote from doing this.\"Proxy advisory firm Glass Lewis said on Saturday it urged Tesla shareholders to reject the pay package, citing Musk's \"slate of extraordinarily time-consuming projects.\"\"His focus is clearly not just on Tesla,\" said Kristin Hull, founder of Tesla investor Nia Impact Capital who voted against the pay package.The world's richest person, Musk is also CEO of SpaceX, acquired Twitter in 2022 and started AI company xAI, which raised $6 billion in its latest funding.Musk owns around 13% of Tesla and exercising his stock options would result in his owning 22% of the company. He has threatened to build artificial intelligence products outside of Tesla if he can't get 25% voting power, which would require some of the stock options in the compensation deal.Story continuesBuilding AI projects outside Tesla could hurt Tesla's valuation which relies on its AI capability in self-driving technology. Musk said that the world's most valuable car maker would be \"worth basically zero\" without full self-drivingcapability.(Reporting by Hyunjoo Jin; Editing by Bill Berkrot and Cynthia Osterman)",

                        'Tesla and SpaceX Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk speaks at the SATELLITE Conference and Exhibition in Washington, Monday, March 9, 2020. - AP/Susan WalshThe world’s largest sovereign wealth fund has said it will vote against ratifying Elon Musk’s $56 billion pay award at Tesla, as the largest remuneration package in U.S corporate history comes under shareholder scrutiny, the Financial Times and CNBC reported on Saturday.Norway’s $1.7 trillion oil fund, the eighth largest shareholder in Tesla, according to LSEG data, and which owns 1.5% of all the world’s listed stocks, said on Saturday that it was “concerned” about the size of the pay package, its structure, and how it fails to mitigate “key person risk”.Most Read from MarketWatch‘I’m divorcing after a lot of heartache’: Should I suggest my husband keep his $200,000 401(k), so I can take our $360,000 house?‘He always managed to play golf’: My husband of 14 years never worked and now we’re divorcing.

Musk’s pay, the largest for a chief executive in corporate America, was approved in 2018, but voided by a judge earlier this year, who said the amount was unfair to shareholders, calling it an “unfathomable sum”.The Norwegian fund owns about 1 per cent of Tesla, worth about $8 billion at the end of 2023, and voted against the pay package when it was first proposed in 2018, and said its stance had not changed.Both ISS and Glass Lewis, the two largest proxy advisers, have also recommended shareholders reject Musk’s pay package.See: Elon Musk’s pay package ‘outsized,’ proxy adviser says, urging shareholders to say noSee also: America’s top pension fund to vote against Elon Musk’s $56 billion pay package, CEO saysThe oil fund has taken an increasingly active line against pay packages, particularly in the U.S., where it has voted against more than half of all awards of more than $20 million. Last year, it voted against pay deals at some of its biggest holdings including Apple AAPL, Google owner Alphabet GOOGL and LVMH FR:MC.The fund said it appreciated “the significant value generated under Mr. Musk’s leadership since the grant date in 2018”.Still, “we remain concerned about the total size of the award, the structure given performance triggers, dilution, and lack of mitigation of key person risk,” Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM), the operator of the fund said.Story continues“We will continue to seek constructive dialogue with Tesla on this and other topics,” NBIM added.However, it said it would vote in favor of Tesla moving its incorporation from Delaware to Texas, a move that was proposed as a result of Musk’s anger at the judge’s pay decision.The pay package — which was subject to Musk increasing Tesla’s share price significantly — was awarded in 2018 when the electric carmaker was struggling to produce vehicles at scale.The Norwegian fund also said it would vote in favour of a shareholder proposal backing trade union rights, which Tesla opposes. The vote comes as Tesla continues to face industrial action in Sweden, with its mechanics on strike since Oct. 27, in one of the country’s longest labor disputes.Tesla has previously said that the pay award has driven “more than $735 billion in value creation” and expressed confidence that its shareholders would “honor the deal they approved in 2018”.See also: ‘This is obviously not about the money.’ Tesla on why investors should back Elon Musk’s $56 billion pay award.Most Read from MarketWatch‘He married a manipulative, unlikeable woman’: My father-in-law, 85, named his wife as sole beneficiary to his $230,000 annuities.

                        "Tesla’s eight-biggest shareholder says it will vote against ratifying CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package which is up for a shareholder vote next week.Norway's $1.7 trillion sovereign wealth fund, which has been critical of excessive CEO pay, announced the move on Saturday.The fund holds a 0.98% stake in the electric vehicle maker worth $7.7 billion according to fund data. The fund is the largest wealth fund in the world and owns 1.5% of all the world's listed stocks.TESLA ASKS SHAREHOLDERS REINSTATE ELON MUSK'S PAY, MOVE TO TEXASPhoto illustration of Elon Musk in front of the Tesla logo.Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM), the operator of the fund, said the fund appreciated the significant value generated under Musk's leadership since the grant date in 2018 but remains \"concerned about the total size of the award, the structure given performance triggers, dilution, and lack of mitigation of key person risk/\"\"We will continue to seek constructive dialogue with Tesla on this and other topics,\" NBIM added.READ ON THE FOX BUSINESS APPThe fund also said it would vote for a shareholder proposal calling on Tesla to adopt freedom of association and collective bargaining policy, a win for labor unions seeking to assert their influence over the U.S. carmaker.Musk's pay was approved in 2018 but voided by a Delaware judge earlier this year who said the amount was unfair to shareholders, calling it an \"unfathomable sum.\"Judge Kathaleen McCormick of Delaware's Court of Chancery ruled in favor of a lawsuit brought by a shareholder to strike down the package and wrote in her decision that the package was excessively large as it was by far the largest compensation package for the CEO of a publicly traded company.ELON MUSK'S $56 BILLION PAY PACKAGE VOIDED BY JUDGEA Tesla automobile plugged in and charging at a charging station in the Silicon Valley town of Mountain View, California.McCormick also faulted the Tesla board of directors for failing to fully disclose to shareholders the close relationship between the directors who approved the compensation package and Musk, as well as the relative ease with which Tesla would achieve the benchmarks tied to tranches of his compensation plan given the company's growth at the time.Norway's sovereign wealth fund also voted against the package in 2018, while last year it voted against more than half of U.S. CEO pay packages above $20 million, warning they did not align with long-term value creation for shareholders.Should Musk’s payout go through, it would be the largest for a chief executive in corporate America.Tesla's board of directors proposed the reinstatement of the pay package, which has no salary or cash bonus and offers rewards in the form of stock options that are awarded based on Tesla's market value rising to as much as $650 billion over the 10 years following 2018. The company is currently valued at about $571.6 billion, according to LSEG data.Story continuesTesla has urged shareholders to reaffirm their approval of Musk's compensation plan. In an interview with the Financial Times earlier this month, Tesla board chair Robyn Denholm said that Musk deserves the pay package because the company hit ambitious targets for revenue and its stock price.However, Glass Lewis, a major American proxy advisory services company, last month urged Tesla shareholders to reject the staggering package, citing its \"excessive size,\" the impact of Musk exercising the stock options and the concentration of the company's ownership.Tesla co-founder and CEO Elon Musk verbally reacts at the unveiling of the all-electric battery-powered Tesla Cybertruck. The broken glass on windows following a demonstration did not go as planned on November 21, 2019 at Tesla Design Center in Hawthorne, California.It also cited Musk's \"slate of extraordinarily time-consuming projects\" which have increased following the acquisition of Twitter, now known as X, where Musk serves as chief technology officer and executive chairman. Musk is also the CEO of SpaceX and artificial intelligence firm xAI, and is the founder of Neuralink and The Boring Company.Musk has served as Tesla CEO since 2008 and has helped drive the EV-maker's rise to the most valuable automaker in terms of market capitalization.

                        "Elon Musk is playing catch-up in the AI race by ramping up his recruiting efforts for xAI, after investors valued the 10-month old startup at an eye-watering $24 billion.Even though Musk cofounded ChatGPT creator OpenAI in late 2015, he left the project after a disagreement with management and now finds himself in the rare situation of lagging behind competitors.But candidates need not apply for an xAI role if they disagree with Musk's brand of politics, since the entrepreneur hopes to differentiate xAI and its large language model (LLM) Grok from the Google Geminis of the world he feels are infected by a left-wing bias.“Join xAI if you believe in our mission of understanding the universe, which requires maximally rigorous pursuit of the truth, without regard to popularity or political correctness,” the mogul posted on his social media platform on Monday.Elon Musk said that if he gets 25% voting control of #Tesla, he will be comfortable with making Tesla the worldwide leader in AI. But how will that work if he owns xAI, which is also aiming to be the leader in AI? Wouldn’t there be a conflict of interest? https://t.co/Zwj6tvathL— Tesla and Doge (@TeslaAndDoge) May 27, 2024It came a day after venture capitalists, including Sequoia and Andreessen Horowitz, stumped up $6 billion in cash despite Grok not currently being included in the ranks of the top LLMs alongside OpenAI’s GPT, Anthropic’s Claude, Meta’s Llama, and Google’s Gemini. Investors are continuing to line up for Musk, even after his Twitter investment has cost minority investors like Fidelity to report it has lost almost three-quarters of the value of its stake.Nevertheless, Musk chose a controversial juncture to fundraise for xAI. Amid a slowdown in EV sales, the Tesla CEO has begun pivoting his carmaker away from its core mission of transitioning the world to sustainable transport. He now strives to lead the industry in what he calls real-world AI: self-driving cars and humanoid robots.That means Musk’s two companies may end up competing with each other for computing power and skilled labor, a fact recently highlighted last month when a Tesla manager quit to join xAI. Musk claimed the employee was going to leave anyway so he was not responsible for the brain drain, but it sparked concerns.Story continuesNeither am I. I would like this matter resolved.— Tesla and Doge (@TeslaAndDoge) May 27, 2024Fears over a conflict of interestMusk has been accused of treating Tesla like one of his privately owned companies where he can shift resources at will, as testimony in his pay deal case revealed earlier this year. A Delaware court in part voided his record compensation package from 2018 precisely because of claims that governance at the company is an afterthought, with the Tesla board sometimes only informed after Musk has already made a decision.“There’s rarely been as egregious a flaunting of independent shareholder governance as this,” New York City comptroller Brad Lander, who oversees five public pension funds with $242 billion in assets, told Fortune.Tesla did not respond to a request from Fortune for comment.CEO who already owns a $15b stake in competitive AI company demands $50b in compensation or else he will go and start a competitive AI company? 🤔— Rob Schmied (@rschmied) May 28, 2024At the Tesla shareholder meeting on June 13th, Musk will find out whether investors will once again approve the compensation deal that grants him the right to acquire 304 million shares worth $54 billion for $23.33 each, an 87% discount to the current stock price.Lander already signaled he would reject the board’s proposal, while proxy advisor Glass Lewis recommended this weekend all other investors do as well.Many of his supporters fear Musk would no longer feel sufficiently motivated to run Tesla in the event of a no vote, and would shift his focus to xAI, SpaceX, and social media platform X, formerly Twitter.This story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

                        'Updated at 9:36 AM EDTTesla shares edged lower Tuesday, extending their year-to-date slump to around 28%, as investors continue to grapple with a key long-term risk tied to CEO Elon Musk\'s ambitions in AI technologies.Tesla  (TSLA)  shares have shed nearly $230 billion in value this year as the electric-vehicle maker faces headwinds tied to fading EV demand, higher interest rates, supply chain disruptions and a dearth of new model launches.A broader risk to the group\'s longer-term prospects has emerged this year as well, tied to the fortunes of a disputed $55.8 billion pay deal that Musk and the Tesla board negotiated in 2018.Delaware Chancery Court Judge Kathaleen McCormick rejected the package last year, calling the package an "unfathomable sum." But Tesla continues to push for its approval in the courts, while Musk has moved to reincorporate the company in the friendlier regulatory confines of Texas.Shareholders are set to vote on the package for a second time on June 13, as the board looks to buttress its Delaware appeal. But with the stock in a tailspin and Musk distracted by his myriad interests beyond Tesla, the chances of its receiving support are starting to dwindle.Tesla CEO Elon Musk is looking for shareholder approval for a $55.8 billion pay deal that was first reached in 2018.Apu Gomes&sol;Getty ImagesShareholder proxy service Glass Lewis in fact issued a report on May 26 urging shareholders to reject the proposal, citing its "excessive" size, dilutive effects on the share count, and the "slate of extraordinarily time-consuming projects" that continue to demand Musk\'s attention.Musk to investors: Pay me or ... ?Glass Lewis also advised shareholders to reject Musk\'s plans to incorporate Tesla in Texas, arguing it offers "uncertain benefits and additional risk."The push on Musk\'s pay deal comes at a crucial time for the group as Tesla has tested investor patience with plans to switch focus from its traditional car-making roots to developing a fleet of autonomous robotaxis, which Musk has promised to unveil for the first time this summer.Musk has long argued that Tesla\'s ultimate fate lies in the use of advanced artificial-intelligence technologies, which will power the group\'s self-driving software. And he has said he needs broader control of the group to make that happen.Related: Tesla\'s big China problem may be spreading to Europe"I am uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI & robotics without having ~25% voting control," Musk said earlier this year. "Enough to be influential, but not so much that I can’t be overturned."Story continues"Unless that is the case, I would prefer to build products outside of Tesla," he warned.Musk currently owns around 13% of Tesla following a series of major share sales to fund the $44 billion purchase of the social media website X in 2022.In a move that some consider a shot across the shareholder bow, Musk\'s artificial intelligence startup, xAI, said that it raised a fresh round of capital on May 26. The round was backed by the venture-capital investors Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia Capital.Join xAI if you believe in our mission of understanding the universe, which requires maximally rigorous pursuit of the truth, without regard to popularity or political correctness https://t.co/jWEGDDnVk1— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 27, 2024The $6 billion infusion, which came as part of a Series B funding round, could value xAI at as much as $24 billion and accelerate the group\'s push to challenge market leaders such as Open AI\'s ChatGPT.Step into the DoJo with MuskXAI isn\'t Musk\'s only foray into the AI world, however. Tesla has continued to develop the DoJo supercomputer as part of the group\'s effort to both finalize its self-driving ambitions and power its nascent robotaxi fleet."The way to think of Tesla is almost entirely in terms of solving autonomy and being able to turn on that autonomy for a gigantic fleet," Musk told investors in April. "And I think it might be the biggest asset-value-appreciation history when that day happens when you can do unsupervised full self-driving."Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas says DoJo could add more than $500 million to Tesla\'s market value while boosting the prospects of its full-self-driving system, its broader network and mobility services, as well as its battery, energy and insurance divisions.More Tesla:Tesla tech beloved by investors has a big problemElon Musk fired Tesla’s Supercharger team for a strange reasonAmid new Biden rules, BYD launched plug-in hybrid pickupGene Munster, an analyst at Deepwater Asset Management and a longtime Tesla bull, says the licensing of self-driving technology could generate as much as $20 billion in annual revenue within five years of the first agreement.Related: Tesla shares soar as Elon Musk returns from China with FSD \'Game Changer\'But a number of analysts say all those gains are tied to Musk\'s continued commitment to the group, and his ability to extract both cheaper capital and a fair compensation package. The weekend move to bring some of the former into xAI could test that thesis over the coming months.Tesla shares were marked 3% lower in early Tuesday trading to change hands at $173.86 each.Related: Single Best Trade: Wall Street veteran picks Palantir stock',

Six of the 10 biggest EV makers in the US saw sales grow at a scorching pace compared to a year ago — up anywhere from 56% at Hyundai-Kia to 86% at Ford. A sampling of April sales similarly came in hot.It’s a tale of two EV markets, where consumers are flocking to some brands in record numbers while turning their backs on those with inferior battery range, slower charging and high prices, said Stephanie Valdez-Streaty, director of industry insights at Cox Automotive. Delays of new vehicles, though temporary, added to the perception of a market running out of steam.“We’re still seeing growth in demand, just not at the same pace for every brand,” Valdez-Streaty said. “Right now Tesla doesn’t have new models, Ford doesn’t have a lot in the pipeline. But Hyundai, BMW, Kia, Cadillac — they’re really moving the needle forward.”GM sees 300% growth for 2024The two companies with the worst start to the year were General Motors and Tesla — both victims, in part, of their own product cycles. This year GM discontinued its most popular EV, the Chevy Bolt, before its replacements were ready, while Tesla Model 3 production was interrupted for a long-planned facelift to the car’s design. Excluding those two models, US EV sales in the first quarter grew a respectable 23% over a year ago, matching pace with global EV sales for the same period.For the rest of 2024, GM appears to be on the brink of becoming the biggest driver of EV growth in the US. The Detroit automaker has committed to electrifying some of its biggest brands, which are finally reaching production after years of delays. That includes a $35,000 Equinox SUV and its sibling Blazer, as well as Silverado and GMC Sierra electric pickups with up to 450 miles of range.Story continuesThese vehicles all rely on the new Ultium line of batteries from GM’s joint venture with LG Chem. Problems with those batteries, and with GM’s new EV software, tripped the brakes on the automaker’s EV plans last year. Had Ultium arrived on time, in the numbers GM had predicted, the mood around the US EV market might have been exuberant going into 2024.GM Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra says Ultium problems are in the rearview, and the company expects to produce 200,000 to 300,000 Ultium-based EVs this year, a potential 50-fold increase from the 5,800 Cadillac Lyrics sold in Q1. “I think it was overhyped and now it’s probably underhyped,” Barra recently said of the US outlook for EVs. “The truth is somewhere in the middle.”And for all the talk of an EV slowdown, many longer-term forecasts haven’t budged. In April, the International Energy Agency estimated that US sales of fully electric vehicles will soar to 2.5 million in 2025, from 1.1 million last year.The biggest source of uncertainty for the US outlook is the product pipeline at Tesla, which is responsible for half of the country’s EV market. Tesla relies on just two cars — the Model 3 sedan and the Model Y SUV — for 95% of its sales. It repeatedly slashed prices last year to maintain growth before its first-quarter slump.Tesla’s calendar of new-vehicle launches is essentially blank, apart from an aspirational Roadster supercar and a vague hint by Elon Musk last month of “new vehicles, including more affordable models,” coming next year. It’s too soon to gauge long-term demand for Tesla’s Cybertruck pickup, which is currently only offered as a $120,000 founders edition.In August, Tesla plans to unveil a self-driving “Cybercab” without a steering wheel. There’s plenty of uncertainty about the readiness of the underlying technology and about what will propel Tesla sales growth until it’s ready. Adding to the uncertainty is the state of Tesla’s high-speed Superchargers in the US. The company recently opened its network of more than 2,000 US charging stations to non-Tesla owners, who can access the chargers with an adaptor. But in the middle of that transition, Musk fired Tesla’s 500-person Supercharger staff as part of the company-wide layoffs. He has since clarified that Tesla will continue to expand the Supercharger network, albeit at a slower rate, and has hired back some of the dismissed employees.Mass production is keyTesla’s gap year leaves an opening for other EV makers, but there’s a self-fulfilling aspect to all the talk of an EV slowdown in the US. Some automakers are concluding from Tesla’s stumbles that they should hold back their own investments until there’s more market clarity, said Corey Cantor, an EV analyst at BloombergNEF. Instead they should be following the lead of Hyundai and GM: Aggressively introduce affordable EV models to build economies of scale.“Automakers are probably freaking out too much, as usual, but there is a bit of a Tesla issue,” Cantor said. “If they want to start taking market share, or even just perform at a high level, they need to start producing EVs at mass volume.”No car company besides Tesla has been able to produce a runaway EV success in the US — or sell more than 100,000 EVs a year across its EV lineup. This year Hyundai, GM and Ford are each on track to reach that 100,000 threshold of mass production, a potential turning point for US EV competition.Some of the biggest EV laggards are also jumping into the US market this year. Stellantis is expected to start selling its first electric Jeeps and Ram pickups and Hyundai is unleashing a diverse stable of EVs for its new factory opening in Georgia in October. Honda just started delivering the Acura ZDX and is building a production hub in Ohio for additional EVs coming in 2025. The list goes on.US and worldwide EV sales are both expected to grow roughly 20% this year. That’s less than the blistering 46% expansion the US experienced in 2023 — but that level of growth can’t be sustained for long. If the global market for EVs continued at this “slowdown” pace indefinitely, virtually all cars would be electric in a decade.Read More:JB Straubel Built an EV Battery Colossus to Rival ChinaRecycling Shatters the Myth of Electric Vehicle WasteHow Three High-Tech Countries Became EV LaggardsEVs Pass Tipping Point to Mass Adoption in 31 CountriesMost Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekNew York’s Biggest Produce Market Is at a Breaking PointElon Musk Still Has Friends in Silicon ValleyWhen Business Is Just a GameThe Six Choke Points That Can Upend Global TradeThe Dodgers Mogul and the Indian Infrastructure Giant That Wasn’t©2024 Bloomberg L.P.',

                        'In 2020, Elon Musk made a declaration: Tesla aimed to sell 20 million vehicles by the end of the decade.In 2021 and 2022, the company repeated this objective, which is twice the number of cars sold by Toyota, in its annual impact reports. The just-released 2023 report, however, has left the aspiration out.The downplaying of the ambitious goal comes as Tesla has seen sales slow and corporate revenues plunge. In the first quarter, net income at Tesla fell 55% from the prior year, and its gross profit margin was down by 17.4%.The company warned investors its vehicle sales growth “may be notably lower” than last year as it works on the launch of its next-generation vehicle and other products.One of those other products is a fully autonomous robo-taxi, which Tesla seems to be counting on for its next big revenue push. Musk has said the robo-taxi will be unveiled on Aug. 8, though there has been no announced release date yet (and Musk is notorious for being overly optimistic when making product proclamations).Price cuts have been unable to sustain consumer interest in the vehicles, but investors are hoping the release of the more affordable Model 2 version will give the company another sales boost. Earlier this year, Musk said those vehicles could begin production as soon as this year.“It’s not contingent on any new factory or massive new production line. It’ll be made on our current production lines much more efficiently,” Musk said during Tesla’s earnings call.Some analysts, though, say they will believe that when it actually happens.The company did not give a new estimate for sales in its impact report.This story was originally featured on Fortune.com',

                        "The Biden Administration's recent decision to impose new tariffs on Chinese goods impacted many sectors, particularly the electric vehicle sector. Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk expressed his disapproval of the new legislation — which raised tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles from 25% to 100% — despite his previous support for Chinese tariffs.In a statement, Musk said, \"Things that inhibit freedom of exchange or distort the market are not good.\"For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Catalysts.This post was written by Angel SmithVideo TranscriptTesla, Ceo Elon Musk says he opposes us tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles.Yahoo Finance spoke exclusively with President Biden after the announcement to raise the tariff from 25% to 100%.And this is what Potus had to say if we, we allow them to continue what they're doing to flood the market with evs that are incredibly cheap.They're not making any money on them deliberately doing it to put other people out of business for more on this.Yahoo Finance's very own.Akiko Fujita is here.Hey, Akiko, hey there, Brad.Well, those comments from Elon Musk came at a tech conference over in Paris and specifically, he said he was surprised when the US made this announcement saying that things that inhibit freedom of exchange or distort the market are not good.Now, it marked a bit of a shift in tone from Mus Commons back in January.Remember back then, he argued that tariffs were necessary saying that without them, Chinese car maker would demolish in his words, most other car companies in the world.Now all of this stems from concerns about cheap Chinese vehicles flooding global markets, squeezing out competitors while China does remain the largest market, Chinese carmakers have increasingly been making pushes into new countries as their home market slows down, slows down and they have been making inroads, particularly in Europe.They increased their market share over in the eu to 20% of the European market last year.That was from 16% the previous year.And they did that largely by price with Chinese car maker commanding a 30% cost advantage over European rivals.Now you've got the European Commission considering tariffs on Chinese car imports that by some estimates can range from 15 to 20%.The Rhodium Group put out a study estimating that tariffs would be to be as high as 55% to curb import imports and the concern is something similar could happen here in the US as well.Now, Elon Musk saying he doesn't necessarily want tariffs.That's something we've heard from other car ceo S as well.Story continuesClan is Ceo Carlos Tavares saying that tariffs aren't necessarily the answer because car makers compete in a global market just a few days ago.He was interviewed by Reuters saying that he believes these tariffs are, in his words, a major trap for the countries that go on that path and that ultimately Western car makers will need to find a way to restructure to be able to meet the challenge from lower cost.Chinese manufacturers specifically, Tavares said when you fight against the competition to absorb 30% of cost competitiveness edge in favor of the Chinese.There are social consequences.And the bottom line is this guys, when you think about what Chinese cars or Chinese EVs are selling for, you've got a price tag of roughly $10,000.If you look at something like Byd Seagull, even with the tariffs, they can still be cost competitive.So that's exactly what those like Elon Musk potentially but especially Cilento Cillo has been hitting on saying you've got to have a restructuring really rethink about how these car companies are structured because the Chinese carmakers are going to continue to make a push into new markets.They will have to go head to head with them at these very low price points regardless of where those tariffs land.",

                        "The advice service says the pay package has so far failed to sharpen Mr Musk's focus on Tesla - David Swanson/REUTERSOne of the world’s biggest investors has been advised to vote against a historic $56bn (£44bn) bonus for Elon Musk amid a looming battle at Tesla.Vanguard, the second largest shareholder in Tesla after Musk himself, is among clients of the advice service Glass Lewis to be sent a report encouraging it to block the pay deal.Glass Lewis described the payment as “excessive”, warning it would dilute the stakes of existing investors and concentrate power with Mr Musk.It comes ahead of a vote by Tesla shareholders on June 13, that risks throwing the future of the company into question.Investors signed off on the $56bn payment in 2018, provided Mr Musk hit certain targets.However, the agreement was voided in January this year by a Delaware judge who warned that Tesla directors negotiating the package had failed to fully inform shareholders.She also said the deal was “unfathomable” and suggested the board had been blinded by Mr Musk’s “superstar appeal”.On Saturday, Glass Lewis said that the pay package had so far failed to sharpen Mr Musk’s focus on Tesla as he pursued side projects including his Space X rocket venture and the takeover of Twitter, now rebranded as X.It said: “Mr Musk’s slate of extraordinarily time-consuming projects unrelated to the company was well-documented before the 2018 grant, and only expanded with his high-profile purchase of the company now known as X.”The report noted that while it was unreasonable to expect unwavering focus at all times, Tesla had become “reliant on the presence of one individual for its success”, and the lucrative pay deal appeared ineffective in keeping Mr Musk focused.Projects outside of Tesla had been attracting criticism and raised concerns over the risk to shareholder value, it added.The world’s largest maker of electric vehicles could choose to ignore the outcome of next month’s pay vote, as it is advisory.However if the carmaker’s board can illustrate the deal still has widespread backing, it may help launch an effective legal appeal against the Delaware judgement. Mr Musk vowed to move the electric vehicle giant’s legal incorporation to Texas after the ruling.Shareholders will also vote on this at the annual meeting in two weeks, but Glass Lewis warned it brought uncertain benefits and risk for investors.Mr Musk has threatened to develop artificial intelligence products elsewhere without greater control of Tesla, which is seeking to become an AI and robotics firm as well as a carmaker.If Mr Musk receives the pay package, his stake in the company will rise from 13pc to 20pc.Story continuesTesla’s board, which has repeatedly been accused of being too close to the eccentric billionaire, had suggested the record-breaking payout.The deal would set rewards based on Tesla’s market value rising to as much as $650bn (£513bn) over 10 years from 2018.At the time when it was agreed such targets appeared outlandish.. However, Tesla’s valuation went on to peak at more than $1.2 trillion during the 2021 Covid trading boom and it is currently valued at $571.6bn.Robyn Denholm, the chairman of Tesla’s board, earlier this month insisted that Musk deserved the package after hitting ambitious targets for revenue and stock price.Mr Musk became Tesla’s largest shareholder in 2004, the year after it was founded, and was named chief executive in 2008.Glass Lewis also urged shareholders to block the reelection of Mr Musk’s brother Kimbal to the board over independence concerns.It recommended re-electing Rupert Murdoch’s son James, the former chief executive of 21st Century Fox.Glass Lewis said that it raised several concerns over the pay deal in 2018 and while many had been addressed, most were still causing concern.The report said: “The excessive size of the award, both on a pure dollar basis and in terms of the dilutive effect upon exercise, remains very much top of mind.“The company’s provided rationale does little to combat these concerns given their proportionate magnitude.”",

Here's why.Video TranscriptElon Musk's famous optimism is just one of the reasons that Tesla shareholders voted to approve a pay package for the CEO that could be worth as much as $56 billion.I think just based on vehicle autonomy, we can we can 10 X 110 X the value of the company.Um, I believe that's what will happen.He believes that's what will happen, will it?Who knows?Where is Musk and the EV maker?Where do they go from here?Joining us now is Gotham Makana Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, lecturer and author of Picking Presidents.It's good to See you again, Gotham.So, uh, you recently wrote about that?You did not necessarily think that Musk is the right leader for Tesla right now.Shareholders seem to disagree, and they're willing to pay him for the privilege of having him continue to run Tesla for now.Story continuesWhat do you think That he now even has more of sort of carte blanche to run Tesla as he would like?Um, he won and it wasn't a close call, right?He won by a lot, and so there's no way he doesn't interpret this as A.He doesn't interpret this as something of a of a free hand, and he should.I mean, like shareholders who supported him even after a more than 50% drop in the style valuation of the company over the last few years.That's a pretty remarkable to be a statement of confidence on their part.And I just I just sort of what I said was it does not take anything away from the enormous scale of his achievements in building Tesla.And not just Tesla, right?Tesla is not his most impressive company.I would say that SpaceX so either one of these companies would be remarkable both on is even more so.It doesn't take anything away from the scale of those achievements.To say that the challenges that Tesla is facing now are not the same as the challenge that as the as the challenges that he triumphed over earlier, and it might take a very different skill set for those.And so go.Are you are are you implying then you know that that maybe they should.Some somebody on the bench at Tesla should be being groomed here to take take, uh, his role at some point.So So Tesla is unique, right?Because you cannot imagine Tesla without Elon Musk.I mean, like, you could say, you couldn't imagine Ford of that Henry Ford.But eventually that problem had to be faced.In Tesla's case.Well, I don't know.I don't know what Tesla's valuation would be without Elon, but it would be a lot lower.My suggestion would actually be a little different from that.It's that the board should take a much more independent and active role in the company.What I would say is that there is no genius, no such thing as a genius so brilliant that all of their ideas are good ones.Or even their good ideas can't be improved by pressure from other smart, capable people.I think the board has given him sort of total freedom to do whatever he wants in ways that you know, the last three few years of Tesla's performance, just that they're not working as well as they used to.And it's time for them to step in that, or for things like, you know, the cyber truck, for example, Maybe when that was decided to devote huge fraction of resources of the company to that, the board should have stepped in and said, You know, does this really make sense?Can you really make a case as to why do this?What's the analysis of why this is a good idea?And it would have turned out and maybe the decisions would have turned out a little bit different.It doesn't seem like there's any chance of that that imminently, certainly that that's gonna be happening.Um, and in the meantime, you know, he had made this threat against the company that he was going to take his attentions elsewhere if this pay package didn't pass.And now that seems to have dissipated.But just as a reminder, he runs a lot of companies, right?Tesla is not his only company.He runs a of course, there's SpaceX.There's Xa.I, um And so going forward, um, you know, does does this sort of draw him back to Tesla to some extent, because he did get this victory.I mean, it's hard to know.Remember that before this pay pack, this whole debate over this current pay package, he had actually said that his expectation would be that there would be another, even larger one that would be granted to him after this one came through.So I mean, he has sort of already said that this is not enough now that being once he said it like, it's easy to say that, Well, you mean it was that just a bargaining thing.But it's kind of a striking thing for him to say that having that 25% of the company is not enough.Um, I'll also say I it's a little hard to see how that threat is plausible.Tesla is by far his largest source of liquid wealth, and, you know, for him to monetize his assets.And SpaceX, for example, would be pretty complicated.Um, and so I'm not sure he has the ability to walk away.But he's Elon Musk.He does lots of things that no one else would do.I would never say anything is impossible.Um, I would be concerned if I was the board and I would look very closely at again the SpaceX model, right?So Elon does not run SpaceX on a day to day basis.That's when shot well, and she's done an extraordinary job, she is, by most measures, I think has a really good art company to be the greatest aviation executive of the last 50 years.Maybe more than that, um, it might be time for the board to say, Hey, if you want to spend your time on other things, let's find a win shot.Well, for Tesla, who can be your partner, not your replacement?",

                        "On June 13, I posted a story asserting that the giant run-up in its market cap to $3.1 trillion made it virtually impossible for Nvidia to grow its sales and profits at the lightning pace needed to reward shareholders.The same day, Cathie Wood, chief of Ark Invest, appeared on CNBC to champion her firm's new, breathtakingly bold, projections for Tesla's stock price. Wood posited that the EV leader's shares would hit $2,600 by 2029, almost fifteen-fold its current level of $175. In a report issued the previous day, three Ark analysts provided the financial metrics it expects Tesla to reach five years hence that justify that never-before-witnessed moonshot in value. Their work mightily impressed Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who tweeted, \"I think it's worth looking at Ark's analysis, I think that's the most accurate analysis.\"Stacking Nvidia's challenges versus Wood's stunning new Tesla prophesyComparing the heroics Nvidia must achieve to prove a good investment, and the feats Wood expects from Tesla, makes her forecast look like the bigger fantasyIn the Nvidia piece, I stated that to deliver its shareholders a relatively modest 10% annual return over the next seven years, Nvidia would most likely need to double its market cap to $6.2 trillion by 2031. I'll spare you the details, but I estimated that getting there would require, by the end of that timeframe, $200 billion in annual net earnings and $580 billion in revenues, for respective annual increases of 25% and 50%. Conclusion: The chances of dwarfing the numbers now posted by the likes of Apple, Microsoft and Alphabet are remote, to put it mildly. Put simply, investors have hiked the bar for what the AI-pioneer must achieve so high that it's most likely to prove a great company and a poor investment.The Ark report predicts that Tesla will achieve an \"enterprise value\" of $8.2 trillion in five years. Although enterprise value includes debt as well as equity, Ark appears to attribute almost all of that number to the latter. Hence, it's saying that Tesla's market cap will jump one-third higher than the required but fantastical $6.2 billion bogey for Nvidia in my \"roadmap for success,\" and do it far faster, in five years instead of seven! Tesla starts the contest sandbagged by a heavy handicap: It's earned just $13.7 billion the last four quarters, one third the $42.6 billion booked by Nvidia.The Ark analysis puts Tesla profits by 2031 in the $300 billion range. Getting there would require annual gains of 90% through 2029. That's almost four times the hurdle for Nvidia. Ark foresees $1.2 trillion in revenues for Tesla at the end of the five year window; ringing the bell would take annual increases of 65%, a growth rate far faster than the 50% needed to make Nvidia a decent buy at these prices.Story continuesBased purely on the scale of the numbers measured against what other tech greats have garnered and the size of Tesla's industry, the Ark estimates look far more outrageous than the over-the-top numbers baked into Nvidia's valuation. That $300 billion in 2029 profits would be three times what Apple earns today, and the $1.2 trillion in revenues would tower at five-times Microsoft's. Tesla's 2029 sales would equal the combined total for the world's five largest automakers, Volkswagen, Toyota, GM, Ford and BMW. At an $8.2 trillion market cap, Tesla would be worth four-fold the all-in valuation of the global auto industry.The goals investors have set for Nvidia, and Wood's stupendous outlook for Tesla, turn on the vision that a single player will dominate a revolutionary industry, facing little competition, virtually in perpetuity. For AI colossus Nvidia, that domain's already exploding, what's in doubt is the prospect of dominance forever. For Tesla, the business—robo taxis running on its super-lucrative software—doesn't exist yet, and whether and when it arrives, how profitable it will be, and whether King Elon can rule it alone, are all big questions.You've got to marvel at Wood for making a call that looks ridiculous based on anything we've ever witnessed in the financial markets, and Musk for praising the \"analysis\" behind the gravity-defying target. They might be true believers—but investors should do the math.This story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

                        "Donald Trump attends his criminal trial in New York yesterday - Mark Peterson/AFP via Getty ImagesDonald Trump has taken a $357m (£280m) hit as shares in his social media company dropped after the former president was found guilty of fraud.Shares in Trump Media and Technology Group, the owner of Truth Social, fell by 6pc on Friday.The drop knocks $550m off the company’s value. The Republican presidential candidate owns a 65pc stake in Truth Social that is believed to account for a majority of his net worth.Trump’s stake is worth $5.6bn, although he is unable to sell any shares until September due to a lock-up agreement associated with the company’s initial public offering in March.The drop in Truth Social’s shares is not as severe as might have been feared. They had fallen by as much as 14pc in closed-market trading immediately after Trump was found guilty of fraud on Thursday in his case involving “hush money” payments to a porn star.Truth Social features similar functionality to X and was set up after Trump was banned from the social network, then named Twitter, shortly after the US Capitol riots of Jan 6 2021. It allows users to post short messages, or “retruth” them to share posts with others.Elon Musk lifted the ban on Trump, once a prolific Twitter user, but the former president continues to exclusively use Truth Social, where he has 7m followers.TMTG has said in regulatory filings that Trump being convicted could “negatively impact” the company. While Trump does not have a formal role at the company, a guilty verdict could mean Truth Social finding it harder to attract advertisers.If it affects Trump’s chances of regaining the White House, it could also make the social network less influential. If Trump were to receive a prison sentence following his criminal conviction, he may be prevented from using the website.Observers have said that the company’s valuation is largely disconnected from its financial performance, and partly driven by retail shareholders supporting Trump.The company lost $327.6m (£256.6m) in the first three months of the year and had revenues of $770,500.Despite Trump exclusively posting on Truth Social, Mr Musk is believed to have been regularly speaking to the former president, in part to encourage him to return to X, where his account still has 87m followers.Mr Musk’s company is reportedly planning to host a video town hall event with Trump in the run-up to November’s US election.TMTG is run by Devin Nunes, a former Republican congressman and close ally of Trump. The former president’s son, Donald Trump Jr, sits on its board.Read the latest updates below.06:01 PM BSTSigning off...Thanks for joining us on the Markets live blog this afternoon. Chris Price will be back on Monday morning ahead of the London markets opening to keep you up to date.Story continuesIn the meantime, do check out our business coverage here.05:13 PM BSTEuropean shares rise after US inflation data keeps Fed rate cut hopes aliveEuropean shares rose on Friday, with the pan-European Stoxx 600 - which include some of Britain’s biggest companies - closing 0.3pc higher. But it still recorded a second week of declines as euro zone bond yields spiked to mirror their US counterparts on worries over interest rates remaining elevated.The index was up for the month, however.Data in the United States showed inflation tracked sideways in April, with the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index increasing 0.3pc last month, and up 2.7pc in the 12 months through April.David Russell, global head of market strategy at TradeStation, said:The PCE data confirms price increases aren’t as sticky as feared, keeping hopes of at least one [Fed] rate cut on the table.Meanwhile, euro zone inflation picked up in May, a sign the European Central Bank still faces a slow and uncertain journey to rein in prices.Samuel Zief, head of global FX strategy at JP Morgan Private Bank, said:The upside surprise was primarily driven by services inflation, ... that will be a cause for discussion at next week’s ECB meeting, but we don’t think it is a sufficient surprise to deter them from pressing ahead with a well-telegraphed 25 bps [basis points, otherwise known as a quarter point] cut.05:08 PM BSTFootsie closes upThe FTSE 100 closed up 0.5pc. Tge top riser was National Grid, up 4.7pc, followed by energy company SSE, up 2.3pc. The biggest faller was JD Sports, down 4.7pc, followed by Primark and Twinings tea owner Associated British Foods, down 4.7pc.Meanwhile, the FTSE 250 rose 0.3pc. The top riser was vending machine company ME Group International, up 5.2pc, followed by Aston Martin, up 4.8pc. Ferrexpo, the miner, was the biggest faller, closing down 6.6pc, followed by North Sea engineering business John Wood, down 5.5pc.04:23 PM BSTChoppy trading in American shares after new inflation dataIt’s a mixed picture in US stocks this afternoon, after the three main indexes opened up, before the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Compose made losses.The S&P 500 is currently down 0.5pc, while the technology heavy Nasdaq Composite has falled 1.2pc. However, the Dow Jones Industrial Average of 30 leading American companies is up 0.1pc.New data from the US Commerce Department showed inflation rose largely in line with expectations in April, fanning hopes that rate cuts were imminent from the Federal Reserve this year.Marc Ostwald, chief economist and global strategist at ADM Investor Services International, said:We shouldn’t go overboard. What we’ve got is after a few months of rising, [inflation] is finally going sideways and hopefully we’ll resume a downtrend as we go forward... but markets will be relieved because they are living in fear of bad numbers at the moment.03:42 PM BSTMagic circle law firm gives newly qualified lawyers a £25k pay boost in war for talentA&O Shearman has become the latest magic circle firm to give newly qualified lawyers a £25,000 pay boost to £150,000 in a war for talent.It follows the decision by magic circle rivals Freshfields, Linklaters and Clifford Chance to hit the £150,000 mark.The magic circle is the traditional elite grouping of British law firms, which are in a war for talent against deep-pocketed US rivals.A&O Shearman was formed at the start of May from the merger of Allen & Overy and Shearman & Sterling.A month ago, Allen & Overy was reportedly intending to pay newly qualified lawyers £125,000 in London after its merger with Shearman & Sterling, rather than the £145,000 offering by Shearman.Denise Gibson, A&O Shearman’s London managing partner, said:Our compensation structure gives us flexibility to reward expertise, performance and wider contribution and is designed to be highly competitive to reflect the markets in which we operate.Trainees and NQs [newly qualified lawyers] are a key part of the firm’s future and A&O Shearman provides unmatched opportunities for them to build successful careers.03:16 PM BSTTrump takes $357m hit as shares in Truth Social slump after guilty verdictsDonald Trump has taken a $357m (£280m) hit as shares in his social media company dropped after the former president was found guilty of fraud.Shares in Trump Media and Technology Group, the owner of Truth Social, fell by 6pc on Friday morning.The drop knocks $550m off the company’s value.

They had fallen by as much as 14pc in closed-market trading immediately after Mr Trump was found guilty on Thursday night.Mr Trump’s stake is worth $5.6bn, although he is unable to sell any shares until September due to a lock-up agreement associated with the company’s initial public offering in March.Truth Social features similar functionality to Twitter and was set up after Mr Trump was banned from Twitter shortly after the US Capitol riots in 2021. It allows users to post short messages, or “ReTruth” them to share posts with others.Mr Trump, once a prolific Twitter user, has been unbanned from the social network, now known as X. However, he continues to exclusively use Truth Social, where he has 7m followers.TMTG has said in regulatory filings that Mr Trump being convicted could “negatively impact” the company. Receiving a prison sentence, for example, could see him prevented from using the social network.Many observers have said that the company’s valuation is largely disconnected from its financial performance, and partly driven by retail shareholders supporting Mr Trump.The company lost $327.6m (£256.6m) in the first three months of the year and had revenues of $770,500.03:14 PM BSTPaddy Power owner’s finance boss quits as gambling giant shifts listing to USFlutter’s finance chief has quit after the gambling giant shifted its primary stock market listing to the US. Daniel Woolfson has the details:The departure of Paul Edgecliffe-Johnson was confirmed by Paddy Power’s parent on Friday, which coincided with the company completing its move from London to New York.Shares in Flutter fell by as much as 12pc following confirmation of the switch, which will see the business look to join American indices such as the S&P 500.The move will also see the Dublin-headquartered company retain a secondary listing in London.As for the exit of Mr Edgecliffe-Johnson, it comes just two years after he joined the business.In light of the move to the US, Flutter said it had recently held talks with the departing chief financial officer (CFO) about his family commitments in the UK.The company said: “Following this discussion, the board has concluded that it is in the Company’s best interests for Paul Edgecliffe-Johnson to step down from his role as group CFO and executive director.”Mr Edgecliffe-Johnson, who joined it in 2023 after spending almost two decades at InterContinental Hotels Group, will be replaced by Rob Coldrake, Flutter’s international chief financial officer.In recent years, the US has become an increasingly lucrative market for gambling companies after a Supreme Court decision in 2018 allowed states to start setting their own gaming laws.Flutter already owns Fanduel, one of America’s biggest sports betting companies, which has ensured the US is its biggest global market.Peter Jackson, Flutter’s chief executive, has previously called New York the company’s “natural home”.Flutter first began trading in New York in January via a secondary listing - Spencer Platt/Getty Images02:51 PM BSTTesla cars failed to warn passengers seat belts were not secureTesla will issue a software update to more than 125,000 cars to fix a fault in which the vehicles’ seat belt warnings failed to work. James Titcomb reports:The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which handles safety recalls, said that an error meant that the cars would not alert drivers when they were travelling without wearing their seat belt.Cars are required to sound alerts and give visual warnings when a car is moving without the driver’s seat belt being attached securely to the buckle.The NHTSA said that the problem potentially affected 125,227 Model S, Model X, Model Y and Model 3 cars, or around 2pc of the Tesla vehicles on the road.The fault had been discovered during safety tests by Tesla, and the company had identified 104 warranty claims by customers related to the issue.The NHTSA said the problem was down to a faulty circuit on the driver seat sensor but could be corrected by a software update that will bypass the component.Fixing the fault is referred to as a recall by US regulators but is accomplished automatically by an online software update.A Tesla Model S plugged into a Tesla Supercharger in the Virginia last year - Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images02:46 PM BSTSoho House rejects takeover approachSoho House has told investors that it has rejected a takeover approach, after setting up a special board committee to “evaluate certain strategic transactions, which included potentially becoming a private company”.The operator of a chain of private members’ clubs said that the offer “reflected a substantial premium over the current trading price”, but that it “did not adequately reflect the value of the company and was not in the best interests of its public stockholders”.It did not name the prospective buyer.Earlier this month, it released quarterly results showing that it had racked up losses of $46m (£36m), up from $16m a year earlier.Soho House, which began life as a club on Greek Street in London, floated in New York in 2021, raising $420m.

She told a press conference in CataniaLI think it’s really important that we do this, because it’s also signalling to the rest of the world, you should not build up capacity to think that you can own this market, because it’s so strategically important to us not to have single supplier dependencies.STMicroelectronics is the only company that has so far received state aid grants under the EU’s Chips Act, as major projects announced by Intel and TSMC in Germany are still awaiting approval. Ms Vestager said that is set to change:I’m absolutely sure that there will be more investments also in other states and I think they will also come relatively soon, but I cannot tell you [exactly when].Margrethe Vestager, EU competition commissioner, earlier this month - Krisztian Bocsi/Bloomberg02:22 PM BSTPandemic supply chain distruption still affecting airlines, says Delta boosThe boss of US airline giant Delta has told Bloomberg Television that supply-chain difficulties which developed in the wake of the Covid pandemic are still a problem for the airline industry.Ed Bastian, chief executive, said:The supply chain is not where it needs to be.It’s significant. It’s not just Delta, it’s the industry ...The result is that repair times take months rather than weeks, he said, with manufacturers still being affected by less experienced staff and components not being easily available.Last year, a manufacturing defect in geared turbofan engines made by Pratt & Whitney led to some airlines having to ground plans. Mr Bastian said that this is more significant that the effect of airline delivery delays by Boeing.He said:The engines are going to be a bigger issue, particularly for us the geared turbofan. That’s slowing down a little bit the new deliveries we can take, but its more engines than it is planes. What it’s causing us to do is maintain the existing fleet we have a little bit longer, and that’s another cost to the business.A Delta airlines airplane on approach to land at LaGuardia Airport in New York, 2022 - Justin Lane/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock01:55 PM BSTFamilies put record amount of cash into Isas in anticipation of interest rate fallSavers put away a record amount of cash into Isas last month in anticipation of a looming interest rate cut by the Bank of England.

Monthly inflation readings of 0.2pc over time are needed to bring inflation back to target.The Fed has kept its benchmark policy rate in the 5.25pc-5.50pc range for the past 10 months and was stung by three months of stronger-than-expected inflation and labor market readings from January to March after more encouraging readings in the fourth quarter of last year.01:43 PM BSTTruth Social shares climb despite guilty verdictShares in Donald Trump’s personal social media business Truth Social climbed as much as 5pc in pre-market trading on Friday as fans of the former president appeared undaunted after a US court found him guilty in a landmark hush money trial.The recovery follows a rapid sell-off after the Mr Trump was found guilty, recouping losses from the immediate aftermath of the New York jury’s verdict.Donald Trump vowed to “keep fighting” after he was found guilty of all counts in his New York hush money trial.Mr Trump, 77, now faces possible jail time for falsifying business records to cover up payments made to adult film star Stormy Daniels.

You have a department that does [those things] and you set a culture for what you want them to do.”Mr Lynch was on the witness stand in San Francisco defending himself against claims he was the “driving force” behind a criminal scheme to inflate Autonomy’s revenue prior to its takeover by HP.

Economists said the country’s property crisis continued to weigh on confidence among households and businesses as non-manufacturing activity also slowed.The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said its official manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) fell to 49.5 in May from 50.4 in April. This is below analysts’ forecasts and the 50 level that divides growth from contraction.Xiangrong Yu, an economist at Citi, said the closely-watched survey suggested the world’s second largest economy was in the grip of a deeper malaise.“Persistent demand weakness seems to [be] eroding production strength,” he said. Mr Yu suggested that interest rates should be cut and more government stimulus deployed to prop up demand.“The government has shot multiple arrows again to stabilise the property sector, but efforts will likely need to be scaled up,” he added.Kelvin Lam at Pantheon Macroeconomics said the fallout from China’s debt-fuelled property crisis had cast a long shadow over the economy.08:49 AM BSTMike Ashley’s Frasers builds £300m Hugo Boss stakeMike Ashley’s stake building in Hugo Boss has continued with Frasers Group snapping up more shares in the languishing German fashion retailer.Frasers said it had increased its position in Hugo Boss to £305m after a fall in the German business’s share price.Shares in Hugo Boss are down 27pc so far this year having dropped 13pc last week in a single day after reporting weak trading in China.Last week, Mr Ashley entertained fashion bosses including executives from Hugo Boss at Cholmondeley Castle in Cheshire.08:36 AM BSTJD Sports shares tumble 8pc on “challenging” marketShares in FTSE 100 sportswear retailer JD Sports have dropped 8.5pc so far this morning - the biggest fall among the blue chips in early trading - as the business blamed a “volatile” market for a fall in profits.JP Sports reported sales growth of 9pc over the year, but its profit before tax fell by 8pc to £973.9m. The business also said its first quarter UK sales were down around 6.4pc.Régis Schultz, JD Sports chief executive, said:We have started the new financial year with Q1 in line with our expectations in a volatile market and we are on track to deliver our profit guidance for the full year. Looking further ahead, we have a strong business model and a clear strategy to deliver long-term growth and value creation for our shareholders.08:16 AM BSTNationwide’s Virgin Money merger faces investigationNationwide’s £2.9bn takeover of Virgin Money is facing scrutiny from Britain’s competition watchdog, Michael Bow reportsThe Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) confirmed on Friday morning that it will examine the acquisition for potential anti-trust concerns, setting a deadline of July 26 to make its initial decision.Its range of options includes clearing the deal after a so-called first phase review, which lasts two months, or prolonging the investigation for a lengthier in-depth probe.Interested parties will be able to submit their views on the agreement until 14 June.Nationwide agreed to buy Virgin Money earlier this year in a £2.9bn all-cash agreement, in what is the largest takeover in Britain’s banking sector since the financial crisis.Shareholders in Virgin Money, including Sir Richard Branson’s Virgin Group, last week approved the deal at a shareholder vote.By contrast, some Nationwide members have complained they have been deprived of a say on the matter, with the building society refusing to give them a vote.We've launched our investigation into Nationwide Building Society's potential acquisition of Virgin Money.

Although the achievement of the grant’s performance hurdles and the substantial growth in the company’s size and profitability are fully recognized, the award value was considered outsized from the start and it has failed to accomplish certain of the board’s stated objectives from 2018.Some investors may find the board’s argument compelling, that it would be unfair for CEO Musk not to receive the award, which was previously approved by shareholders, and after achievingthe high performance hurdles. However, the concerns raised, both back in 2018 and in the interim, have not been sufficiently mitigated.07:13 AM BSTGood morningTesla is facing a spiralling investor revolt over Elon Musk’s $56bn pay deal. Elsewhere, the Treasury has sold shares in NatWest to the tune of £1.2bn, further reducing its stake, and UK house prices made a recovery in May.5 things to start your day1) Income growth under the Tories ‘worst in generations’ | Higher taxes and slower wage growth hit middle-class households hardest2) Ryanair wins victory against ‘pirate’ eDreams in battle over ticket sales | An Italian regulator has refused eDreams’ request for an injunction against Ryanair3) Burberry boss denied bonus as profits slump by 40pc | Chief executive’s total pay drops 70pc year-on-year to £1.3m4) Maker of £400 ‘dirty’ trainers worn by Taylor Swift announces £2.6bn stock market listing | Venice-headquartered Golden Goose plans to float on the Euronext market in Milan5) Electric car prices to fall further as carmakers scramble for buyers | Carmakers racing to boost sales as net zero targets loom, Auto Trader saysWhat happened overnightOn Wall Street, the S&P 500 dropped 0.6pc, to 5,235.48, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average of 30 leading US companies fell 0.9pc, to 38,111.48.

                        'LONDON (Reuters) — Tesla is working to appease some European leasing companies after the automaker’s repeated retail price cuts tanked their fleets’ value and its slow service and expensive repairs alienated their corporate customers.The efforts include unofficial discounts on purchases of new cars if they are in stock and efforts to address widespread service, repair and ordering complaints after years in which fleet managers and leasing firms say Tesla has ignored those problems, according to Reuters interviews with nine executives from major leasing and rental-car firms, along with about a dozen corporate fleet managers.Tesla’s retail price cuts aimed to bolster sales in response to softening electric-vehicle demand globally and rising competition, especially from Chinese EV makers such as BYD. But that damaged the bottom lines of its biggest customers in Europe — where fleet purchases represent nearly half of auto sales.Leasing companies buy new cars and arrange leases calculated on how much they believe they can sell them for at the end of the lease. Sudden drops in price undercut those residual values, costing leasing firms money.There’s "nothing worse" than continuously dropping the value of a fleet buyer’s assets, said Richard Knubben, director general of Brussels-based Leaseurope, a leasing- and rental-industry group which represents national groups across 31 countries."Tesla is now actively telling our members: We can give you discounts and compensate you," Knubben said. "But Tesla\'s residuals have dropped so fast, I\'m not sure the discounts they\'re offering are enough."Tesla did not respond to requests for comment.Tesla’s falling resale values and tensions with fleet customers are known, but its damage-control campaign to address them has not been previously reported.A top executive at a large European car-leasing firm, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he did not have permission to comment publicly on Tesla, said that, starting in mid-2023, Tesla offered unofficial end-of-quarter discounts on its Model 3 and Model Y by up to 2,000 euros ($2,134) for leasing-company purchases, if those vehicles were in stock.Since late last year, he said, those discounts have been available all the time.Tim Albertsen, CEO of Ayvens — Europe\'s largest auto-leasing company with a fleet of 3.4 million cars, about 10% of which are EVs — said Tesla’s service has improved but its falling resale values have been damaging. "Tesla has understood that and is coming with solutions that help us with that," he said.Albertsen declined to elaborate on what Tesla has done to mitigate Ayvens’ losses on EVs.Arval, the car-leasing unit of BNP Paribas\', is now talking to three Chinese automakers about buying EVs after taking losses tied to declining Tesla values. When Tesla first started cutting prices last year, Arval told the automaker: “You are really shooting yourself in the foot,” said Arval Deputy CEO Bart Beckers.Arval leases about 170,000 EVs as part of its 1.7 million-vehicle fleet, Becker said. He said Tesla is working to fix repair-and-service problems but added the automaker’s “new challengers” — Chinese EV makers — seem to be avoiding Tesla’s mistakes by focusing on maintaining strong resale values for cars.The automaker faces the same resale-value problem with rental-car companies. Hertz has been selling off Teslas in the U.S. market, while German rival Sixt has stopped buying them. Asked about the impact of Tesla’s price cuts, Sixt said lower residual values on EVs from Tesla and other brands reduced its 2023 earnings by 40 million euros ($42.7 million).Critical customersFleet customers are important in any automotive market but especially so in Europe, where firms often lease large numbers of company cars for employees, in part because of associated tax breaks. Leasing and rental-car company purchases comprised 44% of Tesla sales last year in the UK and 15 EU countries, according to market research firm Dataforce.Tesla’s first-quarter fleet sales in those countries fell 2.3% while the market as a whole was up 3.5%. Even as its fleet sales fell, leasing companies’ and rental car firms’ share of Tesla’s business in those markets rose to 49%.Tesla\'s sales and profits are falling globally after a long period of sharp growth. The automaker reported an 8.5% drop in global deliveries during the first quarter, its first decline in four years.The decline in fleet sales in those 16 European countries comes after 57% growth in 2023, over the previous year, according to Dataforce. Tesla posted the same percentage growth for all sales across Europe, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers Association.Until recently, Tesla had a first-mover advantage that meant European corporate customers had few alternatives for EVs to meet internal climate goals or EU emissions targets.That’s changing swiftly. Chinese automakers including BYD are bringing lower-cost electric models to Europe and aggressively courting Tesla\'s corporate customers, according to fleet managers, along with executives from leasing firms. Legacy automakers such as Volkswagen and BMW are also producing increasingly competitive EVs. ‘Pent-up frustration’ Slow and expensive Tesla service has been another sore point with European leasing companies and their customers, according to Reuters interviews with about a dozen corporate fleet managers. Most declined to be identified because they are actively seeking to resolve problems with Tesla.Its repairs take too long and cost far more than other vehicles, partly because of pricey parts, they say.Even so, Tesla does have satisfied fleet customers.Octopus Electric Vehicles, the car-leasing arm of UK energy firm Octopus Energy, has about 5,000 Teslas among about 15,000 EVs. CEO Fiona Howarth said that Tesla, as an EV pioneer, needed time to figure out service operations and that legacy automakers now face similar challenges with their own EVs. She said Tesla resale values were artificially high during the coronavirus pandemic and needed to come down."We\'ve had a really good working relationship with Tesla," she said.Lorna McAtear, fleet manager at UK energy firm National Grid, described much rockier relations with Tesla. She’s been compiling data on repair costs and found Tesla’s to be triple the industry average.Other problems, McAtear said, include a cumbersome ordering system and cars arriving with defects. For instance, she said, Tesla delivered a number of EVs with warped windshields and declined to fix them under warranty.National Grid has more than 500 Teslas in its company-car fleet of 2,000 vehicles. McAtear said she has planned to propose her company drop Tesla from its fleet unless the problems are addressed. Meanwhile, Tesla’s chief Chinese rival, BYD, is starting to deliver cars to National Grid.McAtear said she pushed for a face-to-face meeting with Tesla representatives in mid-April. During that meeting the automaker promised service improvements and an ordering-system fix, along with additional meetings and a “roadmap” for resolving outstanding problems leaving McAtear feeling like "we finally have customer service."The automaker has been unresponsive in the past, she said: "There have been years of pent-up frustration that fleets can\'t talk to Tesla."(Reporting By Nick Carey in London, Marie Mannes in Stockholm and Hyunjoo Jin in San Francisco.; Additional reporting by Christina Amann in Berlin.; Editing by Brian Thevenot and Anna Driver)',

the discounts they re offering are enough  tesla did not respond to requests for comment tesla s falling resale values and tensions with fleet customers are known  but its damage control campaign to address them has not been previously reported a top executive at a large european car leasing firm  who spoke on condition of anonymity because he did not have permission to comment publicly on tesla  said that  starting in mid 2023  tesla offered unofficial end of quarter discounts on its model 3 and model y by up to 2 000 euros   2 134  for leasing company purchases  if those vehicles were in stock since late last year  he said  those discounts have been available all the time tim albertsen  ceo of ayvens   europe s largest auto leasing company with a fleet of 3 4 million cars  about 10  of which are evs   said tesla s service has improved but its falling resale values have been damaging   tesla has understood that and is coming with solutions that help us with that   he said albertsen declined to elaborate on what tesla has done to mitigate ayvens  losses on evs arval  the car leasing unit of bnp paribas   is now talking to three chinese automakers about buying evs after taking losses tied to declining tesla values  when tesla first started cutting prices last year  arval told the automaker   you are really shooting yourself in the foot   said arval deputy ceo bart beckers arval leases about 170 000 evs as part of its 1 7 million vehicle fleet  becker said  he said tesla is working to fix repair and service problems but added the automaker s  new challengers    chinese ev makers   seem to be avoiding tesla s mistakes by focusing on maintaining strong resale values for cars the automaker faces the same resale value problem with rental car companies  hertz has been selling off teslas in the u s  market  while german rival sixt has stopped buying them  asked about the impact of tesla s price cuts  sixt said lower residual values on evs from tesla and other brands reduced its 2023 earnings by 40 million euros   42 7 million  critical customersfleet customers are important in any automotive market but especially so in europe  where firms often lease large numbers of company cars for employees  in part because of associated tax breaks  leasing and rental car company purchases comprised 44  of tesla sales last year in the uk and 15 eu countries  according to market research firm dataforce tesla s first quarter fleet sales in those countries fell 2 3  while the market as a whole was up 3 5   even as its fleet sales fell  leasing companies  and rental car firms  share of tesla s business in those markets rose to 49  tesla s sales and profits are falling globally after a long period of sharp growth  the automaker reported an 8 5  drop in global deliveries during the first quarter  its first decline in four years the decline in fleet sales in those 16 european countries comes after 57  growth in 2023  over the previous year  according to dataforce  tesla posted the same percentage growth for all sales across europe  according to the european automobile manufacturers association until recently  tesla had a first mover advantage that meant european corporate customers had few alternatives for evs to meet internal climate goals or eu emissions targets that s changing swiftly  chinese automakers including byd are bringing lower cost electric models to europe and aggressively courting tesla s corporate customers  according to fleet managers  along with executives from leasing firms  legacy automakers such as volkswagen and bmw are also producing increasingly competitive evs   pent up frustration  slow and expensive tesla service has been another sore point with european leasing companies and their customers  according to reuters interviews with about a dozen corporate fleet managers  most declined to be identified because they are actively seeking to resolve problems with tesla its repairs take too long and cost far more than other vehicles  partly because of pricey parts  they say even so  tesla does have satisfied fleet customers octopus electric vehicles  the car leasing arm of uk energy firm octopus energy  has about 5 000 teslas among about 15 000 evs  ceo fiona howarth said that tesla  as an ev pioneer  needed time to figure out service operations and that legacy automakers now face similar challenges with their own evs  she said tesla resale values were artificially high during the coronavirus pandemic and needed to come down  we ve had a really good working relationship with tesla   she said lorna mcatear  fleet manager at uk energy firm national grid  described much rockier relations with tesla  she s been compiling data on repair costs and found tesla s to be triple the industry average other problems  mcatear said  include a cumbersome ordering system and cars arriving with defects  for instance  she said  tesla delivered a number of evs with warped windshields and declined to fix them under warranty national grid has more than 500 teslas in its company car fleet of 2 000 vehicles  mcatear said she has planned to propose her company drop tesla from its fleet unless the problems are addressed  meanwhile  tesla s chief chinese rival  byd  is starting to deliver cars to national grid mcatear said she pushed for a face to face meeting with tesla representatives in mid april  during that meeting the automaker promised service improvements and an ordering system fix  along with additional meetings and a  roadmap  for resolving outstanding problems leaving mcatear feeling like  we finally have customer service  the automaker has been unresponsive in the past  she said   there have been years of pent up frustration that fleets can t talk to tesla   reporting by nick

                        "Stocks closed another week near record highs as the latest jobs report showed a US labor market that's cooling, but not at a pace that economists find concerning.The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was up about 2.3%, and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose roughly 1.3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was up about 0.3%.The week's highlights include the June Federal Reserve meeting and a key inflation reading on Wednesday. The first reading of consumer sentiment for June is also expected on Friday.In corporate news, Big Tech will kick off the week with Nvidia's (NVDA) 10-for-1 stock split and Apple's (AAPL) Worldwide Developer's Conference both set for Monday. A vote on Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package is expected on Thursday.Meanwhile, chaotic moves in GameStop stock (GME) have continued to garner investor attention as the return of Keith Gill, a popular leader of the 2021 meme stock frenzy, has reignited interest.The Fed, inflation, and the path for interest rates Friday's May jobs report showed more job additions than expected, adding fuel to a common narrative from Federal Reserve officials that the labor market remains on solid enough footing to keep interest rates at their current restrictive levels. And to economists, the latest data just emphasizes that the Fed needs to see inflation decline further before cutting rates.\"Policymakers will need to see a few slower inflation reports over the summer in order to start cutting rates by the fall,\" Wells Fargo senior economist Sarah House wrote in a research note on Friday.The next update on inflation is expected on Wednesday morning with the release of the May Consumer Price Index (CPI). Wall Street expects an annual gain of 3.4% for headline CPI, which includes the price of food and energy, unchanged from April. Prices are set to rise 0.1% on a month-over-month basis, down from 0.3% in April.On a \"core\" basis, which strips out the volatile food and energy prices, inflation is expected to have risen 3.5% year over year, a slowdown from the 3.6% increase seen in April. Monthly core price increases are expected to clock in at 0.3%, unchanged from the prior month.The release will come just hours before the Fed's latest policy decision, where markets largely expect the central bank to keep rates unchanged. This pushes the main focus to the Fed's latest Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) — including its \"dot plot,\" which maps out policymakers' expectations for where interest rates could be headed in the future — as well as commentary from Fed Chair Jerome Powell.Story continuesJPMorgan chief US economist Michael Feroli expects the Fed to project a median of two interest rate cuts this year in its dot plot, down from three in March. As far as Powell's commentary is concerned, Feroli believes Powell's presser will be perceived \"dovish.\"\"At the press conference, we expect Chair Powell will express confidence that the economy is still on the right path and that the FOMC can be patient in gaining confidence that inflation is heading toward two percent,\" Feroli wrote in a note to clients on Friday.Fewer cuts, no problemPrior to Friday's jobs report, the market was pricing in two rate cuts this year. After the release, that number teetered between one and two, per Bloomberg data.Notably, though, that shift and a 15-basis-point jump in the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) to 4.43% did little to deter investor optimism as the S&P 500 closed near a record high on Friday.New York Life Investments economist and chief market strategist Lauren Goodwin told Yahoo Finance this could be because the stronger-than-expected jobs report is good news for the economy, and \"markets have been very focused on growth.\"She added that, given the solid earnings backdrop expected for the rest of this year and a solid growth trajectory for the economy, markets can take the Fed repricing \"in stride.\"Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell listens at a meeting of the Financial Stability Oversight Council at the Treasury Department on May 10, 2024, in Washington, D.C. (Kent Nishimura/Getty Images) (Kent Nishimura via Getty Images)Apple's WWDCApple's Worldwide Developers Conference is set to kick off on Monday, with investors expecting more details to be released on the tech giant's push into generative AI.After a rocky start to the year, the stock has rallied more than 7% over the past month leading into the event and recently turned positive for the year.Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley has a full preview of the event.More Nvidia stockNvidia shares are set to begin trading on Monday on a new 10-for-1 split basis, revising the stock price from its Friday close of $1,208.88 to $120.88. The split means that owners of Nvidia common stock as of the close of market on Thursday received 10 shares for each share they held. For example, if a shareholder owned four shares of Nvidia as of Thursday, they'll now own 40 shares post-split.Typically, stock splits are viewed by investors as a sign of strength, and consequently, companies that split their stock typically outperform the S&P 500 in the year following their announcement.On average, stocks rise 25% in the 12 months following the announcement of their split compared to an average return of 12% from the S&P 500 in the same time frame, per analysis from Bank of America. This has been true \"across market regimes,\" BofA investment and ETF strategist Jared Woodard wrote in a note to clients.Notably, the trend includes the time period from 2000 to 2009, amid the unwinding of the tech bubble. Since Nvidia announced its split on May 22, shares are up about 27%.Musk's moneyTesla's annual shareholder meeting is slated for after the market close on Thursday, and the most pressing issue will be the shareholder vote on a potential $56 billion pay package for CEO Elon Musk.Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said he's advised investors to pay close attention to the vote, as it will have \"significance to the long-term strategic direction of the company.\"He added, \"While impossible to predict the outcome, we expect the event could potentially drive material volatility in TSLA shares.\"In a survey of 109 investors, Morgan Stanley found most investors feel that approving Musk's pay package would send Tesla shares higher, while a vote not to approve would weigh on the stock.

                        '(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc. workers are living in fear of the “Dear Employee” layoff email.Most Read from BloombergOver a month into Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk’s plans to slash at least 10% of the company’s workforce, he’s still not done. This means anxious employees wake up each day to check their messages, wondering if they still have a job. The rolling job cuts are likely to extend through at least June, according to people familiar with the matter, who weren’t authorized to speak publicly about the layoffs.“It’s difficult to imagine the feeling of walking on eggshells every day at work, uncertain whether or not you’ll be able to pay your bills or feed your family,” Michael Minick, a former Tesla sales representative who was laid off in April, wrote on LinkedIn. “It would be a relief to know that they can breathe and focus on their work, without the gray cloud of uncertainty looming over.”Tesla’s workforce already has endured dramatic transformation the last few years — the onetime Silicon Valley upstart with a maniacal vision on clean energy is now concentrated in Texas and fixated on other undertakings, including artificial intelligence and robots.Some still with the company say Musk has sapped morale by prioritizing a robotaxi over a $25,000 electric vehicle. They also say a mission that had inspired legions of Musk acolytes has been muddied. The tumult — some of which has been self-inflicted — has contributed to Tesla shares slumping 29% this year, costing the company $224 billion in market value. The stock fell another 1.4% shortly after the start of regular trading Monday.Musk has yet to give staff an “all clear” indication that the job cuts are over, leading co-workers to darkly joke with one another about anxiety and insomnia. One current employee described the atmosphere as akin to Squid Game, the hit television series in which characters facing financial hardship fight for their lives playing deadly children’s contests.The waves of dismissals, which already have hit thousands across departments including sales, human resources and virtually the entire Supercharger division, are expected to gut significant parts of Tesla, which started the year with more than 140,000 employees. Musk has pushed for a 20% reduction in headcount, Bloomberg reported last month.Read More: Musk’s Robotaxi Dreams Plunge Tesla Into ChaosIn the Supercharger division, some employees found out that Max de Zegher, the director of charging for North America, had been laid off after his Microsoft Teams icon suddenly went gray, indicating that he was no longer with the company.Many on the team spent the next several days saying their goodbyes, cracking jokes and making references to the Titanic, according to Joel Musial, who was laid off from his job as a Tesla construction manager. “We were just missing the string quartet!” Musial wrote on LinkedIn.The gallows humor pervaded the Supercharging team, which had set up more than 6,200 stations and 57,000 connectors worldwide and was in the process of opening the network to other automakers, which should increase usage.Musk says Tesla still plans to grow the network, albeit at a slower pace. He rehired de Zegher, but hasn’t said how many others will be asked to return.It’s also unclear whether the company will have enough personnel to sustain Supercharger stations, after layoffs hit several technician groups. A former employee in California said two dozen people were cut from an 80-person team that maintained and fixed Superchargers in Northern California, leaving gaps in both geography and specialties.The region now has just one employee in an over 200-mile stretch between Santa Rosa and Eureka, said the person, who was cut two weeks after the initial layoff announcement.Read More: Car Dealers Say Tesla Sales May Have Peaked in CaliforniaAnother person in a similar role based in Canada predicted chaos after he and dozens of others were let go, since many Tesla charging stations are hours apart, and the amount of work required will only increase once more companies’ customers get access.He said he’d worked for two weeks after the initial layoff announcement in a state of distraction and uncertainty, where an ever-growing workload and constantly disappearing co-workers made it difficult to concentrate. On his last day at Tesla, he said he was dispatching technicians and attending his daily slate of meetings, only to find himself locked out of his company laptop at 10:45 p.m. By 11:01 p.m. that night, he received the layoff notice at his personal account.The cuts are hitting at a time of sluggish demand for the broader EV industry, which is heaping pressure on a workforce already coming to grips with changes in the company’s culture, according to a former sales employee. The person said he’d already seen significant turnover in his near-decade with Tesla, and that each departure cost the carmaker crucial institutional knowledge.“Great companies are made up of equal parts great people and great products, and the latter are only possible when its people are thriving,” Rich Otto, who resigned as Tesla’s head of product launches this month, said in a LinkedIn post that he deleted after media outlets reported on it. “The recent layoffs that are rocking the company and its morale have thrown this harmony out of balance, and it’s hard to see the long game.”--With assistance from Edward Ludlow.(Updates with share performance in the fifth paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek©2024 Bloomberg L.P.',

                        "DENPASAR, Indonesia (AP) — Indonesia’s top investment official said Monday that the government has proposed to Tesla CEO Elon Musk the construction of an electric vehicle battery plant in the nickel-rich country.The official spoke after Musk met with Indonesian President Joko Widodo while attending a water conference on the island of Bali.“We made an offer, is it possible to build an EV battery factory, precursor to cathodes, here. And he said he will consider it,” Coordinating Maritime Affairs and Investment Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan, told reporters.Indonesia is keen to build up industries to exploit is rich natural resources, which include the world’s largest nickel reserves. Nickel is an important material for EV batteries and solar panels.The billionaire head of Tesla and SpaceX and owner of social platform X was visiting the Indonesian resort island to launch a Starlink satellite internet service there.He also spoke to officials and experts attending the conference on global water challenges, saying he believed that desalination could solve water shortages if enough energy was provided.Indonesia supplies 40% of the world’s nickel and has the potential to increase this to 75% by 2030, according to the government data. The government has set a goal of producing 600,000 electric vehicles by 2030, and will require EVs and related components produced in Indonesia to contain of 60% local content by 2027.The country has been trying for years to secure deals with Musk’s Tesla on battery investment and for Musk’s SpaceX to provide fast internet access for remote areas of the sprawling archipelago.Pandjaitan, a powerful cabinet minister and close ally of Widodo, said the president also asked the billionaire to invest in an AI center and for SpaceX to build a launchpad in Biak, an island in Indonesia’s easternmost Papua province.Musk did not make any formal announcements related to his investment plans in Southeast Asia’s largest economy.“Well, I think it’s likely that we will be investing,” Musk said in replying to a journalist's question about his plans for Indonesia at a news conference on Sunday after the ceremonial launch of the Starlink service alongside Indonesian government dignitaries. “But I think it’s quite likely that my company will invest in Indonesia.”Back in the United States, federal highway safety investigators are asking Tesla to explain how and why it developed a fix in a recall of more than 2 million vehicles equipped with the company’s Autopilot partially automated driving system.Investigators with the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration have concerns about whether the recall remedy worked because Tesla has reported 20 crashes since the remedy was sent out as an online software update in December.___Karmini reported from Jakarta, Indonesia",

                        'New York City Comptroller Brad Lander, who oversees five public pension funds with $242 billion in assets, has a message for the Tesla board and CEO Elon Musk: the EV maker is publicly traded, so it should stop behaving like a family-owned business with Musk at the head of the table.“I don’t know what genuinely independent board would have a CEO who is also CEO of two other large companies,” Lander told Fortune. “Every other major publicly traded company with a genuinely independent board—and many of them with not that independent of a board—expect their CEO to be a full-time CEO for their company.”Lander and a coalition of seven other investors are urging Tesla shareholders to vote down Musk’s $47 billion stock-option package at the company’s June 13 shareholder meeting. (His pay plan was originally valued at $55.8 billion but it has fluctuated with the company’s stock price performance.) The investors filed a notice this week spelling out a series of concerns about governance at the company, and what Lander called Musk’s “stratospheric” compensation.One of them is that Musk doesn’t work at Tesla full-time, said Lander, adding that there’s no doubt Musk is distracted by his other companies, which include SpaceX, The Boring Company, xAI, X, and Neuralink. He was also incredulous that the Tesla board, after being served up a rebuke about its independence by a Delaware Chancery Court judge, would again ask investors to approve a compensation plan that will pay Musk billions. Delaware judge Kathaleen McCormick in January rescinded Musk’s pay and ruled that the board, which includes Musk’s brother Kimbal and others with close personal and financial ties to Elon Musk, lacked independence in approving the comp plan and that Musk controlled the process and dictated the terms.“It takes a lot to get the Chancery Court to say that,” said Lander. “For the board to then turn around and say, ‘We’re ignoring the court and we’re moving forward with this stratospheric pay package and we’re not going to do anything about these distractions’” is beyond the pale.“I’ve never seen a board just wantonly ignore a court in this way,” he added.Tesla did not immediately respond to Fortune\'s request for comment. Tesla Chair Robyn Denholm has pushed back against the court’s ruling and said that it was “BS” that she was too close to Musk to be considered independent.In Lander’s view, what Tesla does could have implications that spill across other companies and founders who would rather keep close control of their companies while still having access to the capital markets. “This is not shareholder governance as envisioned by shareholder capitalism,” he said.Story continuesAmericans have been fortunate to have flourishing capital markets for generations because of the model of independent governance in which shareholders can invest and believe that board members will act as their independent representatives in relation to company management teams, he said.But he warned that isn’t happening at Tesla: “There’s rarely been as egregious a flaunting of independent shareholder governance as this."And while Lander and the other investors aren’t lobbying to replace Musk, the Tesla CEO is “absolutely” replaceable, said Lander. Still, he would rather see the board negotiate an “appropriate compensation package” with Musk and for Musk to provide the level of attention and focus on Tesla that the job requires.“He is no doubt qualified to be the Tesla CEO, but CEO succession at publicly traded companies of this scale happens all the time,” said Lander. “There are other CEOs who could do it if this CEO isn’t going to give it his full-time attention and adopt a lucrative but at least vaguely reasonable compensation package.”This story was originally featured on Fortune.com',

                        "There is no hotter subject in the technology realm than artificial intelligence (AI) right now. Indeed, the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks generally garner the most attention from Wall Street analysts and the investment community, given their groundbreaking developments across all aspects of the AI landscape.During a November 2023 interview, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood proclaimed that Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) was the largest AI opportunity in the world.Now, you might be thinking: How can a car company possibly be an AI play?The answer revolves around the moves Tesla is making in addition to its electric vehicle (EV) business. And guess what? Wood isn't the only one taking note.Famed venture capital investor Brad Gerstner increased his Altimeter Capital Management's stake in Tesla by a staggering 276% in the first quarter, bringing its holdings to 589,700 shares. Just days ago, during an interview on CNBC, Gerstner stated that Tesla has achieved a \"ChatGPT moment.\" Those are strong words.Let's explore what makes Tesla such a compelling part of the AI narrative and assess if shares are worth a buy right now. Gerstner's rich, but that doesn't mean investors should follow his moves without thinking.Tesla is a car company, right?You would not be incorrect if you labeled Tesla as a car company. After all, its EVs are the biggest revenue and profit driver of the company.However, as is the case with many innovative companies, Tesla could be viewed as much more than a producer of automobiles. In fact, both Wood and Tesla CEO Elon Musk see the company as an AI or robotics company.The reason for this more tech-oriented vision of Tesla can be broken down into two categories: autonomous driving and humanoid robots.Although Tesla is very much an EV manufacturer, the company is making hefty investments in data collection and storage in order to develop software that can train Tesla cars to drive themselves without any human assistance.Moreover, as Musk and his team work relentlessly to build Tesla into the largest EV business in the world, the entrepreneur believes that humanoid robotics will play an integral role in the company's next chapter.Image source: Getty Images.How can AI positively impact Tesla?Tesla's humanoid robots are called Optimus and they are meant to be integrated into Tesla's factories. In essence, the Tesla Bots would be able to work alongside human workers and be \"capable of performing unsafe, repetitive or boring tasks.\"The implications of this should not be overlooked. Through the power of generative AI, Optimus can become smarter over time and thereby learn to complete more sophisticated tasks.Story continuesFor Tesla, in particular, there are two primary ways to benefit from Optimus. First, considering robots can theoretically work more hours than humans, the exponential labor and productivity gains that can be achieved from humanoid bots could be massive. The idea is that Optimus will speed up the production of EVs, therefore accelerating Tesla's car sales.The more lucrative opportunity with Optimus is that Tesla could sell these robots to other businesses that are heavily reliant on human labor.Regarding autonomous driving, Tesla has a number of interesting projects in the works. For starters, Musk traveled to China a few weeks ago in hopes of making progress on the company's self-driving efforts in the region. This is important because China is a major market for Tesla.Similar to Optimus, autonomous driving carries some potentially lucrative tailwinds for Tesla. As it is a software product, self-driving technology will carry higher margins compared to Tesla's EVs. Moreover, the autonomous driving feature is a subscription service, making it a recurring source of revenue.If everything works out, this one-two punch should help accelerate Tesla's top line while simultaneously generating meaningful margin expansion. As a result, Tesla is looking at a massive opportunity to bolster its cash flow, which the company could use to reinvest in the business.Is Tesla stock a good buy right now?So far, in 2024, Tesla's shares have cratered 28%.Investors engaged in some heavy selling activity earlier this year following Tesla's horrific fourth-quarter earnings report. While shares rebounded a bit after the company demonstrated some improvements during its first-quarter earnings report a few weeks ago, many investors still seem to view the stock as risky.During Gerstner's recent interview on CNBC, he said that he sees Tesla's advancements in AI as \"deeply underappreciated.\" I think this is a perfect summation of what's going on.On one side of the equation, Musk is moving at warp speed to push Tesla's evolution from a car business to an undeniable AI leader. On the other hand, the company doesn't have a lot to show for these investments just yet.Make no mistake about it, an investment in Tesla should not be rooted in a bullish outlook on EVs and green energy alone. Investors considering scooping up shares should be aligned with Musk's vision as it pertains to robotics, autonomous driving, and AI.Given how much the stock price has dropped, I think buying shares right now is a good idea. However, investors will need to exercise patience and a long-term time horizon. While I am encouraged by Tesla's AI developments, I also think the company is years away from achieving exponential gains from these innovations.Nevertheless, buying shares and holding them for the long run could prove to be a lucrative decision for growth investors.Where to invest $1,000 right nowWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

                        'there is no hotter subject in the technology realm than artificial intelligence  ai  right now  indeed  the  magnificent seven  stocks generally garner the most attention from wall street analysts and the investment community  given their groundbreaking developments across all aspects of the ai landscape during a november 2023 interview  ark invest ceo cathie wood proclaimed that tesla  nasdaq  tsla  was the largest ai opportunity in the world now  you might be thinking  how can a car company possibly be an ai play the answer revolves around the moves tesla is making in addition to its electric vehicle  ev  business  and guess what  wood isn t the only one taking note famed venture capital investor brad gerstner increased his altimeter capital management s stake in tesla by a staggering 276  in the first quarter  bringing its holdings to 589 700 shares  just days ago  during an interview on cnbc  gerstner stated that tesla has achieved a  chatgpt moment   those are strong words let s explore what makes tesla such a compelling part of the ai narrative and assess if shares are worth a buy right now  gerstner s rich  but that doesn t mean investors should follow his moves without thinking tesla is a car company  right you would not be incorrect if you labeled tesla as a car company  after all  its evs are the biggest revenue and profit driver of the company however  as is the case with many innovative companies  tesla could be viewed as much more than a producer of automobiles  in fact  both wood and tesla ceo elon musk see the company as an ai or robotics company the reason for this more tech oriented vision of tesla can be broken down into two categories  autonomous driving and humanoid robots although tesla is very much an ev manufacturer  the company is making hefty investments in data collection and storage in order to develop software that can train tesla cars to drive themselves without any human assistance moreover  as musk and his team work relentlessly to build tesla into the largest ev business in the world  the entrepreneur believes that humanoid robotics will play an integral role in the company s next chapter image source  getty images how can ai positively impact tesla tesla s humanoid robots are called optimus and they are meant to be integrated into tesla s factories  in essence  the tesla bots would be able to work alongside human workers and be  capable of performing unsafe  repetitive or boring tasks  the implications of this should not be overlooked  through the power of generative ai  optimus can become smarter over time and thereby learn to complete more sophisticated tasks story continuesfor tesla  in particular  there are two primary ways to benefit from optimus  first  considering robots can theoretically work more hours than humans  the exponential labor and productivity gains that can be achieved from humanoid bots could be massive  the idea is that optimus will speed up the production of evs  therefore accelerating tesla s car sales the more lucrative opportunity with optimus is that tesla could sell these robots to other businesses that are heavily reliant

                        'Lydia Wu had never driven an electric vehicle before she rented a car from Avis last February. An electric Genesis GV60 was all they had available at a location in Kansas City, Kansas. Wu received no specific instructions on how to use the vehicle, or how to find chargers, but she appreciated the SUV’s ornate and elegant interior.“If it was a gas vehicle, I would totally consider it as my next car,” she said. But she is out of the market for an EV.I, on the other hand, have had a lot of experience with EVs. So when I recently rented a Polestar 2 from Hertz in San Diego and received no instructions it was no problem. But I could imagine a first-time EV driver wondering, “How do I turn this thing on?” Many would be flummoxed by a car with no “Start” button, for instance. In a Polestar, you get in and it’s on. You get out and it turns off. A lot of drivers may be baffled by that alone.While sales growth has slowed, EVs make up about 7% of overall car sales, according to Cox Automotive. Rental car companies may have overestimated their customers’ readiness for a switch, though. Hertz made a bold move in 2021, saying it would order 65,000 EVs from Polestar, 100,000 from Tesla and another 175,000 from General Motors. At the time, Hertz said that EVs might represent 25% of its fleet by 2024.But in January Hertz said it would sell 20,000 Tesla models, or one-third of its fleet, to buy gas-powered cars.The company’s CEO at the time, Stephen Scherr, said, “Collision and damage repairs on an EV can often run about twice that associated with a comparable combustion engine vehicle.”Scant driver’s edIn general, big rental car companies, with huge fleets to manage and lots of customers to put into cars, don’t have time to give individual instruction to rookie EV drivers.And it’s not a seamless transition from a gas-powered vehicle to an EV. Experienced as I am, I was still taken by surprise as I approached a stop light in the Polestar and the car slowed abruptly as soon as I lifted off the accelerator. Oh, right…it’s called “automatic regenerative braking.” The Polestar was using its electric motor to slow the car while sending power back to the battery. That’s a good thing, but, again, I could just imagine a new renter panicking and thinking, “Is something wrong?”Hertz said in an email that it provides a QR code that links to a website with information about how to charge and even how to drive individual models like the Polestar 2. If that link was provided during my rental, then I must have missed it. I went to the website and watched the videos and, yes, the instructions would have been helpful. But, let’s face it, how many people who rent cars take the time to read the paperwork, let alone go to a website to review instructions?Story continuesFord 2021 Mustang Mach-E/ - FordBeyond that, both Hertz and Avis declined to comment for this story.Doug Jensen, similarly to Wu, found due to scarcity that he had to rent an EV from a Hertz location in New York City. Given no instruction on how to handle charging, he found himself trying to use Tesla chargers for his Kia rental car, not initially realizing they wouldn’t work. Then he had to struggle with a non-working EV charger at his hotel.Since then, Hertz has respected Jensen’s request to never have an EV again, he said. Hertz also gave him a free rental day and extra loyalty points to make up for his aggravation.Charging as a sticky pointIt was around around 1 a.m. in February in Kansas City, Kansas, when Wu got her rental GV60 with its batteries charged up to 57%. She had to quickly find a charger since it was cold and, with the heat running, the battery was draining faster than normal.“It was easy to find chargers but the thing is (the navigation software was) pulling up every single charger available including Tesla Superchargers,” she said. “I didn’t have EV experience so I had no idea if Tesla Superchargers were going to work with my car.”Wu was ultimately able to find a charger. She said her experience with the EV was good after it had been plugged in.“I could monitor how my car was doing, charge-wise, from my phone, even though it was in the parking lot a few blocks away. So everything was super great,” she said.There are car rental companies that offer customers more hand-holding. In my case, I’ve rented EVs from Turo, a peer-to-peer car rental platform that’s sort of like Airbnb but for cars. Just like with Airbnb, some people have set up small businesses renting their vehicles through Turo and some of them specialize in EVs.When I’ve rented EVs through Turo, a host has always given me a helpful walk-through of the vehicle. The hosts would explain the features, something that was especially helpful when I rented a Tesla Cybertruck, an EV that has plenty of quirks. The Cybertruck had cost more than a $1,000 a day to rent at the time including insurance — it had just come out — but EV rental costs are normally more in line with gas cars.Customer service as keyJoulez, an EV rental company, rents its fleet through its own website as well as through Turo. Founder Micah Bergdale said he had rented EVs years ago and saw an opportunity to do it better so he started the company in 2021.“The entire experience that someone has, especially if they’re not familiar with it, is very different than a traditional gas car,” he said.On the Joulez website, customers are asked if they have ever driven an EV and if they have any experience with the specific model they’re about to rent. If not, an on-site attendant can provide an overview. Also, Joulez has a customer service line if they have issues with things like charging.Of course, a company like Joulez can provide that kind of attention because it only has locations in four US cities and its fleet consists of about 150 vehicles. Bigger rental companies, on the other hand, manage hundreds of thousands of cars in locations nationwide.And, of course, Joulez and Turo have the advantage of a customer base that knows up front what they’re renting. Their customers select specific vehicles, unlike customers who rent from big rental companies where they might select a general class of vehicle but not find out the make and model until they arrive at the lot.But not everyone has such a bad time when renting an EV from a big rental car company. Jay Waldron, a Georgia resident, rented a Hyundai Kona EV from National while on a trip to Washington, DC. He loved how fun it was to drive.“It was so disappointing going back to my old stick-shift 4 cylinder,” he said in a text message. “Sitting in traffic with it, I missed that EV bad.”A few weeks later, Waldron bought himself a Kia EV6.For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com',

wu was ultimately able to find a charger  she said her experience with the ev was good after it had been plugged in  i could monitor how my car was doing  charge wise  from my phone  even though it was in the parking lot a few blocks away  so everything was super great   she said there are car rental companies that offer customers more hand holding  in my case  i ve rented evs from turo  a peer to peer car rental platform that s sort of like airbnb but for cars  just like with airbnb  some people have set up small businesses renting their vehicles through turo and some of them specialize in evs when i ve rented evs through turo  a host has always given me a helpful walk through of the vehicle  the hosts would explain the features  something that was especially helpful when i rented a tesla cybertruck  an ev that has plenty of quirks  the cybertruck had cost more than a  1 000 a day to rent at the time including insurance   it had just come out   but ev rental costs are normally more in line with gas cars customer service as keyjoulez  an ev rental company  rents its fleet through its own website as well as through turo  founder micah bergdale said he had rented evs years ago and saw an opportunity to do it better so he started the company in 2021  the entire experience that someone has  especially if they re not familiar with it  is very different than a traditional gas car   he said on the joulez website  customers are asked if they have ever driven an ev and if they have any experience with the specific model they re about to rent  if not  an on site attendant can provide an overview  also  joulez has a customer service line if they have issues with things like charging of course  a company like joulez can provide that kind of attention because it only has locations in four us cities and its fleet consists of about 150 vehicles  bigger rental companies  on the other hand  manage hundreds of thousands of cars in locations nationwide and  of course  joulez and turo have the advantage of a customer base that knows up front what they re renting  their customers select specific vehicles  unlike customers who rent from big rental companies where they might select a general class of vehicle but not find out the make and model until they arrive at the lot but not everyone has such a bad time when renting an ev from a big rental car company  jay waldron  a georgia resident  rented a hyundai kona ev from national while on a trip to washington  dc  he loved how fun it was to drive  it was so disappointing going back to my old stick shift 4 cylinder   he said in a text message   sitting in traffic with it  i missed that ev bad  a few weeks later  waldron bought himself a kia ev6 for more cnn news and newsletters create an account at cnn

                        "Tesla boss Elon Musk is now 'polarising as Kanye West', one Tesla shareholder has said - REUTERS/David SwansonRichard Tornetta is an unlikely campaigner against one of the world’s richest men.Until recently, the Pennsylvania resident’s biggest claim to fame was drumming in Dawn of Correction, a now-defunct thrash metal band that described its sound as “a swift kick to the face with a steel-toed work boot”.Tornetta owned just nine shares of Tesla when he sued the electric car maker six years ago, claiming a $56bn (£44bn) pay scheme awarded to the company’s chief executive Elon Musk was excessive. But when the verdict was finally announced, it delivered its own steel-toed kick to Mr Musk’s wealth.Delivering a ruling in January, Delaware judge Kathaleen McCormick described the compensation scheme as “unfathomable” and ruled that it should be reversed, saying Tesla’s board had acted like “supine servants of an overweening master”.Tornetta has remained silent, but his lawyer called the decision a “good day for the good guys”.Musk’s compensation scheme, announced in 2018, is the biggest pay package in history.To pay out, it required Tesla to hit a series of what then seemed like outlandish targets, including a tenfold increase in its valuation to $650bn and a leap in sales that was viewed as ludicrous within the scheme’s 10-year timeframe.In fact, Musk hit all the goals within four years, helping to catapult him into the upper echelons of the world’s richest people.The court’s intervention, however, threatens that status.Musk and Tesla’s board has now embarked on a quest to save history’s most lucrative payday.Shortly after the court decision, Musk announced that he would transfer Tesla’s legal incorporation from Delaware to Texas in a move could revive his $56bn deal. But to do that, he needs the blessing of investors in the world’s most valuable car maker.Next month Tesla shareholders will vote on whether to re-approve Musk’s pay package and whether to endorse the move to Texas.The first vote would not immediately restore Musk’s pay award but would be used as ammunition to overturn the Delaware court; the second would take the company out of the court’s jurisdiction.In another time, the vote might have been a foregone conclusion. In 2018 Musk’s payday was endorsed by 73pc of voting shareholders, even though Musk himself could not vote. But today, Tesla is in a rut and questions have been raised about its mercurial chief.Shares in the company have fallen by 30pc this year and last month the company reported its biggest drop in sales in more than a decade.Musk’s myriad other interests – running Twitter, starting an artificial intelligence company and his increasingly political statements – have raised concerns about his focus.Story continuesWhat is more, the vote on moving to Texas requires active approval from 50pc of shareholders, meaning that those who abstain are counted as ‘no’ votes. This is a major ask for a company that has a wide retail shareholder base not accustomed to activism.Last week, the investing website eToro said 24pc of Tesla shareholders on its platform had voted with three weeks to go until the meeting.Robyn Denholm, Tesla’s chairman, has compared the task of winning approval to climbing Mount Everest. In recent weeks she has embarked on a roadshow to encourage institutional shareholders such as Vanguard, State Street and BlackRock to support the proposals.That too may be an uphill battle. Vanguard, the biggest Tesla shareholder besides Musk with a 7.3pc stake, voted against the pay package last time.Baillie Gifford, the Scottish fund manager, supported the scheme in 2018 when it was the company’s second-biggest shareholder and has vowed to back the deal again. However, it has significantly sold down its Tesla stake since the last vote.Last week a set of shareholders including the British union Unison, wealth manager Nordea and New York City public pension funds urged other investors to vote against the proposals. They said that Mr Musk was distracted, writing: “The board has yet to ensure that Tesla has a full-time CEO.”Ross Gerber, an outspoken longtime Tesla shareholder, says he expects Musk’s gambit to fail. “I’d be pretty impressed if this passes. I think no human would believe that this was a fairly negotiated pay package.”Gerber says Musk has become too divisive. “He is now as polarising as Kanye West or Donald Trump. And so when you’re selling any product, your CEO being a polarising figure is not helpful.”However, Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, predicts that Musk will be victorious. “There have been many headwinds for the Tesla story and on June 13 this should be put in the rear view mirror,” he says.Musk is seeking 25pc voting control over Tesla, compared to today’s 13pc stake. That would set him up for a new clash with investors for whom he could once do no wrong.Defeat could have consequences: the billionaire has said that if he can’t have greater control, he may develop new technologies such as AI and robotics outside of the company.As the vote draws nearer, it is more than just Musk’s historic pay deal that is at stake.",

                        "Since going public in 2021, Rivian (NASDAQ: RIVN) has worked hard to become a household name. It's not quite there, but it is gaining recognition. The company recently received a J.D. Power award for most satisfying ownership experience. And Consumer Reports just named it one of the most beloved car brands, with 86% of owners saying they'd buy a Rivian again.The increased hype is driving impressive sales growth. Revenue is up 868% since the company's initial public offering. Is it too late to invest in this emerging growth stock? You might be surprised at the answer.2 reasons it's not too late to buy Rivian stockAcross dozens of metrics, Rivian stock was a better buy a few years ago than it is today. Sales are growing at a good clip, manufacturing facilities expanded, margins are improving, and new models are being announced. Company executives forecast that Rivian could achieve a positive gross profit sometime this year, something it has never done in the past.And yet, you couldn't tell that any of these milestones were achieved if you only followed the stock price. Since going public, Rivian stock has lost an astounding 89% of its value. How do you square this circle? There are two factors to consider.First, Rivian went public in 2021. That year, investor interest in renewable energy stocks was soaring, fueled in part by the massive Inflation Reduction Act that directed hundreds of billions of dollars in new spending to low-carbon technologies. Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) stock, for instance, surpassed $360 per share in 2021. Today, Tesla's share price is below $175, demonstrating that it wasn't just Rivian caught up in the hype.This is perhaps the biggest reason it's not too late to buy Rivian stock -- shares were previously way overpriced in a market that was overpricing nearly every stock related to a low-carbon future.RIVN Total Return Level ChartThe second reason it's not too late to buy Rivian stock is that its biggest days of growth may still be ahead of it. That's great news for prospective investors considering the valuation. In 2021 -- the year shares went public -- Rivian stock traded at roughly 60 times sales. Today, the stock is valued at just 2 times sales. That reduction is the result of both skyrocketing sales and the massive drop in share price.Why might Rivian's best days still be ahead of it? The first thing to note is that its sales base is still quite small, even if it has grown significantly in recent years. Over the past 12 months, the company generated around $5 billion in sales. Tesla, for comparison, brought in nearly $100 billion over the past year. Rivian's growth since it went public heavily outpaced Tesla's initial years of growth. And if Tesla is any indication, the company could someday reach the $100 billion sales mark -- roughly 20 times what the company pulls in today.Story continuesRivian is currently putting the pieces in place to greatly expand its sales base over the long term. It recently unveiled its R2, R3, and R3X models, received $827 million in state funding to expand its manufacturing facilities in Illinois, and is expected to directly benefit from major new tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles. It will take years for these developments to be fully realized, but the company has a clear path forward to catching up with Tesla.RIVN Revenue (TTM) ChartShould you buy Rivian stock right now?Now that Rivian stock has come way down in price, is the stock right for your portfolio? That depends on two things: your risk tolerance and patience. As a capital-intensive, early-stage growth company, Rivian is losing a lot of money right now. Last quarter, it lost $38,784 for every vehicle it sold! But customer satisfaction and loyalty are high, and with greater scale and the introduction of new, lower-priced models, management believes margins will continue to improve dramatically. Still, this will take years, and the company is currently focused on reducing cash burn so that it can survive long enough to realize this future.Will Rivian survive long enough to scale its business to Tesla proportions? It's very possible. The company has proven its ability to execute, and it has a committed base of shareholders with deep pockets. Amazon, for example, is one of Rivian's largest shareholders, owning more than 158 million shares. But there's no doubt that it will take many years before Rivian's fate is ultimately determined. However, it should be noted that Tesla's stock also languished for years before becoming the giant it is today. Rivian may follow the same trajectory, but investors should only jump in if they're willing to remain patient, holding through some strong volatility along the way.Should you invest $1,000 in Rivian Automotive right now?Before you buy stock in Rivian Automotive, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Rivian Automotive wasn’t one of them.

                        "After an eventful week compounded by Nvidia's (NVDA) fiscal first-quarter earnings, the major market averages (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) are hoping to end the week on a high note and claw back some gains ahead of the Memorial Day Weekend.Morning Brief Hosts Seana Smith and Brad Smith walk investors through the top stories moving stocks in Friday's trading day, kicking off the session with Truist Co-Chief Investment Officer and Chief Market Strategist Keith Lerner who compares the market sway of Nvidia's latest earnings to that of inflation data or the Federal Reserve's monetary policy.The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved ether ETF offerings on Thursday, leading Bloomberg Intelligence ETF Research Analyst James Seyffart to believe ethereum-exposed (ETH-USD) products will have similar success to the spot bitcoin ETFs (BTC-USD) rolled out at the start of 2024, just not on the same scale.Other top trending stories include the latest in the Department of Justice's (DOJ) antitrust suit against concert promoter and ticket seller Live Nation (LYV) and Charter Communications' (CHTR) content distribution deal with Paramount Global (PARA).This post was written by Luke Carberry Mogan.Video Transcript9 a.m. here in New York City.I'm John Smith alongside Brad Smith and this is Yahoo Finance is like to show the morning brief was that features are moving to the upside here this morning recovering some of the losses on the worst session that we saw more than a year for the day that the do on these to drop about 2.5% for the week.And we're looking at two mag seven members this morning in video and Tesla video poised to hit a fresh record high and this comes as Reuters reports, Nvidia's oversupply of its A I chips prompted the company to cut prices in China.Meanwhile, Tesla reportedly slashing production at its Shanghai plan for its model.Why vehicle we dive into those stories this hour?Let's get right to it with the three things that you know on this Friday morning, your road map of the trading day as we've got Yahoo Finances, Jennifer Schomberg and Anne for standing by with more stock futures moving higher this morning as the dow looks to recover from its worst session since March 2023.1 year ago.Stocks have been feeling the pressure.This week after the fed minutes reignited concerns over the path of interest rates and with progress stalling on inflation, Goldman Sachs is pushing back on the timing for a potential rate cut from July to September.The SEC approved a rule change late Thursday that paves the way for a spot of the ETF approval.Story continuesThe next step, regulators will need to give fund managers approval before they can launch ETF products.So the timing of that remains unclear and we're on full Elon Musk watch this morning.The giant Tesla reportedly slashing production at its Shanghai plan for its model.Why vehicle this coming amid concerns of wing demand in the electric vehicle market and must pushes back on a report of discussions over selling existing shares of Space X at an undisclosed price that could value the company at $200 billion.Well, good morning everyone and a happy pre holiday weekend to you.We're taking a look at some pre market moves ahead of this long holiday weekend, Thursday choppy session for stocks, Boeing, dragging the Dow to its worst session since March of 2023.The NVIDIA bump also be called being called into question.As strong economic data reinforces the good news is bad news narrative here.So focusing in on some of the future's activity here this morning, you are seeing just a little bit of a move higher for the dow futures by about 2/10 of a percent.And then additionally, attempting a little bit of a rebound from yesterday S and P 500 the NASDAQ 100 also in positive territory right now, this is going to be really interesting to watch because like you said yesterday, a lot of that movement to the downside, the worst day that we've seen for the Dow in over a year that was attributable to that massive decline that we saw in Boeing yesterday falling just around 7%.I believe.So.Again, a close, it's important to keep a close eye on that name.When we talk about some of that movement, they falling just about 7.5% yesterday.Today, you can see this morning up just about 6/10 of a percent ahead of the open.But we will see whether or not we will see a bounce back in some of those uh dow components here today.And then also another big story that's going on in the market.It's going to be critical here in today's session is the movement that we're seeing a lot of these larger cab names, especially what we're seeing play out in the tech sector because like you can see on your screen, there was certainly a lot of red across the board yesterday, NVIDIA, actually the only mag seven name to close out the day with gains and you're looking at a pop of just about 9%.So NVIDIA wasn't enough for the broader market, but it was enough for investors to still find reason to buy that name on the heels of earnings.You gotta imagine a lot of the talk around the grill this weekend is gonna be around NVIDIA, the stock split and the absolutely massive run that we've seen over the course of this year for if you need a fast fact to toss out there to folks and try to impress some of your friends and family.Just remember up over 100% year to date for NVIDIA.All right.Well, the raids debate surges on and the higher for longer narrative isn't going away just yet.Atlanta Fed President Rafael Bostick noting that progress on inflation is still slow even if it has resumed falling.Now, Goldman Sachs economist also weighing in on race, Jared B licky has the details on that.Jared.That's right.Roth Bostic is the latest of a plethora of Fed speakers this week to come out saying that the fed may have to keep rates higher for longer.That doesn't sound like anything new, but there are some new details here because the FED is in danger of being on the wrong side of inflation once again with uh everybody remembers the transitory episode from a few years ago as far as interest rates.Bostic is suggesting the Federal Reserve may need to delay cutting rates uh potentially keeping the current rate which is five and a quarter to 5.5% longer than expected because the US has not passed that critical point at which inflation we can say is in the rearview mirror.And yesterday, it was only yesterday that we got the composite PMI S. Those are purchasing purchasing manager manager index surveys.Those came out at the highest level since April of 2022.That's important for a number of reasons.This is a small report that doesn't usually move the market, but it suggests according to S and P, what's what's interesting?And this is a quote from S and P. What's interesting is that the main inflationary impetus is now coming from manufacturing rather than services.So getting back to Botek, another thing that he said was interest that I thought was interesting was the FED is going to conduct a new framework review of its inflation target in 2025.That's next year.Currently, that target is 2% but the FED has been making the case very slowly that maybe just maybe that needs to rise guys.All right, Jared.Thanks so much.Well, again, taking a look at the major averages here, you have futures moving to the upside.It's looking to regain some of that momentum that it lost yesterday.The dow coming off its worst day of the year now, the move lower yesterday coming despite the fact that NVIDIA once again posting another record breaking earnings report, it was not enough though to keep that market rally intact.So here to break it all down and where we could see maybe pockets of strength going forward.We want to bring in Keith Lerner.He's truest, co chief investment officer and Chief Market Strategist Keith.It's great to see you.So talk to me about how you're looking at some of the losses that we saw yesterday and whether or not the narrative surrounding NVIDIA and some of that excitement has faded just a bit when we talk about the broader market action.Yeah.Well, first, uh Shawna and Brad always great to be with you, especially out of this long weekend.I hope you guys get some downtime as well.Um So, you know, our view is this, first of all, we, we, we did upgrade um equities in late April um when we were down about 5% because we thought the risk reward had improved.Now, we moved up 7% expectations into that NVIDIA print was really high and it almost seemed like the anticipation of this report felt like AC P I Employment Day.And if you know, you have been doing this for a long time that on those days, regardless of the number, the market often acts differently than you would expect.And I think that's the case yesterday, but I also think what's kind of happening now is that we're moving past earnings season, one of the most steady things in our work has been forward earning estimates.Have been moving higher.But now that you move past earnings season, the market hasn't now start focusing again on what is the fed gonna do and inflation and each economic data.So that just makes for a more volatile market.Our underlying message is we still think the primary trend is higher.I think their term, the market will be searching for a catalyst, which likely means that we're in more of a choppy period after that 7% rip up.But again, we think the primary trend is still one that is positive.Who do you think is that next catalyst that could emerge?Keith?Well, I I think, um you know, first of all, I'm gonna go through the summer months.So it's, I mean, even just kind of going through back and forth um is, is actually, I think fine, I think the catalyst for the market um is, is probably to start seeing more disinflationary pressures which as as Sharon just mentioned, we got almost the, the opposite of that yesterday.So for the market to actually move high in a meaningful way, we likely need rates to actually break below this 430 level in the 10 year Treasury and the market get more comfortable.But that, that there's more this inflationary pressures that will allow the fed later this year to at least cut, you know, once or or twice.I don't think it matters if it's June or September.I think the main most important thing for the market is that it's more likely that they cut if the message really starts to change, that they have to raise rates, which is not our base case.I think that would be the biggest concern for the overall overall market.Keith, are you seeing any signs of exuberance in the market at this point?When you take a look at valuations and where we are today?Well, so I think there, there's some signs in the last week or so.I mean, we saw some signs as far as the meme stocks, we saw some strategists on the street really just lift their targets, you know, pretty meaningfully in a short period of time.If you look at the options market, there's almost no demand for, for downside protection.Um So I think that's more of a, a shorter term.I don't think it's, you know, exuberance.I just think that it's one of those things where you, where when you have those type of things happen, it's not unusual to have a little bit of, of a, of a gut check or gut check in the overall market.And that's what I think we're, we're having and I also think, listen, when we get back from Memorial Day, you get into June, you're gonna seeing the presidential election.Um And I think people are gonna start focusing on that.That's gonna add another dynamic as far as just this kind of more of a two way trade even within that uptrend that we still think is intact when there are those pockets of volatility heath, where are some of the top dip buying opportunities emerging from your purview?Well, I, you know, I actually still think um that, that, that tech and communications is still leadership.In fact, uh yesterday, one thing we look at is relative price, momentum and relative trends um of each sector to the overall market.And what we did yesterday at the NVIDIA print, which makes sense is we broke out to an all time high after consolidating.So what that tells us is tech remains leadership.We've been overweight that reaffirms our overweight.The other thing that we look at is the earnings momentum for the overall sector is still much stronger than the overall market.When that happens, historically, tech remains leadership.And I will say, you know, if you look into the, the, the surface, you know, while the S and P broke out to new highs and we're still positive below the surface, we didn't see the follow through from mid caps or small caps or some of these interest rate sensitive areas.So we would really be fo focused more on that large cap space and, and really still like tech and communications as two of our favorite sectors, you know, uh Keith, as we look out to next week, we're also gonna get one more big earnings report here coming in the form of sales force.Now, NVIDIA has also been called, they've already been dubbed the, the de facto A I play by Goldman, but is, is sales force almost brewing as maybe AAA de facto junior as it relates to some of the software services side of this business and the, and the elements that can immediately kind of be tangibly touched within workplaces.Yeah, I, I think, I think that's, that's fair.I mean, I think, I think the sales force, you think about it oracle, what you wanna see is, is the A I benefit accruing beyond, you know, one big company, right?And, and I think that from from market perspective, you, you do want to see it, it boiling out to be a be beyond that.And if you had something that was really weak there, then again, I think on a short period, tech is the biggest sector that could weigh on things.But overall, I still think if you kind of zoom out a bit, you know, our perspective on artificial intelligence.Um and also the earning trends, I think as far as you know, the spend on that is we're still pretty early cycle even if the economy slows down, even if there's all these uncertainty, I think companies will have to continue to invest in A I and tech otherwise they're gonna be left behind.So I think there is a tail and bigger picture.But as you mentioned, I think in a week next week as we winding down earnings, that will be an important report.Yeah, even as I'm sitting here previewing sales forces earnings and calling them de facto junior for a, I imagine, uh, the meta platforms and Microsoft or somewhere saying hold my beer.We've got a lot that we're doing in this area too.Keith Lerner.Great to see you.Thanks so much for taking the time.Great to be with you.Take care.Absolutely.The sec approving a rule change paving the way for spot Ethereum ETF approval.The next step, fund managers need approval from the agency before they can launch ETF products.Now, the timeline on that it's still unclear.So for more on this, we've got the person to bring us some clarity on this.Yahoo finance reporter Jennifer Schonberger here with us.Hey Jennifer, good morning, Brad.That's right.The SEC giving a green light to the New York Stock Exchange and the NASDAQ to begin listing exchange traded funds that hold either but it has yet to give approval to money managers that want to issue these new funds.The move marks the first step towards allowing these ETF to trade.The SEC would need to offer approval though, for the money managers filings for those actual funds to begin trading, though the regulator has not given any indication of when that could happen.The cohort seeking approval for these Ether ETF s include some of Wall Street's biggest names from Black Rock Fidelity and Franklin Templeton to a number of firms better known in the crypto world including gray scale and bit wise.This decision coming roughly four months after the SEC approved Spot Bitcoin ETF for the first time after years of denying approval, Sec chair, Gary Ginzler, speaking at a conference here in Washington early on Thursday morning ahead of the order said that the SEC is very deeply committed to following the law and how courts interpret the law that the SEC had picked up formally on what the previous SEC chair uh Clayton was doing in this field around exchange traded products.But after he says two dozen orders from the commission, the ruling from the DC Circuit Court of Appeals took a different view and the SEC has now taken that into consideration and pivoted.Hence why we're seeing the groundwork here laid for an E spot ETF.Of course, the race is on in terms of speculating for when we could see approval for those actual money managers, we will be keeping an eye on that.E has been pretty volatile on the back of this down.About I think 4% last day check still.It was trading around 3700 guys, Jennifer, thanks so much for teeing up this next conversation.For more on the Ether ETF news we bring in James Seaford who is the Bloomberg Intelligence ETF research analyst.Great to have you here with us and Thanks for hopping on this morning.I mean, how significant is this for Ethereum?And how many of the other, perhaps alt coins out there could be watching this and saying we, we, we got a shot maybe.Yeah.Thanks for having me, Brad.Um, I, I don't think the other ones have that much of a shot in the near term.Um, look, the Bitcoin ETF got approved because we have a regulated, a federally regulated CME Bitcoin futures market.And basically the SEC said we're not going to approve anything unless we have a market that we can surveil.Um, and that we can make sure there's no fraud and manipulation going on.So that was basically what the DC Circuit court that she was just talking about allowed for the Bitcoin ETF to get approval.Ethereum is the only other digital app that has a federally regulated futures market that trades with enough size and enough frequency that theoretically the SEC could look for some sort of fraud and manipulation that doesn't really exist anywhere else that said things are moving very fast.The political winds have shifted.I mean, over just about a week ago, we didn't think this was going to happen, but everything really changed.On Monday, there was a complete 180 as far as we're concerned from DC.And the SEC on this topic, we think that they were likely going to deny these things until sometime late last week.James.What do you think one, what changed?And two, what do you think demand is going to look like then for these potential, uh, spot, uh E three ETF s?Yeah, I mean, what changed is political wind shifted?I mean, if you just look at what happened in DC, there's been, it's almost kind of insane to look at what's happened over the last couple of weeks, right?You had Trump saying he was pro crypto.You had the SAB 121 votes in Congress, which we don't need to get the weeds there.But that's also a pro crypto um legislation.And the Senate had a bunch of Democrats including the majority leader, Chuck Schumer side with the cryptos uh vote and you had same, similar things happened with fit 21 which is another crypto Bill.Nancy Pelos.He sided with that 71 different Democrats.This was seemed to be a partisan decision, right?It seemed to be Democrats versus Republicans.Republicans were more pro some dems were still pro crypto.But for the most part that all shifted the minute that Trump basically said he was pro crypto.And I think that there's been a lot of things changing in DC over the last few weeks.Um As far as the ban goes, um, if you look at Ethereum compared to Bitcoin, just the asset the market cap of Ethereum is around 30% of Bitcoin.So if you take that into account you just translate that to ETF and you look at other ETF S around the world.So the US is not the first one to have an Ethereum and Bitcoin ETF.S. Um The demand is going to be a lot less than what we saw for Bitcoin.So we've seen about $13 billion of flows to the Bitcoin ETF since they launched on a net basis.Um So if you take in that 30% I think there's going to be even less than that 30 30% of interest.One, these things are not going to allow to stake, which is like a native yield that you would get in Ethereum.There's a lot more utility you lose by just sticking Ethereum into an ETF and not allowing to use it.So the demand will probably in our view be a little bit less than that 30% ratio.So it depends who you talk to, but it will still be likely billions of dollars that we're expecting to go in here.So it should be a monster success if and when we get, well, not if when we get those final approvals from, from the SEC for the issuers to actually launch these things.What is the timeline look like on that?We know there, I mean, anyone who tells you they know is lying or they're at the sec at this point as far as I'm concerned.Um There's a huge gap, right?So this can take as long as five months.There's examples of this taking five months before this gets through.Um I think the Bitcoin ETF is probably the more apt analogy and that took about three months, a lot of the language and concerns and issues that had to be ironed out between the sec on these risk disclosures.What these, these offering documents need to disclose to the people investing in them.A lot of it's been ironed out with the, the futures.ETF and the ETF so the Bitcoin ETF took 90 days, I think it will probably be less than 90 days.I think it could be weeks, but it also could be months.So like we don't really know, my gut tells me if they went and basically truly did a 180 like we think late last week, that means they took three days to get these 19 before approvals after usually taking 240 days of work before they actually get this stuff done, they can accelerate this.So I'm thinking it will be measured in weeks, pro multiple weeks, most likely at the very least, but it could be months.There's no way to know.So now with cryptocurrencies and, and specifically the Majors Bitcoin and Ethereum having their ETF asset class moment does the utilization value proposition or, or use case matter anymore?Um I think it does because it's still what matters is what's actually happening in the ecosystem of these assets, right.It's the ETF S are nice.They're great for people who want financial exposure, particularly if they're looking to do things in like a tax advantage account, like an IRA or they have money in a brokerage platform and they want to make sure they get exposure.What this is going to provide is financial exposure to the asset, investment exposure.If you want other, if there's other reasons why you would want access to these things, which there are, there's plenty of people doing things with Ethereum in the decentralized finance on these different decentralized platforms.Um Same with Bitcoin, there's sovereign store of wealth, you can kind of do what you want with it.You can take your own custody of your own asset, which you can't really do with much else, those things all still exist.But what this provides is it takes those assets from the defi world and puts them on the traditional financial rails in a very unique way.So there's this thing going on right now with a lot of these asset managers, it's going both direct, right?They, they're taking these digital native assets and putting them in these wrappers of the traditional financial world.But there's also examples of them taking traditional financial assets, things like money market funds and wrapping them and tokenizing them and putting them on the decentralized finance world.So a lot of these asset managers, these banks are probably going to play a lot at this intersection between these two things.Um And it's going to be fascinating to watch over the coming years.Really great context and insight James severed.Who is the Bloomberg Intelligence ETF research analyst James.Thanks so much for taking the time.Thanks for having me.Certainly, we're just getting started here on the morning brief coming up, Tesla reportedly slashing production of its model.Why in Shanghai?That is according to Reuters, what does this mean for the company's waning share in China and Live Nation is the latest target for the justice department, the US suing to break up Live Nation and Ticketmaster over alleged antitrust violations.We discuss the impact on the company all that much more coming up, Tesla dialing back in China, the EV maker reportedly slashing production of its model Y in Shanghai.This comes amid concerns of winning demand in the electric vehicle market.Let's put one big number on this 20%.Potentially.Here is what's the production cut from model Y at G of Shanghai could look like between March and June of 2024.And it seems like according to a few reports out there, this is also being cross referenced up against some of the information or data from the China Association of Auto Automobile Manufacturers, Brad.I think this all just boils down to that weaning demand that we've been talking about time and time again.So Tesla trying to right size the business there are at least better match what demand looks like when it comes to supply as a result, they're cutting just about 20% of that production output.Again, that's according to the latest numbers that have been crunched here by Reuters.But what more specifically this points to one obviously, this is happening in the midst of this price war that's been playing out, not only in China but also what we've been seeing across the world and then to just Tesla is up again, is facing an uphill battle.When it comes specifically to the China market, you talk about the increasing popularity and the increasing market share that you have byd.You have a number of those domestic players that are continually putting more pressure on Tesla, making it tougher to compete within that region with, with within that country.And then also just the geopolitical tension between the US and China clearly could be a potential challenge, not only for Tesla, but a number of us, larger us automakers here over the coming quarters over the coming years.So again, with all that in context here, you see Tesla making some adjustments to their production numbers, at least in China.But we'll see what the material impact is going to be on their sales in the quarters to come.I mean, you're spot on and it's hard to compete when you've got one of your biggest competitors in that region that's receiving subsidies from the nation as well.And so for China and the subsidies that they've been able to pass through to Byd for Tesla, regardless of the relationship that they've tried to strengthen within that, not just among regulators and among some of the broader officials and figureheads there, but also among the consumer, the consumer mindset also shifting too and it's gonna come on a price point basis as well here, especially if you are recognizing more of those cost savings on set as a consumer in buying a Byd versus a Tesla, then you're naturally going to gravitate towards one of those other options.And oh yeah, the broader industry is facing that slowdown in waiting demand as you were mentioning too here.So let's stay in the car landscape sticking to stress in the ev space as I uh so coincidentally ended on there, Lucid announcing a restructuring plan to optimize the company's operating expenses.The company is looking to trim its workforce by approximately 400 employees shares right now are up by about 1.1%.But you, you hate to see pops that are really for this company, especially if you look at the broader term here.Yeah, past two days.But if we tossed up a year to date chart for Lucid, it would be a much different picture here and even over the past 52 weeks, slippage year to date down 35% in here and it comes as the time where they're also in the broader kind of ev demand landscape.They're on the ultra luxury side of that too here.And so trying to woo some of the big money out there to buy into that luxury experience could be even tougher.Oh, yeah.And you've got more competition from the likes of Mercedes and some of the E offerings that they're putting out there as well as still Tesla too.Yeah, exactly.And this is just another by product or another effect here of the slowdown that we have seen in the adoption of the growth rate for s and as a result, a number of these companies facing these tough decisions.And it's also important to point out that Lucid is far from alone within having to announce layoffs here over the last couple of quarters.Even when you take into account what has happened in the last couple of months, you have Tesla announcing layoffs that it would cut about 10% of its workforce.Also, Vivian having multiple layoffs this year.So again, Lucid the latest to join that.And why is it happening?It's happening because of that uptake rate that you have been talking about the fact that consumers are feeling pressure, many consumers aren't out there making those bigger ticket purchases right now because rates are high and likely to stay high for longer here.When you take a look at the recent commentary that we're getting out from fed officials here this week.So all that taken into context.It's leading to weakening demand here in the US for a lot of these EV vehicles.And as a result, these ev manufacturers having to make adjustments to their business and unfortunately having to lay off hundreds of workers as a result here in an effort to cut costs.But when it comes to this restructuring effort out it saying that it's going to incur charges of about 21 to 25 million from this restructuring plan.The bulk of this is going to be recognized here in the current quarter.All right, let's take a look at into a shifting gears just a bit.The company missing Wall Street expectations for its fourth quarter profit forecast also though raising its full year revenue outlook, although not enough for the street and you're looking at losses of just about 6% digging into this report just a bit.A couple of key things I wanted to highlight here, Brad when it comes to the CEO of its credit Karma business, they will be retiring at the end of the year.So an executive change, that's something that, that analysts are making note of here this morning.And then also when it comes to turbotax, they higher price, TurboTax clients that did help boost sales during the tax season.But the company did see a decline in the lower end customers.Barclay is calling it out in their quick reaction to this print and that competition for these lower paying and free customers raises some questions that could concern investors here down the line.So I think that's one of the reasons in addition to that guidance falling just a bit shorter, not at least not enough to excite the street.One of the reasons why we're seeing that stock under pressure here this morning.I mean, it's a $35 billion market addressable market that they were talking about on the earnings call last night.And for TurboTax, I mean, they have been a household name for decades when it comes to filing your taxes.But coming back to your point here, it really does boil down to where some of those core users even over the years are saying, wait a minute, I can get this done for free, either by the government in some cases or just finding other cheaper services here.Why not lean into that?So that's one of the potential hits that we could see in this near term, at least in the investor sentiment.And the credit karma piece is interesting, especially at a time where so many consumers as we're looking across household balance sheets and continue to talk, especially on wealth, small pitch about the amount of people who are tapping or swiping their credit cards and how credit card debt is at high levels right now.All time, high levels that we've been tracking up against the number of people that are trying to figure out.Ok, how do I make sure that my credit is in good standing on the other side of this economic cycle.If we do see a recession and the consumer sentiment surveys and the data that continues to come out showcases exactly where, uh, more consumers are trying to prepare for that.If we do see a recession soon, something we're already in anyway.You know where we're already in, we're in the opening bell.You know why?Because that guy with the cowboy hat, hit the button at the NASDAQ there, you're taking a look at, I mean, that is, we would consider that a cowboy hat, right?It's up for debate.Cowboy look like a fedora.It's cowboy adjacent, cowboy fedora, adjacent cowboy chic, something like that.Anyway, you've got some bell ringers at the NASDAQ Memorial Day, uh, foundation.I think it was, uh, excellent group of folks over there.And then additionally, you saw the opening bell at the Nyse.Well, here's the market's activity out of the gate this morning.We're seeing green across the screen.Woof, man.That's good.All right.Dow Jones industrial average.That's up by about 1/10 of a percent.S and P 500 up 3/10 of a percent.And the NASDAQ finding out the hat trick we're up by about 3/10 of a percent.There.You see a bit of a rebound from yesterday.Sell off a lot of that.You had the Dow suffering its worst day that we had seen in just over a year.A lot of that was because of that drop that we saw in Boeing, which shares closing off just about 7.5% here at the Open Boeing is opening just slightly to the upside here.So again, a couple of key names to keep in mind throughout today's trading day, but Jared Bl has a closer look at what is moving here at the open and standing by with that, Jared.That's right, Sean.I'm looking at the Wi Fi Interactive.We have S and P 500 all five days here.You can see a slight decline for the week.If you take a look at the dow, it's more pronounced down 2% and the NASDAQ actually up two thirds of a percent.So a mixed board for the week, I did want to focus for a minute on yesterday's candle.Now, if you look at candlesticks, that's just a way of charting the day's price action.But that big red candle right there, that could have some ominous implications.There is a lot of focus on Twitter about it.Some people calling it a bearish engulfing, is it that uh candle?Uh that's a technical matter.But suffice to say that we've seen these before.Sometimes these candles do precipitate a decline.And so that's what people are looking at.Also want to show the Vix which is perking up here.Uh, the VX I think, opened yesterday at a, at the low of the year, I'm gonna show you a year to date.There we go low of the year and then it climbed throughout the day.Sometimes that kick off a rally in, uh, in the vics that lasts a few days.So we'll have to see, uh, if that confirms the equities weakness that we saw yesterday.And also I do want to hit on Eli Lilly real quickly because we got some news out of the Wall Street Journal.Uh Let me just get to that, Eli Lilly is going to spend 5.3 billion to make more Monro and Zip bound.And this is to boost their manual factoring capacity for its hot selling anti obesity drug Z bound and its diabetes drug Monja.This is Aws J.This is a Wall Street Journal scoop.So we will be following that and you're looking at the sector action here, you can see everything in the green for the week and let's see if we can get an Eli Lilly quote.Uh Here's our Rx screen and well, look at that.It is exactly flat.So there you go guys.All right, Jared.Thanks so much.Not too much movement here on the news that was just broken here by the Wall Street Journal.But Brad, why, why this is significant and why we're talking about this is just this unprecedented demand that we've seen for these weight loss drugs for these diabetes drugs.And these companies, Eli Lilly, when we take a look at Novo Nordis doing everything it can to keep up with that demand, trying to expand their manufacturing capacity.So again, this news here from Eli Lilly, the fact that they are expanding the manufacturing of that key ingredient for their weight loss and diabetes shots.And that key ingredient uh is transit.The fact that they are doing that is something that investors have wanted to see.Something that investors have asked executives about in most recent earnings calls just in terms of their ability to boost production and boost it in a very timely manner.So again, you would think news like this would likely at least please analysts and please investors just in terms of the fact that it's going to help them get more of that medication out the door quickly.Yeah, only two things that add to that one big number $100 billion is what Goldman Sachs is anticipating.This business could be or this broader industry could be in the addressable market by 2030 you look even further out and then we might even have more about the efficacy in other elements of life.And this brings me to my second point where you're seeing some of the additional health benefits, kidney functioning more properly, a positive effects on cognition.So all of these things, in addition to the weight management, marketability of some of the drugs here.That's where we might have between now and 2030.By the time we get to that 100 billion dollar addressable market, even more data to show the effectiveness.And uh I think by then, we could be looking at a whole different type of picture in terms of the number of companies, whether existing or newer that are playing within this space right now.And this news just released by Eli Lilly.Eli Lilly saying that it's increasing manufacturing investment to 9 billion at its newest Indiana site.It's boosting api production for trait like we were just talking about and also pipeline medicine.So again, just a name to keep in mind during today's trading day, we've got much more of your market action ahead.Stay tuned.You're watching morning breath, well, stocks opening higher for the day as follows.Yesterday's sell off with the dow looking to rebound following its worst day that we've seen since in over a year, but still though heading for a weekly loss.And when you take a look at the NASDAQ here today, up just about 4/10 of a percent, the NASDAQ in the greens.So checking in on NVIDIA, one of the big drivers of that tech movement here over the last several months, several quarters is just around the flat line today.But we do want to point out that NVIDIA closed the day yesterday up just about 9%.It was actually one of the only or the only mag seven name to close out yesterday in the Greens.Let's talk about what this means for the broader macro picture for that.We want to bring in Mike Nell.He is U BS Asset Management, senior portfolio manager, Mike, it's great to have you here at the desk.So talk to us just about how you're looking at this movement, this excitement that we've been seeing in NVIDIA surrounding these chip names and what that signals for the broader market.Well, NVIDIA obviously is the leader in A I processing.They have a technology called the GP U graphics processing unit, which they've evolved into an A I processing unit over time and they've specialized uh instructions and capabilities in those chips that have made them the leader in the space.They also have a, a software interface calcuta that allows people to easily program the chips uh for these A I applications and other uh applications that are what, what they call heavily parallel liable.And so uh it's a, it's a great uh story that NVIDIA has their, their revenue growth has been stupendous.Their profit growth has been even better.And um uh but there's a lot of competition coming when, when you have a market that's as, that's as profitable as this, it sort of draws a bull's eye for all the competition.And so there's a number of other companies that are coming after them, including a MD.Uh And uh uh we've also been owning stocks that uh support the chips but things like memory chips, uh you need lots of memory bandwidth to make these chips work.And uh so that's been another theme that's been working pretty well.We, we hear warm and always talk about moats.How deep or entrenched is the moat that NVIDIA has even in the face of that competition that you're mentioning on the A I front.It depends who you ask.If you ask NVIDIA, they think it's a, you know, solid boat that cannot be penetrated.Uh And, and it is very solid, I think.But if you ask Intel and A MD, there are ways to get around the coa interface.Uh There are third party and open uh interfaces that are being developed uh that uh they're supporting and uh they're doing everything they can to help the, the customers migrate their software from CU A to these open platforms.Uh That'll take time in the in the meantime, NVIDIA is gonna have quite a run, I think.So you can talk about quite a run.Are we just still in the early innings of this excitement surrounding A I?And then when we talk about real life applic application, how much of this hype and excitement has to do with what is happening currently versus what could happen in the next several years.I think a lot of it is already based on what could happen.You hear people talk not so much about applications for A I but what they call use cases and the use case is more of a theoretical application.It's not one that there's proven demand for today, but there are things that are likely to develop over time.So a lot of this is speculative.Everybody's got a fear of being left behind.So it's everything from companies.Uh even governments are buying these chips so that they can uh have an A I capability within their country.And uh a lot of it's on speculation, but it doesn't seem to be at this point quite as exaggerated as the internet bubble.I started as an analyst back in 1998.So I lived through that and uh that, that was different.Uh evaluations were really, really, really stretched during that period, not so much this time, I think.And so there was a massive fallout of uh a multitude of companies who were trying to latch on to the.com Fervor.Well, we see the same here within the A I landscape, I think.So.Uh you know, there's funny stories about, you know, just companies that announced that they had an internet capability back in 1999 in Chicago stock to go up tremendously.I think you'll probably see some examples of that with A I uh that probably with hindsight won't make so much sense.Uh But uh everybody's kind of getting in there uh the the best areas I think to focus on for investment are what people call like the picks and shovels area.So that would be the semiconductor companies like NVIDIA and others.Uh But also the uh the applications that are real today.So things like uh social media uh ad targeting or search those are areas where A I is already proven itself.Mike Nell U BS Asset Management, Senior portfolio manager.Mike, Thanks so much for joining us in studio.Thank you.Coming up, everyone.The DOJ has filed an antitrust lawsuit against concert ticket provider Live Nation.We'll have the details on the other side.Good news.If you're a Spectrum cable TV customer.Yesterday, Spectrum's parent company Charter Communications announced a new Multiyear distribution agreement for Paramount's full portfolio of linear cable networks, CBS owned and operated broadcast stations and direct to consumer streaming services.For more.We bring in our own Ali Canal.Hey Ali, what do we know?Hey, Red Yes, Paramount successfully avoiding a blackout of its channels on charter which if you remember that's what happened with Disney last September.So a big win there especially as these charter negotiations were viewed as a potential overhang for the company clouding some of those m and A prospects as Paramount seeks a buy out with Sky Dance media and possibly Apollo Global and Sony.Now there were still some unknown surrounding this deal, including what charter paid, but we do know that charter will continue to carry all of Paramount's networks including Showtime CBS and Paramount Plus.And the subscribers to charter's largest tier, along with its Spanish language tier will receive the ad supported versions of Paramount Plus and Bet plus at no additional cost.Now, Moff and Nathan and had a good point here that this agreement is a big deal since Paramount's TV media division is largely driven by the linear networks.That's a big driver of EBITA, a big driver of revenue.So having those channels on charter is important.There have been some expectations coming into these negotiations that some of Paramount's longer tail networks could get dropped.So again, a win but have to see what the carriage rates ended up being and how the payments were ultimately allocated to determine the long term financial impact.Here.There might also be some cannibalization on the subscriber front, but we should see some movement on a bigger strategic action or a possible deal.Now that this has been determined, you're seeing Paramount shares up about 1% shortly after the opening bell.All right, thanks so much for bringing that down for us.Turning to another story that we're following here at Yahoo Finance.The US government has filed a sweeping lawsuit against a live nation, the parent company of Ticketmaster.Now the doj along with 30 state and district attorneys general alleged live Nation has an unlawful dominance over the industry.The company controls about 70% of the ticketing for live events.Now Live Nation responded to the suit saying, quote, the defining feature of a monopolist is monopoly, profits derived from monopoly pricing.Live live Nation in no way fits the profile for more.We wanna bring in Jason Bazinet, he's the city's managing director covering Live Nation's Stock.And Jason, when we talk about this suit that we have from the DOJ against Live Nation.How strong do you think this antitrust lawsuit is?I don't think it's particularly strong.Um, I guess I would, I would make two points.The first is there is sort of a bigger picture, almost ideological thing that's going on here that has nothing to do with the companies.And that is for, um, most of the thirties, 19 forties, fifties, sixties, um, antitrust law is really governed by a mindset that was underpinned by what, what lawyers would call structuralism, which is big firms are bad.Why?Because they're big and what happened in the eighties nineties, you know, until today really has really been the price theory of competition which says that unless a firm causes consumer prices to rise, it's not really anti competitive.And this administration is trying to go back to structuralism, that's what's underpinning a lot of the antitrust actions that they're pursuing.Um And so that, that, that's difficult, I think for the judges to understand because they now have 40 plus years of case law that says this is really all about price and that's why you see Live Nation in their response focusing on price.If they are forced to break up with this, really have any material impact on prices paid.Let me just, uh, I don't think so.Um, let me just start with just some basics.I'm just going to say a hypothetical ticket, let's say that, um, costs $100.Um, Live Nation, um, makes about $1 for promoting that show.Um, the artist would get $99.And then when you, when you check out, when you actually buy the ticket, you're gonna see all of these fees and those are typically about, for $100 ticket would be about $30.And what most of that money goes to is the, the rental fee for the venue.And then Ticketmaster on the ticketing side is going to get about 20% of that $30 or $6.So at the end of the day, you check out, you're gonna pay as a consumer, 100 and $40 Live Nation's total revenue is a dollar for promoting the concert and about $6 for ticketing the concert.So they're gonna get $7.Um, so no matter what you do to live Nation, I'm not sure that you're going to see a demonstrable change in the price consumers pay to go to a concert.Jason does this suit though.How much of an overhang do you expect this to be on the stock or do you think it's gonna at least add a little bit of volatility to the stock price, at least here in the short term?I think the volatility has already happened.Um We've gone through the math of what a breakup would imply and it suggests something in the high eighties.And so what you saw is the market was very confident that the doj was going to file this lawsuit.And so it's been putting pressure on Live Nation's share price.Um And now, uh I, I think at least based on the conversations we've had with clients, um What it's going to go back to the fundamentals.This is going to be stuck in the court for years and years and years.If the stock price does well at Live Nation, it's because the fundamentals are good.If the stock does poorly, it's really more because the fundamentals are bad.But I think the market is baked in as we sit here today, very high probability that the suit is successful.Jason thanks so much for hopping on with us here today.Jason Bazinet City managing director, talking all things Live Nation Ticketmaster.We're gonna be tracking this DJ DOJ suit and everything to come around it.Jason, appreciate it.You bet.Thanks.We've got all your markets action ahead.Everyone.Stay tuned.You're watching Morning Brief, Burger King is reportedly launching a new $5 meal.Then they're not the only ones, a slew of fast food chains like mcdonald's and Wendy's launching value offerings of their own.After seeing consumers pull back on spending this week, we spoke to salad and Go Ceo Charlie Morrison on the sustainability of these offerings.Take a listen.Chains are taking lots and lots of price when they feel like they can.And then when the consumer starts to push back, we go right back into the cycle of value orientation.What doesn't seem to be working is the idea of sustaining an everyday low price and a price that consumers can afford.And so as we're watching, even more of these value offerings emerge, it typically does come at a time where many of the consumers are trying to look for value hacks.And so these value menu deals where even if you look back towards the great recession or the GFC, a lot of the promotions were centered around for mcdonald's and the Golden Arches.It was, hey, here's the $1 menu and, and you start to see some of these things sunset over time as they then kind of move and mirror with the economic cycle and try to promote other higher value menu items that they can perhaps take a little bit more price on.Yeah, but this just comes as consumers are under pressure, a lot of these companies are trying doing, trying to do everything they can to boost their profits, especially on the heels of what we've seen from an, a number of their competitors.When you take a look at what mcdonald's is doing.When you take a look at what Wendy's is doing.Burger King, it seems like at least feeling the need to jump in on this value trend that we have seen and offer that to customers in order to try and boost their foot traffic.And we take a look at exactly the pressure that these food companies have been under mcdonald's and their most recent report here, missing profit estimates for the first time in two years, this past quarter.And they said that they are seeing consumers starting to pull back.So there really is this emphasis on value that has been one of the themes that we've been tracking really throughout the season and it's beyond a number of these fast food chains.Even when you talk about some of the commentary that we've gotten out from Walmart from target, even from some of these off price discount retailers, people are looking for value, they're looking for cheaper options right now as they are being a little bit more discerning about what they're spending on and how they are spending.So you would think a deal like this would at least boost foot traffic.I think the question is, what kind of pressure could this ultimately maybe put on margins here, at least in the short term depending on how long these deals

post was written by luke carberry mogan video transcript9 a m  here in new york city i m john smith alongside brad smith and this is yahoo finance is like to show the morning brief was that features are moving to the upside here this morning recovering some of the losses on the worst session that we saw more than a year for the day that the do on these to drop about 2 5  for the week and we re looking at two mag seven members this morning in video and tesla video poised to hit a fresh record high and this comes as reuters reports  nvidia s oversupply of its a i chips prompted the company to cut prices in china meanwhile  tesla reportedly slashing production at its shanghai plan for its model why vehicle we dive into those stories this hour let s get right to it with the three things that you know on this friday morning  your road map of the trading day as we ve got yahoo finances  jennifer schomberg and anne for standing by with more stock futures moving higher this morning as the dow looks to recover from its worst session since march 2023 1 year ago stocks have been feeling the pressure this week after the fed minutes reignited concerns over the path of interest rates and with progress stalling on inflation  goldman sachs is pushing back on the timing for a potential rate cut from july to september the sec approved a rule change late thursday that paves the way for a spot of the etf approval story continuesthe next step  regulators will need to give fund managers approval before they can launch etf products so the timing of that remains unclear and we re on full elon musk watch this morning the giant tesla reportedly slashing production at its shanghai plan for its model why vehicle this coming amid concerns of wing demand in the electric vehicle market and must pushes back on a report of discussions over selling existing shares of space x at an undisclosed price that could value the company at  200 billion well  good morning everyone and a happy pre holiday weekend to you we re taking a look at some pre market moves ahead of this long holiday weekend  thursday choppy session for stocks  boeing  dragging the dow to its worst session since march of 2023 the nvidia bump also be called being called into question as strong economic data reinforces the good news is bad news narrative here so focusing in on some of the future s activity here this morning  you are seeing just a little bit of a move higher for the dow futures by about 2 10 of a percent and then additionally  attempting a little bit of a rebound from yesterday s and p 500 the nasdaq 100 also in positive territory right now  this is going to be really interesting to watch because like you said yesterday  a lot of that movement to the downside  the worst day that we ve seen for the dow in over a year that was attributable to that massive decline that we saw in boeing yesterday falling just around 7  i believe so again  a close  it s important to keep a close eye on that name when we talk about some of that movement  they falling just about 7 5  yesterday today  you can see this morning up just about 6 10 of a percent ahead of the open but we will see whether or not we will see a bounce back in some of those uh dow components here today and then also another big story that s going on in the market it s going to be critical here in today s session is the movement that we re seeing a lot of these larger cab names  especially what we re seeing play out in the tech sector because like you can see on your screen  there was certainly a lot of red across the board yesterday  nvidia  actually the only mag seven name to close out the day with gains and you re looking at a pop of just about 9  so nvidia wasn t enough for the broader market  but it was enough for investors to still find reason to buy that name on the heels of earnings you gotta imagine a lot of the talk around the grill this weekend is gonna be around nvidia  the stock split and the absolutely massive run that we ve seen over the course of this year for if you need a fast fact to toss out there to folks and try to impress some of your friends and family just remember up over 100  year to date for nvidia all right well  the raids debate surges on and the higher for longer narrative isn t going away just yet atlanta fed president rafael bostick noting that progress on inflation is still slow even if it has resumed falling now  goldman sachs economist also weighing in on race  jared b licky has the details on that jared that s right roth bostic is the latest of a plethora of fed speakers this week to come out saying that the fed may have to keep rates higher for longer that doesn t sound like anything new  but there are some new details here because the fed is in danger of being on the wrong side of inflation once again with uh everybody remembers the transitory episode from a few years ago as far as interest rates bostic is suggesting the federal reserve may need to delay cutting rates uh potentially keeping the current rate which is five and a quarter to 5 5  longer than expected because the us has not passed that critical point at which inflation we can say is in the rearview mirror and yesterday  it was only yesterday that we got the composite pmi s  those are purchasing purchasing manager manager index surveys those came out at the highest level since april of 2022 that s important for a number of reasons this is a small report that doesn t usually move the market  but it suggests according to s and p  what s what s interesting and this is a quote from s and p  what s interesting is that the main inflationary impetus is now coming from manufacturing rather than services so getting back to botek  another thing that he said was interest that i thought was interesting was the fed is going to conduct a new framework review of its inflation target in 2025 that s next year currently  that target is 2  but the fed has been making the case very slowly that maybe just maybe that needs to rise guys all right  jared thanks so much well  again  taking a look at the major averages here  you have futures moving to the upside it s looking to regain some of that momentum that it lost yesterday the dow coming off its worst day of the year now  the move lower yesterday coming despite the fact that nvidia once again posting another record breaking earnings report  it was not enough though to keep that market rally intact so here to break it all down and where we could see maybe pockets of strength going forward we want to bring in keith lerner he s truest  co chief investment officer and chief market strategist keith it s great to see you so talk to me about how you re looking at some of the losses that we saw yesterday and whether or not the narrative surrounding nvidia and some of that excitement has faded just a bit when we talk about the broader market action yeah well  first  uh shawna and brad always great to be with you  especially out of this long weekend i hope you guys get some downtime as well um so  you know  our view is this  first of all  we  we  we did upgrade um equities in late april um when we were down about 5  because we thought the risk reward had improved now  we moved up 7  expectations into that nvidia print was really high and it almost seemed like the anticipation of this report felt like ac p i employment day and if you know  you have been doing this for a long time that on those days  regardless of the number  the market often acts differently than you would expect and i think that s the case yesterday  but i also think what s kind of happening now is that we re moving past earnings season  one of the most steady things in our work has been forward earning estimates have been moving higher but now that you move past earnings season  the market hasn t now start focusing again on what is the fed gonna do and inflation and each economic data so that just makes for a more volatile market our underlying message is we still think the primary trend is higher i think their term  the market will be searching for a catalyst  which likely means that we re in more of a choppy period after that 7  rip up but again  we think the primary trend is still one that is positive who do you think is that next catalyst that could emerge keith well  i i think  um you know  first of all  i m gonna go through the summer months so it s  i mean  even just kind of going through back and forth um is  is actually  i think fine  i think the catalyst for the market um is  is probably to start seeing more disinflationary pressures which as as sharon just mentioned  we got almost the  the opposite of that yesterday so for the market to actually move high in a meaningful way  we likely need rates to actually break below this 430 level in the 10 year treasury and the market get more comfortable but that  that there s more this inflationary pressures that will allow the fed later this year to at least cut  you know  once or or twice i don t think it matters if it s june or september i think the main most important thing for the market is that it s more likely that they cut if the message really starts to change  that they have to raise rates  which is not our base case i think that would be the biggest concern for the overall overall market keith  are you seeing any signs of exuberance in the market at this point when you take a look at valuations and where we are today well  so i think there  there s some signs in the last week or so i mean  we saw some signs as far as the meme stocks  we saw some strategists on the street really just lift their targets  you know  pretty meaningfully in a short period of time if you look at the options market  there s almost no demand for  for downside protection um so i think that s more of a  a shorter term i don t think it s  you know  exuberance i just think that it s one of those things where you  where when you have those type of things happen  it s not unusual to have a little bit of  of a  of a gut check or gut check in the overall market and that s what i think we re  we re having and i also think  listen  when we get back from memorial day  you get into june  you re gonna seeing the presidential election um and i think people are gonna start focusing on that that s gonna add another dynamic as far as just this kind of more of a two way trade even within that uptrend that we still think is intact when there are those pockets of volatility heath  where are some of the top dip buying opportunities emerging from your purview well  i  you know  i actually still think um that  that  that tech and communications is still leadership in fact  uh yesterday  one thing we look at is relative price  momentum and relative trends um of each sector to the overall market and what we did yesterday at the nvidia print  which makes sense is we broke out to an all time high after consolidating so what that tells us is tech remains leadership we ve been overweight that reaffirms our overweight the other thing that we look at is the earnings momentum for the overall sector is still much stronger than the overall market when that happens  historically  tech remains leadership and i will say  you know  if you look into the  the  the surface  you know  while the s and p broke out to new highs and we re still positive below the surface  we didn t see the follow through from mid caps or small caps or some of these interest rate sensitive areas so we would really be fo focused more on that large cap space and  and really still like tech and communications as two of our favorite sectors  you know  uh keith  as we look out to next week  we re also gonna get one more big earnings report here coming in the form of sales force now  nvidia has also been called  they ve already been dubbed the  the de facto a i play by goldman  but is  is sales force almost brewing as maybe aaa de facto junior as it relates to some of the software services side of this business and the  and the elements that can immediately kind of be tangibly touched within workplaces yeah  i  i think  i think that s  that s fair i mean  i think  i think the sales force  you think about it oracle  what you wanna see is  is the a i benefit accruing beyond  you know  one big company  right and  and i think that from from market perspective  you  you do want to see it  it boiling out to be a be beyond that and if you had something that was really weak there  then again  i think on a short period  tech is the biggest sector that could weigh on things but overall  i still think if you kind of zoom out a bit  you know  our perspective on artificial intelligence um and also the earning trends  i think as far as you know  the spend on that is we re still pretty early cycle even if the economy slows down  even if there s all these uncertainty  i think companies will have to continue to invest in a i and tech otherwise they re gonna be left behind so i think there is a tail and bigger picture but as you mentioned  i think in a week next week as we winding down earnings  that will be an important report yeah  even as i m sitting here previewing sales forces earnings and calling them de facto junior for a  i imagine  uh  the meta platforms and microsoft or somewhere saying hold my beer we ve got a lot that we re doing in this area too keith lerner great to see you thanks so much for taking the time great to be with you take care absolutely the sec approving a rule change paving the way for spot ethereum etf approval the next step  fund managers need approval from the agency before they can launch etf products now  the timeline on that it s still unclear so for more on this  we ve got the person to bring us some clarity on this yahoo finance reporter jennifer schonberger here with us hey jennifer  good morning  brad that s right the sec giving a green light to the new york stock exchange and the nasdaq to begin listing exchange traded funds that hold either but it has yet to give approval to money managers that want to issue these new funds the move marks the first step towards allowing these etf to trade the sec would need to offer approval though  for the money managers filings for those actual funds to begin trading  though the regulator has not given any indication of when that could happen the cohort seeking approval for these ether etf s include some of wall street s biggest names from black rock fidelity and franklin templeton to a number of firms better known in the crypto world including gray scale and bit wise this decision coming roughly four months after the sec approved spot bitcoin etf for the first time after years of denying approval  sec chair  gary ginzler  speaking at a conference here in washington early on thursday morning ahead of the order said that the sec is very deeply committed to following the law and how courts interpret the law that the sec had picked up formally on what the previous sec chair uh clayton was doing in this field around exchange traded products but after he says two dozen orders from the commission  the ruling from the dc circuit court of appeals took a different view and the sec has now taken that into consideration and pivoted hence why we re seeing the groundwork here laid for an e spot etf of course  the race is on in terms of speculating for when we could see approval for those actual money managers  we will be keeping an eye on that e has been pretty volatile on the back of this down about i think 4  last day check still it was trading around 3700 guys  jennifer  thanks so much for teeing up this next conversation for more on the ether etf news we bring in james seaford who is the bloomberg intelligence etf research analyst great to have you here with us and thanks for hopping on this morning i mean  how significant is this for ethereum and how many of the other  perhaps alt coins out there could be watching this and saying we  we  we got a shot maybe yeah thanks for having me  brad um  i  i don t think the other ones have that much of a shot in the near term um  look  the bitcoin etf got approved because we have a regulated  a federally regulated cme bitcoin futures market and basically the sec said we re not going to approve anything unless we have a market that we can surveil um  and that we can make sure there s no fraud and manipulation going on so that was basically what the dc circuit court that she was just talking about allowed for the bitcoin etf to get approval ethereum is the only other digital app that has a federally regulated futures market that trades with enough size and enough frequency that theoretically the sec could look for some sort of fraud and manipulation that doesn t really exist anywhere else that said things are moving very fast the political winds have shifted i mean  over just about a week ago  we didn t think this was going to happen  but everything really changed on monday  there was a complete 180 as far as we re concerned from dc and the sec on this topic  we think that they were likely going to deny these things until sometime late last week james what do you think one  what changed and two  what do you think demand is going to look like then for these potential  uh  spot  uh e three etf s yeah  i mean  what changed is political wind shifted i mean  if you just look at what happened in dc  there s been  it s almost kind of insane to look at what s happened over the last couple of weeks  right you had trump saying he was pro crypto you had the sab 121 votes in congress  which we don t need to get the weeds there but that s also a pro crypto um legislation and the senate had a bunch of democrats including the majority leader  chuck schumer side with the cryptos uh vote and you had same  similar things happened with fit 21 which is another crypto bill nancy pelos he sided with that 71 different democrats this was seemed to be a partisan decision  right it seemed to be democrats versus republicans republicans were more pro some dems were still pro crypto but for the most part that all shifted the minute that trump basically said he was pro crypto and i think that there s been a lot of things changing in dc over the last few weeks um as far as the ban goes  um  if you look at ethereum compared to bitcoin  just the asset the market cap of ethereum is around 30  of bitcoin so if you take that into account you just translate that to etf and you look at other etf s around the world so the us is not the first one to have an ethereum and bitcoin etf s  um the demand is going to be a lot less than what we saw for bitcoin so we ve seen about  13 billion of flows to the bitcoin etf since they launched on a net basis um so if you take in that 30  i think there s going to be even less than that 30 30  of interest one  these things are not going to allow to stake  which is like a native yield that you would get in ethereum there s a lot more utility you lose by just sticking ethereum into an etf and not allowing to use it so the demand will probably in our view be a little bit less than that 30  ratio so it depends who you talk to  but it will still be likely billions of dollars that we re expecting to go in here so it should be a monster success if and when we get  well  not if when we get those final approvals from  from the sec for the issuers to actually launch these things what is the timeline look like on that we know there  i mean  anyone who tells you they know is lying or they re at the sec at this point as far as i m concerned um there s a huge gap  right so this can take as long as five months there s examples of this taking five months before this gets through um i think the bitcoin etf is probably the more apt analogy and that took about three months  a lot of the language and concerns and issues that had to be ironed out between the sec on these risk disclosures what these  these offering documents need to disclose to the people investing in them a lot of it s been ironed out with the  the futures etf and the etf so the bitcoin etf took 90 days  i think it will probably be less than 90 days i think it could be weeks  but it also could be months so like we don t really know  my gut tells me if they went and basically truly did a 180 like we think late last week  that means they took three days to get these 19 before approvals after usually taking 240 days of work before they actually get this stuff done  they can accelerate this so i m thinking it will be measured in weeks  pro multiple weeks  most likely at the very least  but it could be months there s no way to know so now with cryptocurrencies and  and specifically the majors bitcoin and ethereum having their etf asset class moment does the utilization value proposition or  or use case matter anymore um i think it does because it s still what matters is what s actually happening in the ecosystem of these assets  right it s the etf s are nice they re great for people who want financial exposure  particularly if they re looking to do things in like a tax advantage account  like an ira or they have money in a brokerage platform and they want to make sure they get exposure what this is going to provide is financial exposure to the asset  investment exposure if you want other  if there s other reasons why you would want access to these things  which there are  there s plenty of people doing things with ethereum in the decentralized finance on these different decentralized platforms um same with bitcoin  there s sovereign store of wealth  you can kind of do what you want with it you can take your own custody of your own asset  which you can t really do with much else  those things all still exist but what this provides is it takes those assets from the defi world and puts them on the traditional financial rails in a very unique way so there s this thing going on right now with a lot of these asset managers  it s going both direct  right they  they re taking these digital native assets and putting them in these wrappers of the traditional financial world but there s also examples of them taking traditional financial assets  things like money market funds and wrapping them and tokenizing them and putting them on the decentralized finance world so a lot of these asset managers  these banks are probably going to play a lot at this intersection between these two things um and it s going to be fascinating to watch over the coming years really great context and insight james severed who is the bloomberg intelligence etf research analyst james thanks so much for taking the time thanks for having me certainly  we re just getting started here on the morning brief coming up  tesla reportedly slashing production of its model why in shanghai that is according to reuters  what does this mean for the company s waning share in china and live nation is the latest target for the justice department  the us suing to break up live nation and ticketmaster over alleged antitrust violations we discuss the impact on the company all that much more coming up  tesla dialing back in china  the ev maker reportedly slashing production of its model y in shanghai this comes amid concerns of winning demand in the electric vehicle market let s put one big number on this 20  potentially here is what s the production cut from model y at g of shanghai could look like between march and june of 2024 and it seems like according to a few reports out there  this is also being cross referenced up against some of the information or data from the china association of auto automobile manufacturers  brad i think this all just boils down to that weaning demand that we ve been talking about time and time again so tesla trying to right size the business there are at least better match what demand looks like when it comes to supply as a result  they re cutting just about 20  of that production output again  that s according to the latest numbers that have been crunched here by reuters but what more specifically this points to one obviously  this is happening in the midst of this price war that s been playing out  not only in china but also what we ve been seeing across the world and then to just tesla is up again  is facing an uphill battle when it comes specifically to the china market  you talk about the increasing popularity and the increasing market share that you have byd you have a number of those domestic players that are continually putting more pressure on tesla  making it tougher to compete within that region with  with within that country and then also just the geopolitical tension between the us and china clearly could be a potential challenge  not only for tesla  but a number of us  larger us automakers here over the coming quarters over the coming years so again  with all that in context here  you see tesla making some adjustments to their production numbers  at least in china but we ll see what the material impact is going to be on their sales in the quarters to come i mean  you re spot on and it s hard to compete when you ve got one of your biggest competitors in that region that s receiving subsidies from the nation as well and so for china and the subsidies that they ve been able to pass through to byd for tesla  regardless of the relationship that they ve tried to strengthen within that  not just among regulators and among some of the broader officials and figureheads there  but also among the consumer  the consumer mindset also shifting too and it s gonna come on a price point basis as well here  especially if you are recognizing more of those cost savings on set as a consumer in buying a byd versus a tesla  then you re naturally going to gravitate towards one of those other options and oh yeah  the broader industry is facing that slowdown in waiting demand as you were mentioning too here so let s stay in the car landscape sticking to stress in the ev space as i uh so coincidentally ended on there  lucid announcing a restructuring plan to optimize the company s operating expenses the company is looking to trim its workforce by approximately 400 employees shares right now are up by about 1 1  but you  you hate to see pops that are really for this company  especially if you look at the broader term here yeah  past two days but if we tossed up a year to date chart for lucid  it would be a much different picture here and even over the past 52 weeks  slippage year to date down 35  in here and it comes as the time where they re also in the broader kind of ev demand landscape they re on the ultra luxury side of that too here and so trying to woo some of the big money out there to buy into that luxury experience could be even tougher oh  yeah and you ve got more competition from the likes of mercedes and some of the e offerings that they re putting out there as well as still tesla too yeah  exactly and this is just another by product or another effect here of the slowdown that we have seen in the adoption of the growth rate for s and as a result  a number of these companies facing these tough decisions and it s also important to point out that lucid is far from alone within having to announce layoffs here over the last couple of quarters even when you take into account what has happened in the last couple of months  you have tesla announcing layoffs that it would cut about 10  of its workforce also  vivian having multiple layoffs this year so again  lucid the latest to join that and why is it happening it s happening because of that uptake rate that you have been talking about the fact that consumers are feeling pressure  many consumers aren t out there making those bigger ticket purchases right now because rates are high and likely to stay high for longer here when you take a look at the recent commentary that we re getting out from fed officials here this week so all that taken into context it s leading to weakening demand here in the us for a lot of these ev vehicles and as a result  these ev manufacturers having to make adjustments to their business and unfortunately having to lay off hundreds of workers as a result here in an effort to cut costs but when it comes to this restructuring effort out it saying that it s going to incur charges of about 21 to 25 million from this restructuring plan the bulk of this is going to be recognized here in the current quarter all right  let s take a look at into a shifting gears just a bit the company missing wall street expectations for its fourth quarter profit forecast also though raising its full year revenue outlook  although not enough for the street and you re looking at losses of just about 6  digging into this report just a bit a couple of key things i wanted to highlight here  brad when it comes to the ceo of its credit karma business  they will be retiring at the end of the year so an executive change  that s something that  that analysts are making note of here this morning and then also when it comes to turbotax  they higher price  turbotax clients that did help boost sales during the tax season but the company did see a decline in the lower end customers barclay is calling it out in their quick reaction to this print and that competition for these lower paying and free customers raises some questions that could concern investors here down the line so i think that s one of the reasons in addition to that guidance falling just a bit shorter  not at least not enough to excite the street one of the reasons why we re seeing that stock under pressure here this morning i mean  it s a  35 billion market addressable market that they were talking about on the earnings call last night and for turbotax  i mean  they have been a household name for decades when it comes to filing your taxes but coming back to your point here  it really does boil down to where some of those core users even over the years are saying  wait a minute  i can get this done for free  either by the government in some cases or just finding other cheaper services here why not lean into that so that s one of the potential hits that we could see in this near term  at least in the investor sentiment and the credit karma piece is interesting  especially at a time where so many consumers as we re looking across household balance sheets and continue to talk  especially on wealth  small pitch about the amount of people who are tapping or swiping their credit cards and how credit card debt is at high levels right now all time  high levels that we ve been tracking up against the number of people that are trying to figure out ok  how do i make sure that my credit is in good standing on the other side of this economic cycle if we do see a recession and the consumer sentiment surveys and the data that continues to come out showcases exactly where  uh  more consumers are trying to prepare for that if we do see a recession soon  something we re already in anyway you know where we re already in  we re in the opening bell you know why because that guy with the cowboy hat  hit the button at the nasdaq there  you re taking a look at  i mean  that is  we would consider that a cowboy hat  right it s up for debate cowboy look like a fedora it s cowboy adjacent  cowboy fedora  adjacent cowboy chic  something like that anyway  you ve got some bell ringers at the nasdaq memorial day  uh  foundation i think it was  uh  excellent group of folks over there and then additionally  you saw the opening bell at the nyse well  here s the market s activity out of the gate this morning we re seeing green across the screen woof  man that s good all right dow jones industrial average that s up by about 1 10 of a percent s and p 500 up 3 10 of a percent and the nasdaq finding out the hat trick we re up by about 3 10 of a percent there you see a bit of a rebound from yesterday sell off a lot of that you had the dow suffering its worst day that we had seen in just over a year a lot of that was because of that drop that we saw in boeing  which shares closing off just about 7 5  here at the open boeing is opening just slightly to the upside here so again  a couple of key names to keep in mind throughout today s trading day  but jared bl has a closer look at what is moving here at the open and standing by with that  jared that s right  sean i m looking at the wi fi interactive we have s and p 500 all five days here you can see a slight decline for the week if you take a look at the dow  it s more pronounced down 2  and the nasdaq actually up two thirds of a percent so a mixed board for the week  i did want to focus for a minute on yesterday s candle now  if you look at candlesticks  that s just a way of charting the day s price action but that big red candle right there  that could have some ominous implications there is a lot of focus on twitter about it some people calling it a bearish engulfing  is it that uh candle uh that s a technical matter but suffice to say that we ve seen these before sometimes these candles do precipitate a decline and so that s what people are looking at also want to show the vix which is perking up here uh  the vx i think  opened yesterday at a  at the low of the year  i m gonna show you a year to date there we go low of the year and then it climbed throughout the day sometimes that kick off a rally in  uh  in the vics that lasts a few days so we ll have to see  uh  if that confirms the equities weakness that we saw yesterday and also i do want to hit on eli lilly real quickly because we got some news out of the wall street journal uh let me just get to that  eli lilly is going to spend 5 3 billion to make more monro and zip bound and this is to boost their manual factoring capacity for its hot selling anti obesity drug z bound and its diabetes drug monja this is aws j this is a wall street journal scoop so we will be following that and you re looking at the sector action here  you can see everything in the green for the week and let s see if we can get an eli lilly quote uh here s our rx screen and well  look at that it is exactly flat so there you go guys all right  jared thanks so much not too much movement here on the news that was just broken here by the wall street journal but brad  why  why this is significant and why we re talking about this is just this unprecedented demand that we ve seen for these weight loss drugs for these diabetes drugs and these companies  eli lilly  when we take a look at novo nordis doing everything it can to keep up with that demand  trying to expand their manufacturing capacity so again  this news here from eli lilly  the fact that they are expanding the manufacturing of that key ingredient for their weight loss and diabetes shots and that key ingredient uh is transit the fact that they are doing that is something that investors have wanted to see something that investors have asked executives about in most recent earnings calls just in terms of their ability to boost production and boost it in a very timely manner so again  you would think news like this would likely at least please analysts and please investors just in terms of the fact that it s going to help them get more of that medication out the door quickly yeah  only two things that add to that one big number  100 billion is what goldman sachs is anticipating this business could be or this broader industry could be in the addressable market by 2030 you look even further out and then we might even have more about the efficacy in other elements of life and this brings me to my second point where you re seeing some of the additional health benefits  kidney functioning more properly  a positive effects on cognition so all of these things  in addition to the weight management  marketability of some of the drugs here that s where we might have between now and 2030 by the time we get to that 100 billion dollar addressable market  even more data to show the effectiveness and uh i think by then  we could be looking at a whole different type of picture in terms of the number of companies  whether existing or newer that are playing within this space right now and this news just released by eli lilly eli lilly saying that it s increasing manufacturing investment to 9 billion at its newest indiana site it s boosting api production for trait like we were just talking about and also pipeline medicine so again  just a name to keep in mind during today s trading day  we ve got much more of your market action ahead stay tuned you re watching morning breath  well  stocks opening higher for the day as follows yesterday s sell off with the dow looking to rebound following its worst day that we ve seen since in over a year  but still though heading for a weekly loss and when you take a look at the nasdaq here today  up just about 4 10 of a percent  the nasdaq in the greens so checking in on nvidia  one of the big drivers of that tech movement here over the last several months  several quarters is just around the flat line today but we do want to point out that nvidia closed the day yesterday up just about 9  it was actually one of the only or the only mag seven name to close out yesterday in the greens let s talk about what this means for the broader macro picture for that we want to bring in mike nell he is u bs asset management  senior portfolio manager  mike  it s great to have you here at the desk so talk to us just about how you re looking at this movement  this excitement that we ve been seeing in nvidia surrounding these chip names and what that signals for the broader market well  nvidia obviously is the leader in a i processing they have a technology called the gp u graphics processing unit  which they ve evolved into an a i processing unit over time and they ve specialized uh instructions and capabilities in those chips that have made them the leader in the space they also have a  a software interface calcuta that allows people to easily program the chips uh for these a i applications and other uh applications that are what  what they call heavily parallel liable and so uh it s a  it s a great uh story that nvidia has their  their revenue growth has been stupendous their profit growth has been even better and um uh but there s a lot of competition coming when  when you have a market that s as  that s as profitable as this  it sort of draws a bull s eye for all the competition and so there s a number of other companies that are coming after them  including a md uh and uh uh we ve also been owning stocks that uh support the chips but things like memory chips  uh you need lots of memory bandwidth to make these chips work and uh so that s been another theme that s been working pretty well we  we hear warm and always talk about moats how deep or entrenched is the moat that nvidia has even in the face of that competition that you re mentioning on the a i front it depends who you ask if you ask nvidia  they think it s a  you know  solid boat that cannot be penetrated uh and  and it is very solid  i think but if you ask intel and a md  there are ways to get around the coa interface uh there are third party and open uh interfaces that are being developed uh that uh they re supporting and uh they re doing everything they can to help the  the customers migrate their software from cu a to these open platforms uh that ll take time in the in the meantime  nvidia is gonna have quite a run  i think so you can talk about quite a run are we just still in the early innings of this excitement surrounding a i and then when we talk about real life applic application  how much of this hype and excitement has to do with what is happening currently versus what could happen in the next several years i think a lot of it is already based on what could happen you hear people talk not so much about applications for a i but what they call use cases and the use case is more of a theoretical application it s not one that there s proven demand for today  but there are things that are likely to develop over time so a lot of this is speculative everybody s got a fear of being left behind so it s everything from companies uh even governments are buying these chips so that they can uh have an a i capability within their country and uh a lot of it s on speculation  but it doesn t seem to be at this point quite as exaggerated as the internet bubble i started as an analyst back in 1998 so i lived through that and uh that  that was different uh evaluations were really  really  really stretched during that period  not so much this time  i think and so there was a massive fallout of uh a multitude of companies who were trying to latch on to the com fervor well  we see the same here within the a i landscape  i think so uh you know  there s funny stories about  you know  just companies that announced that they had an internet capability back in 1999 in chicago stock to go up tremendously i think you ll probably see some examples of that with a i uh that probably with hindsight won t make so much sense uh but uh everybody s kind of getting in there uh the the best areas i think to focus on for investment are what people call like the picks and shovels area so that would be the semiconductor companies like nvidia and others uh but also the uh the applications that are real today so things like uh social media uh ad targeting or search those are areas where a i is already proven itself mike nell u bs asset management  senior portfolio manager mike  thanks so much for joining us in studio thank you coming up  everyone the doj has filed an antitrust lawsuit against concert ticket provider live nation we ll have the details on the other side good news if you re a spectrum cable tv customer yesterday  spectrum s parent company charter communications announced a new multiyear distribution agreement for paramount s full portfolio of linear cable networks  cbs owned and operated broadcast stations and direct to consumer streaming services for more we bring in our own ali canal hey ali  what do we know hey  red yes  paramount successfully avoiding a blackout of its channels on charter which if you remember that s what happened with disney last september so a big win there especially as these charter negotiations were viewed as a potential overhang for the company clouding some of those m and a prospects as paramount seeks a buy out with sky dance media and possibly apollo global and sony now there were still some unknown surrounding this deal  including what charter paid  but we do know that charter will continue to carry all of paramount s networks including showtime cbs and paramount plus and the subscribers to charter s largest tier  along with its spanish language tier will receive the ad supported versions of paramount plus and bet plus at no additional cost now  moff and nathan and had a good point here that this agreement is a big deal since paramount s tv media division is largely driven by the linear networks that s a big driver of ebita  a big driver of revenue so having those channels on charter is important there have been some expectations coming into these negotiations that some of paramount s longer tail networks could get dropped so again  a win but have to see what the carriage rates ended up being and how the payments were ultimately allocated to determine the long term financial impact here there might also be some cannibalization on the subscriber front  but we should see some movement on a bigger strategic action or a possible deal now that this has been determined  you re seeing paramount shares up about 1  shortly after the opening bell all right  thanks so much for bringing that down for us turning to another story that we re following here at yahoo finance the us government has filed a sweeping lawsuit against a live nation  the parent company of ticketmaster now the doj along with 30 state and district attorneys general alleged live nation has an unlawful dominance over the industry the company controls about 70  of the ticketing for live events now live nation responded to the suit saying  quote  the defining feature of a monopolist is monopoly  profits derived from monopoly pricing live live nation in no way fits the profile for more we wanna bring in jason bazinet  he s the city s managing director covering live nation s stock and jason  when we talk about this suit that we have from the doj against live nation how strong do you think this antitrust lawsuit is i don t think it s particularly strong um  i guess i would  i would make two points the first is there is sort of a bigger picture  almost ideological thing that s going on here that has nothing to do with the companies and that is for  um  most of the thirties  19 forties  fifties  sixties  um  antitrust law is really governed by a mindset that was underpinned by what  what lawyers would call structuralism  which is big firms are bad why because they re big and what happened in the eighties nineties  you know  until today really has really been the price theory of competition which says that unless a firm causes consumer prices to rise  it s not really anti competitive and this administration is trying to go back to structuralism  that s what s underpinning a lot of the antitrust actions that they re pursuing um and so that  that  that s difficult  i think for the judges to understand because they now have 40 plus years of case law that says this is really all about price and that s why you see live nation in their response focusing on price if they are forced to break up with this  really have any material impact on prices paid let me just  uh  i don t think so um  let me just start with just some basics i m just going to say a hypothetical ticket  let s say that  um  costs  100 um  live nation  um  makes about  1 for promoting that show um  the artist would get  99 and then when you  when you check out  when you actually buy the ticket  you re gonna see all of these fees and those are typically about  for  100 ticket would be about  30 and what most of that money goes to is the  the rental fee for the venue and then ticketmaster on the ticketing side is going to get about 20  of that  30 or  6 so at the end of the day  you check out  you re gonna pay as a consumer  100 and  40 live nation s total revenue is a dollar for promoting the concert and about  6 for ticketing the concert so they re gonna get  7 um  so no matter what you do to live nation  i m not sure that you re going to see a demonstrable change in the price consumers pay to go to a concert jason does this suit though how much of an overhang do you expect this to be on the stock or do you think it s gonna at least add a little bit of volatility to the stock price  at least here in the short term i think the volatility has already happened um we ve gone through the math of what a breakup would imply and it suggests something in the high eighties and so what you saw is the market was very confident that the doj was going to file this lawsuit and so it s been putting pressure on live nation s share price um and now  uh i  i think at least based on the conversations we ve had with clients  um what it s going to go back to the fundamentals this is going to be stuck in the court for years and years and years if the stock price does well at live nation  it s because the fundamentals are good if the stock does poorly  it s really more because the fundamentals are bad but i think the market is baked in as we sit here today  very high probability that the suit is successful jason thanks so much for hopping on with us here today jason bazinet city managing director  talking all things live nation ticketmaster we re gonna be tracking this dj doj suit and everything to come around it jason  appreciate it you bet thanks we ve got all your markets action ahead everyone stay tuned you re watching morning brief  burger king is reportedly launching a new  5 meal then they re not the only ones  a slew of fast food chains like mcdonald s and wendy s launching value offerings of their own after seeing consumers pull back on spending this week  we spoke to salad and go ceo charlie morrison on the sustainability of these offerings take a listen chains are taking lots and lots of price when they feel like they can and then when the consumer starts to push back  we go right back into the cycle of value orientation what doesn t seem to be working is the idea of sustaining an everyday low price and a price that consumers can afford and so as we re watching  even more of these value offerings emerge  it typically does come at a time where many of the consumers are trying to look for value hacks and so these value menu deals where even if you look back towards the great recession or the gfc  a lot of the promotions were centered around for mcdonald s and the golden arches it was  hey  here s the  1 menu and  and you start to see some of these things sunset over time as they then kind of move and mirror with the economic cycle and try to promote other higher value menu items that they can perhaps take a little bit more price on yeah  but this just comes as consumers are under pressure  a lot of these companies are trying doing  trying to do everything they can to boost their profits  especially on the heels of what we ve seen from an  a number of their competitors when you take a look at what mcdonald s is doing when you take a look at what wendy s is doing burger king  it seems like at least feeling the need to jump in on this value trend that we have seen and offer that to customers in order to try and boost their foot traffic and we take a look at exactly the pressure that these food companies have been under mcdonald s and their most recent report here  missing profit estimates for the first time in two years  this past quarter and they said that they are seeing consumers starting to pull back so there really is this emphasis on value that has been one of the themes that we ve been tracking really throughout the season and it s beyond a number of these fast food chains even when you talk about some of the commentary that we ve gotten out from walmart from target  even from some of these off price discount retailers  people are looking for value  they re looking for cheaper options right now as they are being a little bit more discerning about what they re spending on and how they are spending so you would think a deal like this would at least boost foot traffic i think the question is  what kind of pressure could this ultimately maybe put on margins here  at least in the short term depending on how long these deals are available for and in that margin equation too  if you re saying hello to value  you might be saying goodbye in the near term to menu innovation to the extent that companies talk about that and the amount of money that they put into spending on new creative products that they re able to list on the menu even more of the foot traffic now it s ok  let s stick to what works see how we can re bundle it or repackage it in the same great burger or sandwich that you ve tried before  whether it be spicy chicken or whether it be a triple quarter pounder whopper  whatever you re naming it here  it could just be variation in what they re calling the burgers or calling the different menu items at this juncture and how it s being marketed and in the franchisee mindset  they re going to be looking for even more of that directive to come down from some of these companies  whether it be mcdonald s  whether it be restaurant brands and how they re working with their franchisees to make sure more of the marketing elements are continuing to engage with more customers who are looking for those deals will keep right here on yahoo finance coming up the latest reading on consumer sentiment that s out in just a few minutes we will break down the numbers and exactly what this report could signal for the fed plus a i disrupting the energy landscape we will be speaking with the ceo of a same allman backed nuclear energy company that s coming up on catalyst next ',

                        "A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Ford Motor Company (F). Shares have lost about 7.1% in that time frame, underperforming the S&P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Ford Motor due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Ford Q1 Earnings Beat Estimates But Fall Y/YFord reported first-quarter 2024 adjusted EPS of 49 cents, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 42 cents but declined from 63 cents recorded in the year-ago quarter.

                        'South Korean semiconductor foundry company SK Keyfoundry has agreed to supply power semiconductors for fitment in Tesla vehicles from the second half of 2024, according to local reports.The company, known as Key Foundry before it was acquired by local chipmaker SK Hynix in 2022, last month unveiled a new improved 0.13㎛ BCD process for the production of high-performance automotive power semiconductors. The company is specifically targeting fabless producers of automotive power chips, with the aim of helping automakers compete with China’s increasing dominance of the global battery electric vehicle (BEV) segment.The Chinese government has been nurturing the development of local foundry companies such Hua Hong Semiconductor and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC) with substantial subsidies. According to reports these companies have significantly lowered their prices for local automakers, helping them gain their competitive edge.SK Keyfoundry is understood to be ready to begin producing its Power Management Integrated Circuits (PMIC) to be used in Tesla’s BEVs from July at its 8-inch wafer fab in Cheongju – some 100km south of the South Korean capital Seoul. The facility, which has a production capacity of 100,000 8-inch wafers per month, specialises in multi-product small-quantity production.The deal with the world’s largest BEV producer is seen as a major breakthrough for the company, given Tesla significant influence in the global BEV industry in terms of setting technology standards. The automaker is known for its stringent requirements for semiconductors, for which reliability and performance is critical.SK Keyfoundry has also been working to supply its new chips to leading global automotive component manufacturers such as Bosch and Continental."SK Keyfoundry to supply power chips to Tesla" was originally created and published by Just Auto, a GlobalData owned brand. The information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

                        "Ford Motor Company's (NYSE: F) stock has been lackluster for long-term investors. If you put $100 in the automaker 10 years ago, you would have a total return of just $128 today (including dividends). Meanwhile, the S&P 500 Index would have given you $339. And let's not even get started on Tesla, which has created more than a few millionaires while Ford's stock was stuck in idle.Can Ford's ambitious electric transition finally turn things around, or should investors finally jump ship? Let's dig deeper to find out what the next half-decade could have in store for the iconic company. The old bull thesis A few years ago, Ford's bull thesis was quite simple. The legacy automaker would quickly shed its lumbering, traditional gas-powered business to focus on electric vehicles (EVs), leveraging its strong brands like the Mustang and F-150 pickup truck to rapidly gain market share. Investors seemed to believe that EVs would inherently boast better profit margins than vehicles with internal combustion engines, and with good reason. Since 2020, Tesla's operating margins have dwarfed Ford's and earned it a much higher valuation. Tesla shares still trade for a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 70, compared to Ford's 6.2. It looked like Ford's aggressive transition to the new technology could unlock significant value, especially when combined with the larger company's robust supply chain and expansive dealership network. The electric dream is fadingWith 72,608 all-electric vehicles sold in 2023, Ford is one of America's largest EV makers. But the underlying assumptions that helped justify the company's ambitious transition are beginning to unravel. For starters, EV competition is rising. And even Tesla is facing pressure, with its operating margin falling from 11.4% to just 5.5% in the first quarter. Ford's problems are even worse. The company's Model E segment (which focuses on consumer EVs) saw revenue decline 84% to $100 million after a 20% decline in sales volume, indicating a stunning reduction in pricing. Image source: Getty Images.According to CNN, Model E lost $132,000 for each of the roughly 10,000 cars it sold in the period, and management expects this segment to lose a total of $5 billion in the full year 2024. The silver lining is that Ford's enterprise-focused EV models (such as the E-Transit vans) are helping pick up the slack in Model E performance. Over the coming years, investors should expect this to become an increasingly important part of its EV business as optics and political incentives continue to push companies and government agencies to greenwash their supply chains. The U.S. Postal Service, for example, ordered 9,250 of Ford's E-Transit vans to be delivered this year. Story continuesWhat will the next five years have in store for Ford?Unfortunately, it doesn't look like electric vehicles will be the magic bullet that unlocks a higher valuation for Ford stock. Instead of boosting margins, the new business looks more likely to put further pressure on the company's bottom line, which means less money left over for investors. And the situation looks unlikely to change over the next five years. Ford helps make up for its stagnant stock price with a dividend, which currently yields 4.85%. But while this is much more than the S&P 500 average of just 1.35%, investors who want an income-focused investment would probably be better off buying government bonds. The five-year Treasury bond currently yields 4.4%, with much less risk.Should you invest $1,000 in Ford Motor Company right now?Before you buy stock in Ford Motor Company, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Ford Motor Company wasn’t one of them.

                        'ford motor company s  nyse  f  stock has been lackluster for long term investors  if you put  100 in the automaker 10 years ago  you would have a total return of just  128 today  including dividends   meanwhile  the s p 500 index would have given you  339  and let s not even get started on tesla  which has created more than a few millionaires while ford s stock was stuck in idle can ford s ambitious electric transition finally turn things around  or should investors finally jump ship  let s dig deeper to find out what the next half decade could have in store for the iconic company  the old bull thesis a few years ago  ford s bull thesis was quite simple  the legacy automaker would quickly shed its lumbering  traditional gas powered business to focus on electric vehicles  evs   leveraging its strong brands like the mustang and f 150 pickup truck to rapidly gain market share  investors seemed to believe that evs would inherently boast better profit margins than vehicles with internal combustion engines  and with good reason  since 2020  tesla s operating margins have dwarfed ford s and earned it a much higher valuation  tesla shares still trade for a forward price to earnings  p e  multiple of 70  compared to ford s 6 2  it looked like ford s aggressive transition to the new technology could unlock significant value  especially when combined with the larger company s robust supply chain and expansive dealership network  the electric dream is fadingwith 72 608 all electric vehicles sold in 2023  ford is one of america s largest ev makers  but the underlying assumptions that helped justify the company s ambitious transition are beginning to unravel  for starters  ev competition is rising  and even tesla is facing pressure  with its operating margin falling from 11 4  to just 5 5  in the first quarter  ford s problems are even worse  the company s model e segment  which focuses on consumer evs  saw revenue decline 84  to  100 million after a 20  decline in sales volume  indicating a stunning reduction in pricing  image source  getty images according to cnn  model e lost  132 000 for each of the roughly 10 000 cars it sold in the period  and management expects this segment to lose a total of  5 billion in the full year 2024  the silver lining is that ford s enterprise focused ev models  such as the e transit vans  are helping pick up the slack in model e performance  over the coming years  investors should expect this to become an increasingly important part of its ev business as optics and political incentives continue to push companies and government agencies to greenwash their supply chains  the u s  postal service  for example  ordered 9 250 of ford s e transit vans to be delivered this year  story continueswhat will the next five years have in store for ford unfortunately  it doesn t look like electric vehicles will be the magic bullet that unlocks a higher valuation for ford stock  instead of boosting margins  the new business looks more likely to put further pressure on the company s bottom line  which means less money left over for investors  and the situation looks unlikely to change over the next five years  ford helps make up for its stagnant stock price with a dividend  which currently yields 4 85   but while this is much more than the s p 500 average of just 1 35   investors who want an income focused investment would probably be better off buying government bonds  the five year treasury bond currently yields 4 4   with much less risk should you invest  1 000 in ford motor company right now before you buy stock in ford motor company  consider this the motley fool stock advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now  and ford motor company wasn t one of them  the 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years consider when nvidia made this list on april 15  2005    if you invested  1 000 at the time of our recommendation  you d have  635 982  stock advisor provides investors with an easy to follow blueprint for success  including guidance on building a portfolio  regular updates from analysts  and two new stock picks each month  the stock advisor service has more than quadrupled the return of s p 500 since 2002  see the 10 stocks   stock advisor returns as of may 13  2024will ebiefung has no position in any of the stocks mentioned  the motley fool has positions in and recommends tesla  the motley fool has a disclosure policy where will ford stock be in 5 years  was originally published by the motley fool',

                        "Even those who don't keep close tabs on Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) are surely familiar with Elon Musk and the commanding position he plays in the company's operations. Musk is also the largest shareholder of Tesla stock.However, that's not to say that there aren't other individuals and institutions with sizable positions in Tesla. Let's take a look at some of the other major investors in Tesla stock.A who's who of Tesla stockholdersWith regard to individual insider investors, the next-largest Tesla shareholder after Elon Musk is his brother Kimbal Musk. While Elon Musk owned about 13% of Tesla stock as of Dec. 31, Kimbal Musk owned 1,608,720 shares, representing approximately 0.05%, as of April 2024. A Tesla board member for the past 20 years, Kimbal Musk also sits on the board of another of his brother's ventures, SpaceX.In terms of institutional owners, Vanguard retains the top spot as the largest owner of Tesla stock, a position that dwarfs Kimbal Musk's ownership stake. Holding 229,805,491 shares of Tesla, the Vanguard Group's position represents more than 7.2% of outstanding Tesla stock. Although it's not as sizable as Vanguard's position, it's worth noting that BlackRock isn't far behind, owning about 5.9% of Tesla's outstanding shares.Is now the time for you to become a shareholder?Since the start of the year, it's the bears that have been behind the wheel, driving the downward movement in Tesla stock. While the S&P 500 has risen more than 11%, shares of Tesla have plummeted about 27%. Although many pessimists think that Tesla's best days are in the rearview mirror, there are plenty of others who believe that the company will be able to transcend the rocky road it's currently traveling and regain its former glory.There are valid arguments to be made by both groups of investors, but whether the stock belongs in your own portfolio requires you to conduct your own due diligence and apprise yourself of the company's potential through a SWOT analysis.Where to invest $1,000 right nowWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

                        "With Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings failing to drive markets the way investors had hoped, Commerce Street Capital CEO Dory Wiley joins Market Domination to share his market outlook and discuss how investors should position themselves within the Big Tech sector.Wiley highlights the importance of Nvidia's earnings: \"Nvidia drives Mag 7, Mag 7 drives the market.\" He acknowledges that Nvidia \"blew it out of the water\" with its results. However, he notes that Big Tech has been \"a weak spot in the market\" despite Nvidia's value proposition.Despite the recent pressure on Big Tech and the \"Magnificent 7,\" Wiley remains optimistic about these stocks' long-term prospects: \"[They] have fundamental reasons to keep growing and to keep driving the markets ... If you under-allocate, you're in big trouble.\"For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination.This post was written by Angel SmithVideo TranscriptNvidia earnings out that's in the rearview mirror but couldn't save the market from a down day overall.We've had some surprisingly hot data over the last two days and that just leads to the conclusion that the fed may actually have to stay higher for longer.Uh What's your first flesh impression of the week?Well, there's a lot there but thanks for having me on.Uh, first of all, yeah, NVIDIA drives Max seven Mac Seven drives the market.So that earnings release was important and of course, they, they blew it through the water that stocks up well, over 200% for the year, 2500% for five years.And if there's been a weak spot in the market, it's been big tech over the last 20 years.Now, used to when I would look at it.I'm a fundamental investor.I'd see Amazon with a five or 6% margin.Didn't make money.I couldn't understand the valuation and arguably I missed the boat e early on.But with NVIDIA, it's easy to look at that from a value standpoint, the company got 50% margin.They run a 90 plus percent return on equity.They're growing like crazy in the pursuit their position in the market is not only super uh uh a first mover advantage in the A I space and accelerated computing, but it's already getting entrenched.And so it's a really amazing stock, but I would say the market's got a little more depth to it than just the video mag seven.Because if you look around, uh at, at all the companies reporting in the first quarter, these companies we had earning supplies here, right?We did well up over over 5% 5.3% in earnings uh expectations when the market was expecting, you know, 3.9%.Story continuesAnd so that was a nice boost to help some of this downside protection.Everybody's worried about amidst some other concerns about rate hikes higher for longer inflation and stuff which we can talk about.Uh dory.I, I want to dig a little bit in on and the mag seven specifically here for just a second because I, I feel like the big question is after the numbers, do people, should people be thinking about adding to NVIDIA if they don't have a position or if they don't have a large position, should they just stay pat?Um And does that extend to the rest of the mag seven as well?Well, it, that's probably the biggest question for not only individuals but institutional investors, right?If you're an index person or you're a large cap manager.Do you have the mag seven allocation to your portfolio?Do you have the NVIDIA allocation?So about a year ago, I started saying, you know, you under allocated your own risk because these stocks have fundamental reasons to keep growing and to keep driving the market and to keep what dominating the, the, the S and P. So if you under allocate, you're in big trouble, I think that still holds, you know, NVIDIA still looks strong.Mi Microsoft still looks strong.And if you want to outperform the market, then you can tactically overweight some of these stocks that you like more and underweight the Teslas and whatnot.But you under allocate mag seven at your own risk.So you kinda have to be in and you have to bite the bullet.And I would get the same question back in November and December when a stock is three or 400 bucks.And I said, you still have to close your eyes, put a little in and then pray that there's a dip of 10 or 20% to shake out some of the euphoria and you can get in then.But I think you got to establish a position and then, and then pray for some dips.The joke I had with my trader was I said, hey, you're supposed to be buying this video on dips.This was a few months ago and he goes, there haven't been any dips.And I said No, the dip is one that only goes up 1%.",

                        "Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk has been breaking barriers, so to speak, in his recent campaign to pass through his $56 billion compensation package. Tesla shareholders are set to vote on this on June 13 after the Delaware Chancery Court struck it down. But Musk isn't the only chief executive seeking enormous executive pay packages.Yahoo Finance Legal Reporter Alexis Keenan explains the current trend of CEOs demanding and receiving large compensation packages, and the year-over-year growth of these packages.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination.This post was written by Luke Carberry Mogan.Video TranscriptWell, on June 13th, Tesla shareholders will have another chance to vote on Ceo Elon Musk's pay package that's been worth as much as $56 billion.The compensation remember was invalidated by Delaware Judge earlier this year, but Musk is not the only company leader who's been pushing compensation packages higher young finances, Alexis Keenan has the details.Hi, Alexis.Hi Julie.So yeah, if you look at CEO pay, it's on the rise.If you look at the Russell 3000 kind of a broad look at CEO awards in the five year period that came right after that must pay package.So from 2018 to 2022 you have among all CEO S in that index up 6.2%.If you look at CEO S that are running companies with revenues exceeding 20 billion, that's more modest 2.4%.But then the big whopping number are for those CEO S and companies with that less than 50 million an annual revenue mark at 19.3%.So how do you put this all in perspective with that must pay package given that he didn't have really these annual awards yet that just that big 2018 $56 billion package as we now know in hindsight.So if you try to compare, you can look at, let's say the highest paid CEO S of 2023.In that case, Broadcom's Hot Tan, he was awarded 100 and $62 million mostly in stock awards that vested uh over five years.Um You have then Palo Altos Networks, Ns Aurora coming in second place, awarded 100 and $51 million plus some per uh performance based stock options there.Uh You could also take a look at CEO pay at the largest US companies.So let's say companies that have revenues for annual revenues exceeding a billion dollars there.You have the median in 2022 up 7.7% over the prior year, you jump over to 2023 up 11.4% over 2022.So under Musk's deal that had a 10 year period.So he had to try to meet these performance goals that are in that package over 10 years.Now, that was pairing revenue marks, profit marks market cap requirements, all these milestones.Story continuesAnd if you hit them, it opened up these 12 different buckets of stock options and that is worth approximately give or take about 1% of Te Tesla's equity uh but had that been spread over 10 years, let's say it.And we know it's not because you already achieved these benchmarks that would still be approximately $5.6 billion a year.So you can kind of put that up against those other numbers that I showed you for those annual awards to try to get some sense of it.Uh So then you have on top of that Musk owning approximately 22% of the company, all things considered his pay.If you break it down on that 10 year basis, still really in the stratosphere.",

                        "Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) is arguably one of the most successful companies in the last decade, turning around its business from the brink of bankruptcy to become one of the most-profitable car manufacturers globally.Despite its huge success, the company is not resting on its laurels. It's now aiming at the top position in the auto industry by selling 20 million electric cars in 2030, which is around twice the sales volume of Toyota, the biggest automaker in the world.To become the cost leader in the industryTesla has been firing on all cylinders in the last few years by delivering mind-blowing growth as the world moves from internal combustion engines to electric vehicles (EVs). The top dog delivered 71% and 51% revenue growth in 2021 and 2022, respectively.However, investors who were used to Tesla's hyper-growth performance were disappointed with the material decline in growth rates to 19 % in 2023. Worse, revenue fell 9% in the first quarter of 2024. Similarly, operating profits declined 56% year-over-year.While nobody likes a weakening financial performance, investors might want to look beyond these headline numbers to focus on Tesla's strategic decision to become the lowest-cost producer. And here's how it works.Tesla began by reducing the sales prices of its vehicles globally in 2023 to make it more affordable to own Tesla cars. An improvement in affordability would encourage new consumers (especially those who previously avoided Tesla cars due to pricing reasons) to buy its vehicles, which would lead to higher sales volume. With a higher sales volume, Tesla would have the economies of scale to reduce its unit-production cost, giving it even more leverage to lower its selling price further.While it's early days, there are signs that this strategy is gaining steam. For instance, Tesla's 2023 vehicle deliveries grew by 38%, far ahead of its automotive-revenue growth of 15%. Besides, 2023 volume growth almost kept up with that of 2022 (40% growth).Tesla also confirmed that its cost-efficiency program has resulted in a lower cost of goods sold per vehicle in the last few quarters , and it continues to find ways to save on costs. For example, it recently announced a massive 10% staff layoff, with more cuts expected. In other words, Tesla aims to create a virtuous cycle of lower sales price, unit cost, and ultimately higher sales volume as it works toward its vision of selling 20 million cars.Still, investors should bear in mind that to reach the 20 million target is not going to be an easy feat, considering that Tesla delivered 1.8 million cars in 2023.It will need enormous capital and solid execution to reach that target. Moreover, the journey will likely be bumpy than smooth sailing. For instance, deliveries fell 9% in the first quarter of 2024 as a result of unscheduled downtime caused by the Red Sea conflict and an arson attack at Gigafactory Berlin.To launch new affordable car models in 2025While price and cost reduction would get Tesla started on its journey, the company must do more than that to reach its long-term goal. Fortunately, it has another critical strategy in place, which is to launch new affordable car models .This strategy offers plenty of benefits. It gives consumers more choices, making it easier to find what best fits their needs. Since these new models might tilt toward a more affordable pricing level, they would open up a new market segment for the company.Another significant benefit of this move is reducing the  price cuts of the existing models to spur volume growth since Tesla can now address different customer segments with separate models. Doing this would help reduce the impact of falling margins on the company. For perspective, operating margin has fallen from 16.8% in 2022 to 9.2% in 2023 .Moreover, while the downside to launching these new models would be a substantial upfront capital investment -- for retooling the factory, for product-development costs, etc. -- it could result in a lower unit-production cost since these new models would be produced with more advanced materials, tools, and operational technologies.Still, investors should monitor potential risks such as capex-cost overrun, failed product launches, etc. The opportunity might be huge, but the company must execute well to create long-term shareholder value.What it means for investors?Tesla's recent strategic moves to become a low-cost producer and launch new affordable models will not be easy.Some of these decisions could lead to materially higher capital investment and lower margins in the short term. So, there could be enormous short-term pain before the company can reap the benefits.However, if it executes well, Tesla will gain enormous competitive advantage (economies of scale), leading to higher (and more sustainable) profits over the long run.Investors should prepare themselves for a bumpy ride ahead.Where to invest $1,000 right nowWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

                        "Indonesian president Joko Widodo's years-long wooing on Elon Musk may have finally paid off. The Southeast Asian leader, commonly known as Jokowi, openly courted the Tesla CEO for investment in the country's fledgling EV sector, even making a personal visit to see the billionaire in Texas in 2022.Musk has now made his first visit to Indonesia after Jokowi's charm offensive. The billionaire traveled to the resort island of Bali over the weekend—not for Tesla, but for one of his other companies: SpaceX. On Sunday, Musk inaugurated SpaceX's Starlink satellite internet service in Indonesia, saying he was \"excited to bring connectivity to places that have low connectivity.\"Starlink received a license to operate in Indonesia earlier this month. It's the third Southeast Asian country to approve the satellite internet service, following the Philippines in 2022 and Malaysia last year.Establishing internet connectivity in remote areas of Indonesia, the world's largest archipelago with around 17,000 islands, is a challenge. More than 20% of Indonesians still lack internet access, according to Indonesia's minister of communication and informatics Budi Arie Setiadi.Going beyond Starlink?On Sunday, Musk said it was \"very likely\" that his other companies would invest in Indonesia, without providing further details.Jokowi has tried for years to get Musk and Tesla to invest in Indonesia, touting the country's nickel industry. Indonesia has the world's largest reserves of nickel, a key material for both stainless steel and some kinds of EV batteries.The Indonesian government banned the export of nickel ore in order to encourage investment in local nickel processing and refining, but so far most of the foreign investment is from Chinese and South Korean companies.Yet Indonesia's nickel bet is risky. EV manufacturers are starting to pivot to batteries that don't use nickel, and electric car sales are slowing down after recent years of booming growth.Jokowi, who will leave office in October, has tried to court foreign investment and move Indonesia up the global value chain since taking office in October 2014. EV makers like China's BYD and Vietnam's VinFast have pledged to build manufacturing facilities in the country.It's not just EV companies thinking about the Southeast Asian country. Microsoft is pledging $1.7 billion in investment towards AI and cloud computing services, as well as provide AI skills training for up to 840,000 Indonesians. Apple CEO Tim Cook also said he will \"look at\" Indonesian manufacturing after a meeting with Jokowi earlier this year.Jokowi has had less success in trying to attract foreign investment for his ambitious plans to move Indonesia's capital from Jakarta to Nusantara, a still-under-construction city on the island of Borneo.

                        'By Nick Carey and Marie MannesLONDON (Reuters) -Tesla is working to appease some European leasing companies after the automaker’s repeated retail price cuts tanked their fleets’ value and its slow service and expensive repairs alienated their corporate customers.The efforts include unofficial discounts on purchases of new cars if they are in stock and efforts to address widespread service, repair and ordering complaints after years in which fleet managers and leasing firms say Tesla has ignored those problems, according to Reuters interviews with nine executives from major leasing and rental-car firms, along with about a dozen corporate fleet managers.Tesla’s retail price cuts aimed to bolster sales in response to softening electric-vehicle demand globally and rising competition, especially from Chinese EV makers such as BYD. But that damaged the bottom lines of its biggest customers in Europe — where fleet purchases represent nearly half of auto sales.Leasing companies buy new cars and arrange leases calculated on how much they believe they can sell them for at the end of the lease. Sudden drops in price undercut those residual values, costing leasing firms money.There’s "nothing worse" than continuously dropping the value of a fleet buyer’s assets, said Richard Knubben, director general of Brussels-based Leaseurope, a leasing- and rental-industry group which represents national groups across 31 countries."Tesla is now actively telling our members: We can give you discounts and compensate you," Knubben said. "But Tesla\'s residuals have dropped so fast, I\'m not sure the discounts they\'re offering are enough."Tesla did not respond to requests for comment.Tesla’s falling resale values and tensions with fleet customers are known but its damage-control campaign to address them has not been previously reported.A top executive at a large European car-leasing firm, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he did not have permission to comment publicly on Tesla, said that, starting in mid-2023, Tesla offered unofficial end-of-quarter discounts on its Model 3 and Model Y by up to 2,000 euros ($2,134) for leasing-company purchases, if those vehicles were in stock.Since late last year, he said, those discounts have been available all the time.Tim Albertsen, CEO of Ayvens — Europe\'s largest auto-leasing company with a fleet of 3.4 million cars, about 10% of which are EVs — said Tesla’s service has improved but its falling resale values have been damaging. "Tesla has understood that and is coming with solutions that help us with that," he said.Albertsen declined to elaborate on what Tesla has done to mitigate Ayvens’ losses on EVs.Arval, the car-leasing unit of BNP Paribas\', is now talking to three Chinese automakers about buying EVs after taking losses tied to declining Tesla values. When Tesla first started cutting prices last year, Arval told the automaker: “You are really shooting yourself in the foot,” said Arval Deputy CEO Bart Beckers.Arval leases about 170,000 EVs as part of its 1.7 million-vehicle fleet, Becker said. He said Tesla is working to fix repair-and-service problems but added the automaker’s “new challengers” — Chinese EV makers — seem to be avoiding Tesla’s mistakes by focusing on maintaining strong resale values for cars.The automaker faces the same resale-value problem with rental-car companies. Hertz has been selling off Teslas in the U.S. market, while German rival Sixt has stopped buying them. Asked about the impact of Tesla’s price cuts, Sixt said lower residual values on EVs from Tesla and other brands reduced its 2023 earnings by 40 million euros ($42.7 million).CRITICAL CUSTOMERSFleet customers are important in any automotive market but especially so in Europe, where firms often lease large numbers of company cars for employees, in part because of associated tax breaks. Leasing and rental-car company purchases comprised 44% of Tesla sales last year in the UK and 15 EU countries, according to market research firm Dataforce.Tesla’s first-quarter fleet sales in those countries fell 2.3% while the market as a whole was up 3.5%. Even as its fleet sales fell, leasing companies’ and rental car firms’ share of Tesla’s business in those markets rose to 49%.Tesla\'s sales and profits are falling globally after a long period of sharp growth. The automaker reported an 8.5% drop in global deliveries during the first quarter, its first decline in four years.The decline in fleet sales in those 16 European countries comes after 57% growth in 2023, over the previous year, according to Dataforce. Tesla posted the same percentage growth for all sales across Europe, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers Association.Until recently, Tesla had a first-mover advantage that meant European corporate customers had few alternatives for EVs to meet internal climate goals or EU emissions targets.That’s changing swiftly. Chinese automakers including BYD are bringing lower-cost electric models to Europe and aggressively courting Tesla\'s corporate customers, according to fleet managers, along with executives from leasing firms. Legacy automakers such as Volkswagen and BMW are also producing increasingly competitive EVs.‘PENT-UP FRUSTRATION’Slow and expensive Tesla service has been another sore point with European leasing companies and their customers, according to Reuters interviews with about a dozen corporate fleet managers. Most declined to be identified because they are actively seeking to resolve problems with Tesla.Its repairs take too long and cost far more than other vehicles, partly because of pricey parts, they say.Even so, Tesla does have satisfied fleet customers.Octopus Electric Vehicles, the car-leasing arm of UK energy firm Octopus Energy, has about 5,000 Teslas among about 15,000 EVs. CEO Fiona Howarth said that Tesla, as an EV pioneer, needed time to figure out service operations and that legacy automakers now face similar challenges with their own EVs. She said Tesla resale values were artificially high during the coronavirus pandemic and needed to come down."We\'ve had a really good working relationship with Tesla," she said.Lorna McAtear, fleet manager at UK energy firm National Grid, described much rockier relations with Tesla. She’s been compiling data on repair costs and found Tesla’s to be triple the industry average.Other problems, McAtear said, include a cumbersome ordering system and cars arriving with defects. For instance, she said, Tesla delivered a number of EVs with warped windshields and declined to fix them under warranty.National Grid has more than 500 Teslas in its company-car fleet of 2,000 vehicles. McAtear said she has planned to propose her company drop Tesla from its fleet unless the problems are addressed. Meanwhile, Tesla’s chief Chinese rival, BYD, is starting to deliver cars to National Grid.McAtear said she pushed for a face-to-face meeting with Tesla representatives in mid-April. During that meeting the automaker promised service improvements and an ordering-system fix, along with additional meetings and a “roadmap” for resolving outstanding problems leaving McAtear feeling like "we finally have customer service."The automaker has been unresponsive in the past, she said: "There have been years of pent-up frustration that fleets can\'t talk to Tesla."($1 = 0.9373 euros)(Reporting By Nick Carey in London, Marie Mannes in Stockholm and Hyunjoo Jin in San Francisco.

Eight of Biden’s top 20 supporters so far this campaign have direct ties to Silicon Valley. Those figures range from Sequoia Capital\'s Michael Moritz, with $7.3 million in donations so far, to former Facebook (META) COO Sheryl Sandberg, who has given more than half a million.The list grows when Biden\'s big supporters supporters in Hollywood are included. DreamWorks co-founder Jeffrey Katzenberg and actor Seth MacFarlane have given more than $1 million each, according to the records.The totals could already be significantly higher, with campaign finance records running on a delay because of disclosure requirements.

                        "Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) has divided Wall Street since it went public in 2010. Its CEO, Elon Musk, had grand ambitions and very few believers when he set out to manufacture and sell electric vehicles (EVs) back then, but he has repeatedly proved the doubters wrong.As a result, Tesla stock has delivered a whopping 15,000%-plus return in the last 14 years. It's a member of the \"Magnificent Seven,\" a prestigious group of the world's largest technology stocks.That membership is under threat, however, because Tesla stock is trading 58% below its all-time high as Musk and his team grapple with softening demand for EVs and an increasingly competitive environment.Wall Street remains split on Tesla's futureDespite all of Tesla's success, Wall Street remains divided on the company's prospects. Its stock trades at $177.46 as of this writing, so keep that in mind when digesting the numbers below.Ark Investment Management, which is run by technology investor Cathie Wood, thinks Tesla stock could soar 1,027% from here to $2,000 per share. On the flip side, GLJ Research thinks the stock could plunge 87% to just $23.53 per share.Ark's target is predicated on Tesla becoming a leader in autonomous driving, whereas GLJ simply believes the company's valuation is way too high right now, and it points to a recent decline in EV sales that could be a sign of things to come. So, who's right?Tesla faces headwinds in its EV businessTesla is coming off a challenging 2023. Despite meeting its delivery target of 1.8 million vehicles, it had to slash prices by more than 25% (on average) to stoke demand. This year is looking even worse because Musk hasn't even offered a delivery forecast, which leaves analysts to estimate the number could come in as low as 2.2 million.That would equal growth of just 22% year over year, which is far below Musk's long-term target of 50% annually. But deliveries shrank 9% during the first quarter, so Tesla is off to a rough start.Tough economic conditions have forced consumers to cut back on spending, and high interest rates have made debt very expensive for those who want to finance a new car. That's hurting demand for EVs in general, which prompted manufacturers like Ford and General Motors to cut billions of dollars of investment from their future production plans.Despite those legacy automakers pulling back, Tesla still faces growing competition from other EV manufacturers. Those based overseas might pose the greatest threat, like China-based BYD, which sells an entry-level EV for just $9,700 in its domestic market. That model could soon make its way into Western markets like the United Kingdom and Europe, which have been happy hunting grounds for Tesla until now.Story continuesTo combat this threat, Tesla recently announced plans to start producing an entry-level EV of its own in 2025. It could sell for as low as $25,000, and while that isn't as cheap as the BYD offering, it should be cheap enough to entice many consumers at the lower end of the market given Tesla's reputation as a premium EV brand.Image source: Tesla.Tesla's long-term success might rest on autonomous drivingMusk recently told investors they should think of Tesla as an artificial intelligence (AI) or robotics company, not a car manufacturer. Ark Investment Management agrees because the basis for its $2,000 price target is the company's full self-driving (FSD) technology.FSD is still in beta mode, and there is no official date for its widespread release. However, it's expected to be available to all Tesla customers eventually on a monthly subscription basis, and Musk has also floated plans to license it to other automakers. On top of that, he wants to build an autonomous ride-hailing network at Tesla (think Uber but without human drivers), so customers can generate revenue from their autonomous vehicles when they aren't using them.But FSD could be most valuable when installed in Tesla's upcoming robotaxi called the Cybercab, which is set to be unveiled in August. These vehicles could be deployed within a ride-hailing network full-time, operating around the clock to generate a revenue stream with a very high profit margin. They could also be sold to other ride-sharing companies like Uber or Lyft.Ark believes Tesla will generate over $1 trillion in revenue by 2027 with $448 billion coming from autonomous ride-hailing and the Cybercab. To be clear, that is extremely ambitious given neither product has even hit the market yet, not to mention it would require Tesla to grow its revenue more than tenfold in the next three years, which seems practically impossible given the slowdown in its core EV business.So, which Wall Street analyst is right?It's difficult to refute GLJ Research's assertion that Tesla is overvalued. Based on the company's trailing-12-month earnings per share of $2.73 and its current stock price of $177.46, it trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 65.0. That's double the 29.5 P/E ratio of the Nasdaq-100 index.Does Tesla stock deserve to trade at twice the average P/E valuation of its peers in the big tech sector given its earnings nearly halved in Q1 2024 because of slowing EV sales and price cuts? It certainly doesn't seem rational, but Tesla has always traded at a premium to the broad market precisely because of the technologies in its pipeline. They have expanded beyond FSD and robotaxis, by the way, to also include humanoid robots.With that said, if Tesla were to trade in line with the P/E ratio of the Nasdaq-100, its stock would have to fall 55% to $80.54.With that in mind, it appears GLJ Research is probably closer to the mark with its price target of $23.53 than Ark is with its target of $2,000. However, I don't think there is any way Tesla plunges 86% from here because it's still a sound business with truckloads of exciting future potential.Still, it's hard to justify buying Tesla stock today. It might be best to wait on the sidelines until we learn more about the low-cost EV and the Cybercab later this year. Those products could dictate the stock's direction for the foreseeable future.Where to invest $1,000 right nowWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

                        "Financial analyst and YouTuber Kevin Paffrath (\"Meet Kevin\") joins Market Domination to discuss Tesla's valuation as CEO Elon Musk touted the company's AI initiatives at Thursday's shareholder meeting.Paffrath believes there is a large difference between what Tesla is going to deliver versus what Elon Musk promises. He states that compared to Toyota (TM), Tesla has been on a downward trend:\"The difference between the two companies is growth. I value Tesla at a PEG ratio [Price/Earnings-to-Growth] of 1.67, assuming we can get about 30% growth once we bottom out from here. Toyota's growing, in some years, it's projected to grow negatively, but more reasonably, it's growing somewhere between 5-6%, which is barely above the rate of inflation. So that's one of the reasons you see the valuation disparity.\"He adds, \"I think you can go short, and people get mad at me for saying this, but it's just a hedge. It's a macro hedge. You go short bitcoin, you could use a fund like BITI (BITI). I'm not affiliated with them. It's a negative one. The reason for that is when risk assets sell off, Tesla goes down... you don't want to short the whole market for a hedge because that's not going to work. You specifically want an offsetting risk hedge.\"For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination.This post was written by Melanie RiehlCatch up on Yahoo Finance's coverage of all things Tesla, Elon Musk, and his pay package saga:EV competitors like Ford, GM are 'scared' of Tesla: Investor'Don't fire Steve Jobs': Tesla analysts react to approval of Elon Musk's pay package'Hold on Tesla and wait,' don't buy right now: StrategistTesla is in 'incredibly enviable' position for real-world AITesla is biggest market bubble in world history: Short sellerDon't bet against Elon Musk: Dan Ives talks $1T Tesla callElon Musk wins Tesla shareholder battle to keep his record-breaking payElon Musk has been integral to Tesla's growth, AI: Cathie WoodMusk's pay battle is not over. Here's why.Video TranscriptWhen you're looking at how this company is valued though, I mean, just to compare it to Toyota just to give one example here.Uh you look at the market cap of Tesla versus a Toyota.Um You know, there is a big gap here, Tesla, uh a bigger market cap.It's the gap has been bigger in the past.Uh The revenue Toyota though is not quite three times but close to three times the margins to your point at Tesla uh on an automotive basis are higher.But, you know, if you're just looking, we, we always call it an EV maker, but if you're just valuing it and even if you're just valuing it as an EV maker, it doesn't seem to account for how the market is valuing it, it has to deliver on all this stuff and it, it doesn't seem to me, I mean, can it be in 2026 or 27 or 29 or whenever the stuff that he's promising is actually gonna happen?Story continuesWell, I, I like to look at sort of what do I think Tesla is going to deliver versus what Elon promises because I think there's a large split between those.Don't get me wrong.I appreciate the optimism of the CEO I would expect that.And you're right, Toyota would have been a much better stock frankly to own for the last three years than Tesla.Tesla has just been on a straight downtrend.And it's very unfortunate the difference between the two companies is growth.I value.Tesla had a peg ratio of 1.67 assuming we can get about 30% growth.Once we bottom out from here, Toyota is growing in some years, it's projected to grow negatively but more reasonably, it's growing somewhere between 5 to 6% which is barely above the rate of inflation.So that's one of the reasons you see the valuation disparity.But it's also one of the reasons you've seen a lot more downside with Tesla because we did have to go through a few negative growth periods.24 is going to be the big one.Now that said, here's how I think someone could hedge themselves, obviously not personalized advice, but I think you can go short and people get mad at me for saying this, but it's just a hedge.It's a macro hedge.You go short Bitcoin, you could use a fund like bit I I'm not affiliated with them as a negative one.The reason for that is when risk assets sell off Tesla goes down.Look at what's happening today, the French sovereign debt crisis, you've got risk assets, selling off when risk as that sell off.Bitcoin goes down as well.But look at NVIDIA, it's up.So you don't want to short the whole market for a hedge because that's not going to work.You specifically want an offsetting risk hedge.And I think Bitcoin is the perfect way to hedge your Tesla position.",

                        "By Stefanno SulaimanDENPASAR, Indonesia (Reuters) -Indonesia's coordinating minister of investment said that Elon Musk will consider an offer to build an electric vehicle battery plant in the country, after the CEO of Tesla met with President Joko Widodo on Monday.Musk was not immediately available for comment after minister Luhut Pandjaitan made his remarks to reporters.Musk and Widodo met in Indonesia's Bali after both attended the World Water Forum on Monday. \"We made an offer, is it possible to build an EV battery plant here, precursor cathode. And he will consider it,\" Luhut told reporters.Luhut said Widodo also asked Musk to consider investing in an AI centre in the Southeast Asian country and for SpaceX to build a launchpad in Biak island in Indonesia's Papua province, an offer the government has made before.Indonesia's government has been trying for years to lure Tesla to build manufacturing plants related to electric vehicles as the government wants to develop its EV sector using the country's rich nickel resources.On Sunday, Musk had launched SpaceX's satellite internet service for the health sector in Indonesia.Starlink was now available commercially, but the government would focus its services first on outer and underdeveloped regions.SpaceX's Starlink, which owns around 60% of the roughly 7,500 satellites orbiting earth, is dominant in the satellite internet sphere.(Reporting by Stefanno Sulaiman in Denpasar and Ananda Teresia in Jakarta; Editing by John Mair)",

                        "On today's episode of Morning Brief, Yahoo Finance's Seana Smith and Madison Mills cover some of the biggest stories as the holiday-shortened trading week gets underway.The major US indexes (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) started Monday's trading session mixed, as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite hold near their record highs achieved last week. As the tech sector continues to push the market to new heights, Evercore ISI has raised its year-end target of the S&P 500 to 6,000, while Goldman Sachs has raised it to 5,600.Miller Tabak Managing Director and Chief Market Strategist Matt Maley says that the market rally signals that \"investors aren't all that confident about anything outside of the AI phenomenon. And we haven't seen the big broadening out of earnings outside of the AI phenomenon.\"Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari has indicated optimism about potential interest rate cuts, stating that one cut in December is \"reasonable.\" However, Wells Fargo Global Investment Strategist Veronica Willis believes that two rate cuts in 2024 are still possible, noting that more economic data showing disinflation would give the Federal Reserve enough \"confidence\" to enact more than one cut.China's housing market continues to struggle as industrial output growth slowed to 5.6% in May, a decline of over 1% from the previous month's figure. Crude oil prices (CL=F, BZ=F) are climbing higher after China also reported weakening demand and oil refinery outputs. Energy Aspects Oil Analyst Christopher Haines explains that China is \"transitioning to more of a consumer-based economy rather than an industrial-based economy... it's trying to decrease energy intensity. So actually, I think you can read [that] demand, or... some of that data that came out today is relatively constructive.\"This post was written by Melanie RiehlVideo TranscriptI'm John Smith alongside a man at the mills.And this is Yahoo.Finance is like to show the morning brief stock futures relatively flat looking mildly mixed.I would say the S and P down about 1/10 of a percent.The dow moving to the downside, the NASDAQ just over to the upside here to kick off the holiday short and trading week.This coming after the S and P 500 NASDAQ closed and record highs last week market now left looking for the next big catalyst.So let's get to it.Three things that you need to know this Monday morning as you prep for the trading day.Yahoo finances, Joser Jared and Rick Newman have more stock futures are taking a breather this morning after the S and P 500 hit four straight record closes last week.Story continuesInvestment banks are getting more bullish on the benchmark index.However, with ever co I I and Goldman Sachs raising their 2024 year end price targets on the S and P 500 Goldman Sachs lifting its targets of 5600 from 5200 driven by stronger earnings growth.Meanwhile, Evercore I SI S Julian Emanuel boosted his year end target on the S and P to 6000 from 4750.Setting a promising path for inflation and momentum surrounding the A I trade plus the great rate debate.Well on Minneapolis fed President Neil Kasha, he's saying on Sunday that it is a reasonable prediction that the FED will wait until December to cut interest rates.This comes after softer than expected inflation that fueled investor optimism around interest rate cuts last week.C cars latest comments reaffirmed the central bank stance that the fed still needs more data before making any decisions on rate cuts.And China's battered property sector woes continue.The country's latest factory output data shows new home prices in roughly 70 major Chinese cities fell in May from the month before.According to the latest report from China's National Bureau of Statistics, the data also showing investment in the housing sector for the first five months of the year fell more than 10% during the last year.Asian markets are falling on the disappointing results.Let's get right to our top story this morning.The S and P 500 coming off another record setting close, rising 1.5% last week closing above 5403 days in a row.Now, Wall Street getting more optimistic about where stocks are heading from here.Evercore I SI and Goldman Sachs both raising the year end forecast for the S and P 500.Josh Schafer joining us.Now with the latest Josh, I was just gonna say you can see the new targets right there on the screen.But really, we have certainly started to see or continue to see this optimism, really sweep Wall Street.Yeah.So we have evercore moving from 4000, 750 to 6000.So Julian Emanuel completely flipped.Right.He had been a little bit in the bear case there and now he's the most bullish strategist that we track Goldman coming up from 52 to 56.And really you started to feel this after the inflation data last week, not everyone necessarily was moving their year end price target.But Emanuel himself highlighted that inflation had been a key part of the bull case for stocks.And if we see inflation coming lower, which we saw in last week's CP I and PP I data that would be good for stocks.Here's the char he highlighted here.You can see CP I and purple.The S and P 500 isn't blue.You'll sort of note as you look at the little lines there.When you see a big tick down in purple, usually the next kick higher comes in white blue, right?So it's been a little bit of a leading indicator for where the market's headed.I think that's rather intuitive given the fed rate cut cycle we're in right now.If inflation is coming down, that is largely good for not just the stock market but probably all of us in general.And the other key thing that has been at work here has been earnings revisions have not been revised down by nearly as much as they normally are.So that's something Goldman Sachs was highlighting and the key driver there is largely big tech.You can see it right there.You're looking at five names that have seen about 38% growth in their, in their earnings estimates.And that's sort of carrying the S and P 500 to not have earnings estimates fall down.We know those estimates usually come lower.And so the big takeaway from a lot of this research was sort of maybe we're starting to accept that the A I trade can take us a little bit higher.Like even if it's just the five stocks that could mean that the market could run higher.Goldman said if we have large cap exceptionalism, they see the S and P 500 closing above 6000.So there's sort of different cases here.But if you have that large cap out performance, people are starting to realize that if that continues, that would be very good for the broad index, how much of this is reliant on what the fed does moving forward?Or because it's kind of like a scoop of CP I data with A I sprinkles.Is it ok?If the fed takes a little bit longer to start cutting.I think so ma there's not a lot of people in these notes saying we believe the fed is going to cut two times this year and that is why the S and P 500 is going to hit 6000.If you think the S and P 500 is gonna rally almost 10% or roughly 10% from where it is right now.You're not that worried about the fed cutting.What you're focused on is inflation is coming down.That means yields are gonna be lower, moving forward.And we've maybe seen the peak in the tenure.That's something that a lot of strategists are highlighting when you look at this inflation data is OK, maybe we're at the peak of rates and that's sort of the key part of it.And then the other chart I wanted to bring up because I thought this was really interesting when we talk about bubbles and sort of the, the concept of this A I trade going longer.Julian Emanuel highlighted how long the S and P 500 in the past has traded above a 20 pe.So right now everyone call stocks expensive, right?Well, when stocks were expensive in the 19 of the late 19 nineties bubble, they traded at that level for over 700 days when they were expensive in the recent 2021 euphoria, they traded at that level for over 600 days right now, it's only been 140 days.And so this is to sort of get to the point that a lot of people have highlighted as we've had.This stocks are expensive conversation for a couple of months.Now, stocks can be expensive for a while.And that should not be a reason that investors don't want to get into the market or want to get out of the market.This is not to say that history is a definite indicator and we're gonna get the 600 days of the S and P 500 trading above a 420 pe but I did think that's a fruitful reminder that just because things are expensive, doesn't mean that we're gonna just fall off a cliff can trade at these levels for a while.And that's why everyone's talking about those earnings estimates, right?It really depends on if we deliver.If those companies deliver the earnings, then maybe we can just afford a high valuation for a lot longer than people thought.That's such an important chart showing that we're basically like 20% of the way in to the longest running previous time period.There's a lot, there's a lot of charts that show us that we are just not at the the 19 nineties.com bubble euphoria.If that's where you think we're headed, there's there's more to come in that aspect, higher for longer, maybe higher, higher, higher evaluations for longer evaluations for longer a great new phrase from Josh Shafer.Josh.Thank you as always for bringing us your great reporting.We really appreciate it.Speaking of the Federal Reserve Minneapolis Fed Reserve President Neil Kashkari, now saying it's reasonable to predict a December rate cut.Kashkari telling CBS has face the nation that the FED is in a good position to take its time and watch the data.Joining us now to discuss, we have Veronica Willis Wells Fargo Investment Institute, Global Investment Strategist Veronica.Thanks so much for being here.So I I know that you still anticipate two cuts for this year.Talk to me about what single piece of data you think the fed would have to see particularly for cash call in December to get moved up a bit to allocate enough time for two cuts.I think it's not gonna be one single data point that the fed is looking at.I think they're gonna be multiple data points between now and the end of the year that would uh give the fed more confidence to potentially do two rate cuts this year instead of the one that they've got penciled in in their latest do plot.There's gonna be updates on inflation if we continue to see inflation moving in the right direction.I think the Feds gonna feel a little bit more confident that they'll be able to cut rates more than once this year.Uh We've got retail sales out this week that I think is going to be really important if uh that trend of slowing consumer spending still holds.We're starting to see the economy soften a little bit but not too much.We start to see inflation come down.We start to see the labor market normalizing, getting a little bit closer to those pre panem levels.I think the fed will get a little bit more confident about um potentially doing two rate cuts this year.Bri when we talk about the prospect here of two rate cuts, what exactly is that going to look like here for equities?Is that going to be the catalyst?Do you think to really keep this momentum that we certainly have seen in the market alive?I think, you know, once the fed starts to cut the market, I think has priced that in.So we've seen a lot of exuberance in the market throughout this year as we've come down from, you know, six or seven rate cut expectations at the beginning of this year down to one or two.the markets really still, you know, felt positive about, you know, the prospect of, you know, any cuts at all.And I think that a lot of that's been priced in.So I don't see a lot more exuberance once the fed starts to actually cut.Um, but there is the potential for the, the market to still remain strong.We're not expecting a major pullback or anything like that.Yeah, we were just talking with our uh markets reporter Josh Schaffer about this and he was mentioning that it's really about the A I trade.I'm curious from your perspective, I know that you trimmed tech to neutral, how do you maintain that perspective?Given that tech is really driving this market even perhaps more than the FED is at this moment.I think, you know, it's key to remember that tech is a huge sector within, if we're just thinking about the S and P 500 so even a neutral allocation, there is a significant waiting.We're kind of cautioning our investors against getting over their skis in that tech exposure because we do believe that the, the A I play is a longer term theme that should be beneficial across multiple sectors.So, you know, thinking in particular of kind of the infrastructure that's needed to maintain A I and as that is adopted broader across various industries, we think that that could actually be beneficial across more than just the tech sector.And so we're wanting to kind of diversify our exposure there.And I guess more specifically where what should investors be keeping in mind when, when, when they are trying to position themselves for that longer term A I play?Is it utilities?Is it energy, where should they be looking right now?We're favorable on energy, industrials and um materials and those three sectors we think are, you know, positioned really well to benefit from the A I trade and the valuations are a lot more attractive than thinking about those more stretched valuations in the tech sector.All right, Veronica Willis Wells Fargo Investment Institute, Global Investment strategist.Thanks so much for hopping on with us this morning.Thank you.Coming up on Yahoo Finance tomorrow.We will bring you an exclusive interview with Federal Reserve.A Bank of Boston President Susan Collins.She will be weighing in on the rate cut trajectory.And also that's coming up in the four o'clock hour tomorrow.Again, uh fed Boston President uh Susan Collins will be joined at Yahoo Finance tomorrow afternoon, 4 p.m. Eastern time.You won't want to miss that.Well, China's housing market still struggling to rebound even after record a stimulus with housing prices declining at a faster pace than initially anticipated industrial output also slowing to 5.6%.That's down from 6.7%.In April.Meantime, industrial production has largely kept the country's growth on track despite its otherwise slowing economy.So again, some concerning signs within this report really underscores what we have seen play out here in China, Mattie over the last several quarters the last several months specifically.And that is that bumpy recovery.And now specifically, I think the most concerning data point out of China here that we did get early this morning was the latest data that they have on the property sector.Some of the weakness there and maybe what ultimately is going to be needed in order to prop up the economy, maybe in the longer term, it's so critical, particularly because the government has already been pushing a lot of stimulus into the housing sector to the tune of $350 billion.That is clearly not helping prop up the housing market which is critical.This is a market that has been in complete disarray over the course of the last couple of years coming out of COVID, we keep talking about when is China going to be in its post pandemic recovery mode?The housing market is a very critical part of that puzzle.And this is important because it's also part of the overall picture when we think about demand for things like iphones coming out of the region for evs the Chinese economy is such a critical part of so many of the companies that we talk about every single day until the consumer there starts to get on better footing.It's gonna be a tough read through to some of those other names.And as a final data point here, they still have a 5% growth target for the consumers in China over the course of this year.So I wouldn't be surprised if we see more stimulus from the PB OC into the housing market in order to get to that 5% of Yeah, exactly.And it's also, it's also important to point out what we saw on the retail side of things too because that there's lots of questions about how much obviously that we can trust some of this data coming out of China.But when you take a look at those retail sales number, retail spending, at least picking up it remains weak when you compare it to some of those past readings that we have gone on and historically speaking.But again, it does point to that mixed data that we are getting out of China.And then again, ultimately, what that bumpy recovery could mean here to us investors as well, even just more broadly speaking about that global perspective.Absolutely.Well, going global here as well, oil prices are higher today.This comes after crude prices saw their first week we gain in about a month.Now downbeat economic data out of China sparking fears that oil demand could falter even further.Joining us for his outlook on the sector, we have Kit Haines energy aspects.Global crude lead K. Thanks so much for being here.As you heard, we were just talking about the demand picture in China continuing to weaken.To what extent do you think that that could drive oil prices moving forward here?I mean, look, I I just saw uh what you uh what you're posting and I I think your focus was there was more on the um industrial output side.But actually, if you, if you do look at the retail side, it has been improving.And one of the things that a lot of people are missing, I think with China is how it's uh transitioning to more of a consumer based economy rather than uh an industrial based economy.You know, it's trying to decrease energy intensity.So actually, I think you can read those demand.Uh all that, some of that data that came out today is relatively constructive.But I think, you know, as we go into like the second half of this year, um is it gonna get any worse?I don't think so.I think we're, we're looking at a good point now for uh global demand heading into the summer.Uh And for China in particular, you know, I think um we have a couple of specific things like heavy rains, uh the fishing ban coming up and that's gonna kind of dampen, that's kind of dampening some of the sentiment around particularly diesel demand at the moment.But I think heading into, uh you know, August September time, uh things are gonna look a lot better.So, uh we're relatively constructive on, on that outlook.So Kate, it does sound like you see a tighter market at least in the near term.So what ultimately is that going to do to prices here over the next couple of months?Look, I, I don't think we're gonna rock it higher, but I think, um you know, just if you look at fundamentals, um we're gonna have higher, higher runs, higher demand going into the summer.And that's, it's kind of a uh a relatively seasonal thing.So I think from where we are right now, we've just been in probably one of the, in the weakest demand point of the year and we pick up into the summer.So, um you know, uh if you look at some of the flight data, some of the travel data, um and this isn't, you know, this isn't just in the U SI think it's in um all parts of the world.Europe's looking pretty good, even China in terms of um uh gasoline demand and uh jet demand is looking very good.So, uh you know, we, we see things picking up um probably moving towards the uh highs that we saw earlier this year, but I don't think beyond that.I think um there's a lot of things in play.Um A L A lot of potential levers that could, could still be pulled if prices do get high such as an spr release that I think Amos Hochstein was talking about yesterday.Well, let's talk about that.According to the ft here, Biden is ready to reopen us oil reserves if gas prices jump, that is of course heading into the election.How much is that potential move from the Biden administration already priced in?Yeah, I mean, look, I think the that announcement kind of uh does go towards capping your upside in prices.I think people are gonna be looking at the opportunity here.Um, you know, your Brent's trading around 83 $83.Yeah, it's probably, you know, 5 $10 of upside there.Um, but I think if we do head into the nineties, that's when people start to kind of look at, um, you know, are we too high and what can we do to try and, um, you know, stem the rally here?So I think that's, that tends to be, uh, that range.I think 80 to $90 most people are relatively happy with it when we go above that.That's, that's when we start to see red flags.Ok. We've seen the market, uh, largely shrug off the geopolitical risk aspect of this.Is this something that you think investors maybe should be paying a bit more attention to and ultimately, how do you see that impacting prices here over the coming months?Yeah, it's a good, it's a good point.And I mean, I think some of the, you know, geopolitical tensions we've seen this year haven't, uh, really sparked the kind of reaction we'd expected to, but I think um, oil investors are getting more savvy to the market after what we saw in 2022 where, uh, you know, the, the sanctions put in place on Russia, a lot of people were expecting us to lose a huge amount of oil and at the end of the day we didn't.So I think what we're seeing now is people reading this market as, um, ok, we're, you know, we're not going to put a risk premium on until we actually see an impact on production.And uh, a lot of the geopolitical risks at the moment aren't impacting production.You know, like the, the houthis are causing disruption with uh shipping and, you know, obviously Israel Gaza is a, a pretty, pretty big thing at the moment.And uh Russia Ukraine of course, but none of it is actually um taking any oil out of the market.So for now, um I think that's, it's priced as, as it should be.All right kid Haines energy aspects, a global crude lead.Thanks so much for joining us here this morning.Thank you.Well, we're just getting started on morning brief coming up.Best Buy and Toll Brothers both getting upgrades from the street.We're going to break down some top trending takers next and stocks hovering near record highs.But can the rally last through the summer?That's quite a lot of question we're going to discuss during our 10 a.m. hour of catalyst and our very own Jennifer Sha Burger is going to bring us an exclusive interview with Boston fed President Susan Collins.That's coming up tomorrow at 4:40 p.m. Eastern time.You won't want to miss that all this and more.You're watching Yahoo Finance Auto that shares moving higher on reports that activist a Starboard value has a $500 million stake in the company.That's according to the Wall Street Journal.Starboard value is reportedly seeking changes within auto desk including a potential board shake up.Now, this is all stemming from what has played out at auto desk here over the last several months, they did have an internal probe regarding some accounting questions into the company.Now, they what that investigation did result in it didn't lead to any changes here to auto desks previously disclosed financial reports, although the company ultimately did remove or did move its CFO into a new position.So now Starboard, the question of, of they at least their issue with what has played out here over the last several weeks or the real issue has been the timing of when Auto Desk did disclose that probe saying that they disclosed it right after a window had closed for board nominations.And now they are pushing here to have that window reopened because they think that maybe they a new board members could potentially help address some of the issues here at audit us.So again, we're seeing auditor shares move higher on this news here today.Starboard value of $500 million day here in Auto desk and now pushing for some changes here in the letter to auto desk executives.Yeah, and this comes as the stock under a little bit of pressure, at least they're down about 3.5% year to date over the past year.Though up nearly 7% it does appear that according to Bloomberg, they reached out and Auto desk said they were confident in their direction, the Starboard letter in an email.But that is just according to Bloomberg reporting there having said that like you mentioned, Sean, I think the critical part here is this investigation that is going to be the key piece of Starboard's argument, at least moving forward here about kind of concerns with the start the software company's performance and how they have handled that accounting probe in particular, that seems to be the sticking point, at least for Starboard here.Well, that's why getting a boost from a bullish call from U BS, the firm upgrading the stock to buy from neutral and raising their price target to $106 from 85.They cited the company's restructuring efforts and new product cycle and interestingly citing the timing here, Shana upcoming appliance upgrades as a potential boon, which is interesting to me given what we've been saying about the struggles of the housing market, but it is still cyclical, right.At some point, your appliances will just start to break and that is a boon for a company like a best buy the analyst, Michael Lasser also saying that this would be about a 22% upside.It should be evident that the company's market share tends to flourish at the earlier stages of a product cycle.But their restructuring efforts could be a boon for the company's earnings moving forward.Shana.Yeah, and this is a stock that over the last year at least up just around 12%.So lots of questions about what exactly consumer demand looks like, how so many of these names similar to best buy are positioned right now.But U Bs at least coming out saying that they really see this potential forthcoming appliance upgrade cycle and they think that is going to be enough here to lift a best buy here from current levels.You can see it at least for today or at least where it closed on Friday closed just above 87 bucks a share.We are seeing a bit of a move to the upside here in early trading on the heels of this call here from U BS.But again, this, this is all surrounding this new product cycle.What exactly they think that that is going to do here for Best Buy and a lot of this just hinges on the consumer.We will get another reading on the consumer tomorrow when we get retail sales.But again, this willingness to spend especially on these larger ticket items.I think a lot of that is still in question given where we are in the economic cycle.All right.Well, Toll brother is also getting a bullish called this morning this time it's from Goldman Sachs, the firm upgrading the stock from sell to neutral.So raising their price target from 100 and 12 bucks a share to 124.Now, their argument is that the company is going to benefit from out performance in new home sales.We have seen many of these home builders outperform here.Many people who are out there are still in the market looking for homes.Existing home market inventory remains extremely low.New home sales are on our new homes are really the almost the only game in town for so many of those who are out there hunting for homes looking to purchase, maybe their new home are looking to move from their current location.So again, many of these home builders getting that boost, seeing that demand and their real issue has been supply need, demand and their ability to do that in a timely fashion.That's really been what has been, uh, coming up on the earnings calls here over the last several quarters.Yeah, and it's interesting.This is another name.We are sensing a little bit of a theme here of a company that's going to benefit from hopes about rate cuts moving forward and the impact that could have on the housing market.I wonder if that is a little bit of the best buy story here as well.The idea that home buyers and potential home buyers might get a little bit of relief as are starting to get priced in as potentially having some cuts this year that is leading to a lot of upward momentum in real estate stocks in general post CP I rally.So perhaps that is playing into this upgrade a little bit as well.All right.Well, we are just minutes away from the opening bell on Wall Street.Keep it right here.Again.You're looking at all the major averages on track to open the trading day in negative territory.The that right at the flat line now, we will be right back.Welcome back to the morning brief on Yahoo Finance.You are taking a look at futures right now.Dow and SB under a bit of pressure.But remember last week, it was a record setting week here for the markets, lots of optimism about the latest readings that we got on inflation and what exactly that could mean for the Feds next move for cutting rates here as we kick off a new trading week here on Wall Street, a shortened holiday trading week.Again, you're seeing that excitement play out the NASDAQ and the New York Stock Exchange here, Matty.But as we take a look at the major averages, we are looking at a bit of a mixed picture here at the open.At least you've got the dow off just about 3/10 of a percent.You also have the S and P off about 1/10 of a percent here.But again, well above that 5400 level all above that record high too.But it's interesting to look at the amount of pressure on the S and P equal weighted index down 7/10 of a percent even more than the broader.That is telling to us about the narrowness, the concentration of this rally, the tech rally and the market cap weighted S and P potentially holding that index up just a little bit.But our very own Jared Bli, he's standing by with a little bit more on the market action today.Jared, what are you watching?Well, thank you, Matty.Since we're already talking about the S and P 500 equal weight, I'm just going to begin there because there's a lot of talk about market concentration.And indeed, we have seen the mega caps and especially NVIDIA and the chip stocks lead this rally higher and a lot of other stocks and sectors have been left behind.But here is a three year chart of the S and P 500 equal weight and what we can see here, it's still holding what was prior resistance.And so just on a technical level, I am not concerned about this market unless 6500 goes in the equal weight at S and P 500 index.Now, I just want to talk about some divergences that have been building up in the market.Here is the NASDAQ versus the Dow over the last month and pretty striking.You can see the NASDAQ is up 6% while the dow is down 4%.And on a year to date chart, you can see both are positive, but the NASDAQ has really just had a much better year of it.And so the argument goes, are we in a situation where breadth is deteriorating and leaving too much of the market behind?I go back to the S and P 500 equal weight.I don't think we're there just yet.We can also take a look at the S and P 500 those two markets equal weight versus market cap.And it's a very similar story.I'm going to just kind of skip over bonds in the dollar by the way, those are up a little bit today.And so that could be weighing on certain parts of the risk market, but here's a sector action and what you will notice is there's only one sector in the green that is XL K up about one third of a percent utilities in real estate leading to the downside, those are interest rate sensitive and sectors.And as we do have uh we do have interest rates heading up today.So that makes a lot of sense confirmation there.Wanna close here with semiconductors, nvidia and Broadcom at record highs, you can see Broadcom up about 3%.So is Taiwan semi and really the chip sector as a whole has just been on fire recently.And so I guess the question now is how long does it take for the rest of the market to catch up or catch down?All right, Jared.Great stuff.Thanks so much.Well, Jared just mentioned it and you're taking a look at it right now.You've got NVIDIA notching a fresh record high this morning.Big Tech has been driving this record setting rally that we have seen play out, especially some of the excitement in the markets last week.Now, the sector accounting for over 61% of the S and P five hundred's gains so far this year here to discuss tech's outsized, impact on markets and much more we wanna bring in Matt Maley.He is Miller Ta Ta uh managing director and equity strategist, Matt.It's great to see you here.So let's talk about that concentration that we saw have seen play out here in the markets.We are initially, we're talking about some concerns, some risk that that might signal here for the broader market.What do you think just about where we are the current valuations and whether or not maybe there is too much worry about that narrow concentration.Well, you know, you never like to see a narrow rally having said that uh you know, this time last year, we had a very similar narrow rally and yet it kept going for another month and a half and it really didn't see a pullback until we got to August.Um But, you know, it, it, one of the things that does tell us is that, you know, investors aren't all that confident about anything outside of the A I uh phenomenon and we haven't seen the big, uh, broadening out of Ernie outside of the A I phenomenon.We have this, you know, the people are making the chips, the picks and the shovels are doing well, but it's not, you know, it's, we're not seeing the end users of these chips really, you know, seeing a big increase in earnings.So that's going to be a big concern.I mean, the the and P weight index that you guys were talking about, it's down four weeks in a row while, while the SNP has been rallying uh quite nicely.So this divergence is something we do need to be concerned about.You know.Uh yes, maybe it does need to fall a little bit further before it creates some problems.But um whenever you see a, a narrow market, especially when it's as incredibly narrow as this one is, uh it does raise some questions.So ma'am, what does that tell us about the 6440 portfolio?And I asked because I'm on the phone with my mom over the weekend talking to her about what should be she should be doing with her retirement funds.And I know you're not gonna give us investment advice, but when you do have that level of concentration, should you be pouring in more doubling down getting in on just tech or should you be hedging your risks a little bit because concentration could go bad really quickly.Yeah.And one of the things right, right now, uh, mat is, is that we have this, this situation where, uh, it's interesting this in the last week or so.So we heard some people talk about, you know, using a barbell strategy, which is something we've heard a lot in the past, but this seems to make a little bit of sense.I mean, these, these companies that are, you know, out performing so well are making money.I mean, NVIDIA, uh it is not an expensive stock if you look at it on a, on a long term basis, but you getting 5% in, in cash right now, which is outperforming, as I mentioned, I mean, you know, the S and P equal weight, uh index of Russell 2000 is down on the year.Uh You know, a lot of this stuff in the middle is not acting very well.So why not have, if you're going to be overweight in those, those and those big caps that are doing so well and are, uh are getting some, some nice earnings, why not have a little bit in cash on the other side, uh for protection if the thing does start to turn down, man, when you take a look at what the fed is going to do next, it's, it's too much influence being placed or too much emphasis, I should say, being placed on the exact timing from of a, of a fed rate cut.And ultimately, we don't get one this year.What's that going to do to investor sentiment, do you think?Well, yeah, that's certainly gonna be, I mean, let's say we went to what, expecting seven rate cuts and down to three.Now we're down to one and, you know, we couldn't even get zero.that would certainly throw a wrench into the works because I mean, let's face it.The market is trading at 22 times, uh, forward earnings for, well, for 2024 and 21 or more than 21 times the next 12 months.So the, you know, so now we have a situation where the markets principle, we don't have ultra low interest rates to kind of justify that big high valuation.So that does create problems.And then the other side, we also have to worry about what happens if they, if they suddenly start to cut rates in a meaningful way.Uh, you know, that, you know, in other words, what reason would they have to cut rates more, uh, more quickly?And that would be, of course, that the economy is slowing down and that's not what we want.Uh, because that there would be a negative impact for earnings and an expensive market.That's not a, that's not a big thing.So we, you know, we're definitely as we move into the summer months, we are, uh, you know, have some concerns out there and that's why I think some, a little bit more cash on hand is not a bad, is not a bad investment idea.How high does that put the bar then for the next earnings cycle?And is that bar so high that at a certain point, these tech companies are not going to be able to keep up with the amount of growth that the street is looking for.That's the big concern.I mean, it is an election year.We know we've got a lot of fiscal uh uh stimulus in, in the marketplace and it's going to be there.It's not like Congress has to pass anything more.They've already passed it a long time ago and the administration back and loaded it.So, so, uh into this year.So we, we, we get some nice uh liquidity but earnings, you know, remember last year, the stock market rallied 25% on zero earnings growth.So, I mean, you know, if, if we're and we're already up, you know, so since the beginning of 2023 we've had a 38 39% rally in the S and P 500 yet their earnings have only grown are expected to grow over the two years.Uh, you know, 23 and 24 12% at some point, we have to get a big increase in se in the second half.We are looking for, you know, a nice increase in 3rd, 3rd quarter or fourth quarter, but it's going to have to be even better than the expectations are right now or, or it's just, I just think this evaluation thing is, is become a problem.Matt le le let's talk about what's going on in the rest of the world here and the impact that that could ultimately have on the US markets and, and investors watching this show, when you take a look at what is playing out right now in France, when you take a look, even from a geopolitical risk perspective, the latest on the war in Israel, uh Israel's war with Hamas, what should investors keep in mind here just in terms of the risk that that could ultimately pose here to the global markets and what that could mean to the US.Yeah, I, you know, II I sea, I just really think that the, the, the situation is the complacency surrounding these uh uh geopolitical risk is, is awfully high.Again, some of that has to do with the, the liquidity in the marketplace and the market keeps going higher.I I can't worry about these things.I mean, let's face it.Uh the, the situation in the Middle East has been going on for 778 months now and it hasn't had an impact.But you know, that issue is not, it stopped escalating.It's only been escalating very gradually, but it keeps escalating.And now we start thinking everything with uh in the north of Israel and Hezbollah and the conflicts there, if this becomes a wider, you know, a wider war and that impacts the stock prices, you know, with the straits of war move, shutting down or something like that.You got a big problem and uh it's, it's, I just worry that and of course, with this thing with France, everybody is saying, don't worry about it, but we've seen what sovereign debt crisis done in the past.So again, with 5% cash, I'm not saying, oh jeez, you should suddenly go to 50% cash or even 20% cash.But you know, it, it gives you a little bit easier to sleep at night when you have some of these things going on over there and you're actually paid to wait and actually paid uh to have a little bit of cash.So raising that level a little bit I think is a good idea, very important for investors to consider.All right, Matt Maley, always great to talk to you.Thanks so much for making the time for us here this morning, Miller Tayback, managing director and equity strategist.Thanks, Matt.Thank you.Well, coming up a deep dive into Tesla's growth story, we are going to talk to one analyst on why he sees sentiment improving for the EV giant in the coming months.You're looking at gains of just about 1% here for Tesla and early market trading.We'll be right back.Tesla shares moving to the upside here of nearly 1.5% after the EV giants shareholder meeting at that meeting.Musk predicted that Tesla's optimist robots could eventually lift the company's market cap to $25 trillion.One of the other catalyst that Wall Street is watching for deeper dive in a Tesla's growth story.We are joined by the AM US auto parts and analyst here.Thank you so much for joining us here.I want to start on what you are anticipating based on what we heard from Musk specifically with regards to new product announcement.Sometimes it's tough to kind of suss out whether or not Musk's approach is necessarily going to prove to come to fruition.What did you make of the teasing out of certain new products to come at that meeting?Absolutely good morning and thank you for having me.Yeah, there is a lot of anticipation for the next round of new products from Tesla.Uh last quarter.They did allude to launching uh more affordable electric vehicles uh off some of the same platforms they have today and leveraging some of the manufacturing capacity they have today and launching these vehicles next year.There are really two things people are looking for in these vehicles.The first of course is the price just given that EVs do need to become more affordable and, and you know, there's some opportunity for growth uh at lower price points.But the second thing that we're particularly looking for is really just the overall design and content of these vehicles.Because the ultimate question I think for investors is going to be that will these vehicles generate the same type of excitement we've seen for other high volume vehicles in the past, such as of course the model three and the model Y if the answer to that question is yes, we do see scope for sentiment to improve as the focus would then turn to these new products driving additional growth uh versus which is really needed just given some of the demand, uh headwinds that both electric vehicles of what we're seeing around the world that a Tesla specifically is, is facing given some of the aging out of their current portfolio.So Todd two follow up questions on that one.What do you think prices should be at or need to be at to really spark that demand?We've been talking a lot about lower prices, but I guess more specifically is there a range that you think is critical for Tesla to get to?And then two, when you talk about the Tesla story specifically and what these new products, what these new uh vehicles need to be equipped with in order to generate that excitement.What do you think needs to be incorporated?In order to see uh that excitement play out in the market.Yeah, there's a lot of technologies but whether it's uh in the interior of the vehicle or, or, or even others uh that, that could just create more of a change, right?When you think about large car companies as they grow, there does need to be different design languages, even different sub brands in those vehicles to really appeal to a wider audience uh around, around the world.Because when you look at different regional tastes and regional consumer preference that they do tend to vary not only by, by country, but even within regions in certain countries, including here in the US.So, you know, we want to see a lot of innovation, maybe different design languages, but really whatever it takes.Of course, Tesla is very good at innovation and very good at product to create a lot of uh incremental excitement and, and price points are are clearly important, but we've been on the view.Uh The price isn't Tesla's number one issue today.We would actually rank just the overall aging of the portfolio as being maybe a bigger issue for the company today than just price alone.So of course, we want to see 30 40,000 and eventually even lower than that.Of course, Tesla's had aspirations to launch a $25,000 ev of course, so we're mindful of the price points.Uh and of course, the price points relative to the content you're getting, it's all ultimately all about the value for dollars.Uh But we really are focus is overall on the content on the design, on the innovation.Um to really undersee whether you know, investors and consumers, of course, can get really excited about new vehicles.Uh that could be very high volume vehicles for the company.So it is a very significant focal point here over the next few months.Itai I wonder if you can talk a little bit about the path to autonomous vehicles.And you sort of mentioned the varying global appetite for a variety of things coming from Tesla to what extent is the kind of bifurcation and interest in being in a full self driving vehicle across countries globally?Sort of a potential headwind for Tesla moving forward.Yeah.No, it really all depends on, on kind of the the different opportunities within how you think about launching autonomous vehicles.So we are very bullish on the opportunity within autonomous vehicles overall lower cost per mile and new business models and the opportunity not only to increase revenue streams, but even to grab revenue streams that exist in the value chain today and bring it kind of back up to that automaker ecosystem.I think autonomous vehicles tend to be um often defined as sort of one business model of the so called urban Robo taxi.But actually there are a lot of different business models in theory that a company could launch Tesla has a couple of very unique advantages in our view.One being that we do think that they could probably launch perhaps the cheapest and lowest cost Robo taxi platform out there, not only from a hardware cost perspective, but also from an operating cost and network cost perspective.And if we're right about that, that could actually lead to potential new opportunities of how to deploy autonomous vehicles.For example, you might not need to deploy the most dense areas.You can actually maybe go to relatively easier areas and then maybe even launch some services on your current ecosystem of, of consumer vehicles and Robo taxi vehicles, things like peer to peer uh vehicle landing, things like uh you know, you order something at nine o'clock at night and the vehicle travels to get it for you at 2 a.m. Y 2 a.m. because you know, the safest autonomous vehicles aren't gonna be the one driving without any uh person in the vehicle uh in, in, in relative times where a few people are out on the road.Uh and the vehicle can kind of bring you those items that you ordered uh in the morning.And so there's a lot of different ecosystem effects.So we think that you can create uh to sell more vehicles, create new revenue streams and ultimately try to supplement uh the consumer fleet with, with Robo Taxi because the number one, you know, fact that we think they have to get right.Uh When they kind of reveal that the Robo Taxi Day uh is of course the cost and then the vehicle itself, but ultimately is how are you going to deploy autonomous vehicles in a way that's first and foremost, safe, but also can lead to additional revenue streams that maybe people aren't really thinking about today.Nata.Before we let you go, if Tesla is in fact able to do all of that, what is the upside then look like for Tesla?Yeah, we're still neutral on the stock.Just give me some near term, you know, fundamental headwinds.We talked about.Uh I think our estimates are still actually below consensus.But if you can turn the story into a the new evs we talked about and B if the company can craft a credible autonomous vehicle deployment plan that leverages their advantages, we think there is scope for sentiment to improve here in the next few months.It's gonna be a very important few months for them uh to kind of try to reshape the narrative given some of the near term headwinds that they're facing Ty Malley.Always great to have you.Thanks so much for joining us here this morning.City's us Autos and auto parts analyst.Thanks so much, Atty.Well, coming up, Disney is back with its blockbuster debut of inside out too with the signals for the summer box office.And how big of a boost this could be here for Disney.We've got that for you.Next, Disney is back at the box office smashing expectations with its new release inside out to bringing in 100 and $55 million domestically.Just in first weekend, the first film since last year's Barbie that's debuted above that $100 million mark.Young Finances, Alexander now has the details for us all.This is a big deal for the box office and finally, a little bit of optimism about people coming back in.Yes big deal for the box office.Also a big deal for Disney that is really struggled with its Pixar films and animated films.The film was the second highest theatrical opening of an animated movie and the first film since Barbie to cross that 100 million mark in its debut and we have seen Pixar really struggle when it comes to the relevancy at the box office when it comes to getting those butts and seats.But recently, there's been a strategy shift from Pixar when it comes to the types of films that they not only that they're producing, but how many films they plan to show in theaters?We've heard Disney Ceo I preached this quality over quantity strategy and that's echo throughout multiple facets of this business.And when it comes to Pixar, their strategy is going to be Sequels, sequel, Sequels and less movies than previous.So three movies every two years with every other film being either a sequel or a spin off.Now, this comes as it still continues to face pretty stiff competition from movie producers like NBC Universal and Sony.So the point here is to drive home this built in audience that if you continue to create movies that have that loyal fan base up to a point, people will continue to come out.So of course, we, we've seen the strategy fail before, I mean light year that was a sequel in 2022 that really did not perform well at all.So they need to pick and choose what types of movies they wanna recreate for spinoffs and Sequels.And also a big emphasis on the box office.Not as much Disney plus because that was a point of confusion as well.Yeah, exactly.And it is interesting just how many people went out and saw inside out too and really the excitement that they were able to build surrounding this release.So Ali it looks like that's good news here, at least for Disney.I also want to talk about a headline that came out over the weekend in regards to Deadpool being released in China because this could also be a big break for Disney potentially as well.Yeah.And look the China relationship with the US when it comes to films, it's been a bit strained.We saw Top Gun Maverick, it was not approved to be released in China, which was a big surprise.Considering those big action films to do well in the country.But Deadpool Two has been restricted.The first Deadpool movie was barred in the country when it was released in 2016.Then they allowed a PG 13 version of 2018 Deadpool Two.And now we have this approval here.So, so this could be a big boon when we think about the opportunity for international exposure, the opportunity to bring some of those more overseas dollars to these films, especially at a time when in the US, we're seeing a bit of a pull back when it comes to the types of movies that people and want to see in the theater.Although I do expect that the Deadpool franchise is, is one that often gets the people going when it comes to going to that theater, you wanna be with other people, you wanna cheer and, and laugh at some of that as a loyal fan base and we'll see how exactly it does and what the reception is like there.Right?Ali.Great stuff.Thanks.Well, coming up, can the markets rally?Keep going?We're gonna dive into the catalyst behind the stock markets, climb higher.What it's going to take to continue that march to the upside.We've got that for you next on the catalyst.",

setting a promising path for inflation and momentum surrounding the a i trade plus the great rate debate well on minneapolis fed president neil kasha  he s saying on sunday that it is a reasonable prediction that the fed will wait until december to cut interest rates this comes after softer than expected inflation that fueled investor optimism around interest rate cuts last week c cars latest comments reaffirmed the central bank stance that the fed still needs more data before making any decisions on rate cuts and china s battered property sector woes continue the country s latest factory output data shows new home prices in roughly 70 major chinese cities fell in may from the month before according to the latest report from china s national bureau of statistics  the data also showing investment in the housing sector for the first five months of the year fell more than 10  during the last year asian markets are falling on the disappointing results let s get right to our top story this morning the s and p 500 coming off another record setting close  rising 1 5  last week closing above 5403 days in a row now  wall street getting more optimistic about where stocks are heading from here evercore i si and goldman sachs both raising the year end forecast for the s and p 500 josh schafer joining us now with the latest josh  i was just gonna say you can see the new targets right there on the screen but really  we have certainly started to see or continue to see this optimism  really sweep wall street yeah so we have evercore moving from 4000  750 to 6000 so julian emanuel completely flipped right he had been a little bit in the bear case there and now he s the most bullish strategist that we track goldman coming up from 52 to 56 and really you started to feel this after the inflation data last week  not everyone necessarily was moving their year end price target but emanuel himself highlighted that inflation had been a key part of the bull case for stocks and if we see inflation coming lower  which we saw in last week s cp i and pp i data that would be good for stocks here s the char he highlighted here you can see cp i and purple the s and p 500 isn t blue you ll sort of note as you look at the little lines there when you see a big tick down in purple  usually the next kick higher comes in white blue  right so it s been a little bit of a leading indicator for where the market s headed i think that s rather intuitive given the fed rate cut cycle we re in right now if inflation is coming down  that is largely good for not just the stock market but probably all of us in general and the other key thing that has been at work here has been earnings revisions have not been revised down by nearly as much as they normally are so that s something goldman sachs was highlighting and the key driver there is largely big tech you can see it right there you re looking at five names that have seen about 38  growth in their  in their earnings estimates and that s sort of carrying the s and p 500 to not have earnings estimates fall down we know those estimates usually come lower and so the big takeaway from a lot of this research was sort of maybe we re starting to accept that the a i trade can take us a little bit higher like even if it s just the five stocks that could mean that the market could run higher goldman said if we have large cap exceptionalism  they see the s and p 500 closing above 6000 so there s sort of different cases here but if you have that large cap out performance  people are starting to realize that if that continues  that would be very good for the broad index  how much of this is reliant on what the fed does moving forward or because it s kind of like a scoop of cp i data with a i sprinkles is it ok if the fed takes a little bit longer to start cutting i think so ma there s not a lot of people in these notes saying we believe the fed is going to cut two times this year and that is why the s and p 500 is going to hit 6000 if you think the s and p 500 is gonna rally almost 10  or roughly 10  from where it is right now you re not that worried about the fed cutting what you re focused on is inflation is coming down that means yields are gonna be lower  moving forward and we ve maybe seen the peak in the tenure that s something that a lot of strategists are highlighting when you look at this inflation data is ok  maybe we re at the peak of rates and that s sort of the key part of it and then the other chart i wanted to bring up because i thought this was really interesting when we talk about bubbles and sort of the  the concept of this a i trade going longer julian emanuel highlighted how long the s and p 500 in the past has traded above a 20 pe so right now everyone call stocks expensive  right well  when stocks were expensive in the 19 of the late 19 nineties bubble  they traded at that level for over 700 days when they were expensive in the recent 2021 euphoria  they traded at that level for over 600 days right now  it s only been 140 days and so this is to sort of get to the point that a lot of people have highlighted as we ve had this stocks are expensive conversation for a couple of months now  stocks can be expensive for a while and that should not be a reason that investors don t want to get into the market or want to get out of the market this is not to say that history is a definite indicator and we re gonna get the 600 days of the s and p 500 trading above a 420 pe but i did think that s a fruitful reminder that just because things are expensive  doesn t mean that we re gonna just fall off a cliff can trade at these levels for a while and that s why everyone s talking about those earnings estimates  right it really depends on if we deliver if those companies deliver the earnings  then maybe we can just afford a high valuation for a lot longer than people thought that s such an important chart showing that we re basically like 20  of the way in to the longest running previous time period there s a lot  there s a lot of charts that show us that we are just not at the the 19 nineties com bubble euphoria if that s where you think we re headed  there s there s more to come in that aspect  higher for longer  maybe higher  higher  higher evaluations for longer evaluations for longer a great new phrase from josh shafer josh thank you as always for bringing us your great reporting we really appreciate it speaking of the federal reserve minneapolis fed reserve president neil kashkari  now saying it s reasonable to predict a december rate cut kashkari telling cbs has face the nation that the fed is in a good position to take its time and watch the data joining us now to discuss  we have veronica willis wells fargo investment institute  global investment strategist veronica thanks so much for being here so i i know that you still anticipate two cuts for this year talk to me about what single piece of data you think the fed would have to see particularly for cash call in december to get moved up a bit to allocate enough time for two cuts i think it s not gonna be one single data point that the fed is looking at i think they re gonna be multiple data points between now and the end of the year that would uh give the fed more confidence to potentially do two rate cuts this year instead of the one that they ve got penciled in in their latest do plot there s gonna be updates on inflation if we continue to see inflation moving in the right direction i think the feds gonna feel a little bit more confident that they ll be able to cut rates more than once this year uh we ve got retail sales out this week that i think is going to be really important if uh that trend of slowing consumer spending still holds we re starting to see the economy soften a little bit but not too much we start to see inflation come down we start to see the labor market normalizing  getting a little bit closer to those pre panem levels i think the fed will get a little bit more confident about um potentially doing two rate cuts this year bri when we talk about the prospect here of two rate cuts  what exactly is that going to look like here for equities is that going to be the catalyst do you think to really keep this momentum that we certainly have seen in the market alive i think  you know  once the fed starts to cut the market  i think has priced that in so we ve seen a lot of exuberance in the market throughout this year as we ve come down from  you know  six or seven rate cut expectations at the beginning of this year down to one or two the markets really still  you know  felt positive about  you know  the prospect of  you know  any cuts at all and i think that a lot of that s been priced in so i don t see a lot more exuberance once the fed starts to actually cut um  but there is the potential for the  the market to still remain strong we re not expecting a major pullback or anything like that yeah  we were just talking with our uh markets reporter josh schaffer about this and he was mentioning that it s really about the a i trade i m curious from your perspective  i know that you trimmed tech to neutral  how do you maintain that perspective given that tech is really driving this market even perhaps more than the fed is at this moment i think  you know  it s key to remember that tech is a huge sector within  if we re just thinking about the s and p 500 so even a neutral allocation  there is a significant waiting we re kind of cautioning our investors against getting over their skis in that tech exposure because we do believe that the  the a i play is a longer term theme that should be beneficial across multiple sectors so  you know  thinking in particular of kind of the infrastructure that s needed to maintain a i and as that is adopted broader across various industries  we think that that could actually be beneficial across more than just the tech sector and so we re wanting to kind of diversify our exposure there and i guess more specifically where what should investors be keeping in mind when  when  when they are trying to position themselves for that longer term a i play is it utilities is it energy  where should they be looking right now we re favorable on energy  industrials and um materials and those three sectors we think are  you know  positioned really well to benefit from the a i trade and the valuations are a lot more attractive than thinking about those more stretched valuations in the tech sector all right  veronica willis wells fargo investment institute  global investment strategist thanks so much for hopping on with us this morning thank you coming up on yahoo finance tomorrow we will bring you an exclusive interview with federal reserve a bank of boston president susan collins she will be weighing in on the rate cut trajectory and also that s coming up in the four o clock hour tomorrow again  uh fed boston president uh susan collins will be joined at yahoo finance tomorrow afternoon  4 p m  eastern time you won t want to miss that well  china s housing market still struggling to rebound even after record a stimulus with housing prices declining at a faster pace than initially anticipated industrial output also slowing to 5 6  that s down from 6 7  in april meantime  industrial production has largely kept the country s growth on track despite its otherwise slowing economy so again  some concerning signs within this report really underscores what we have seen play out here in china  mattie over the last several quarters the last several months specifically and that is that bumpy recovery and now specifically  i think the most concerning data point out of china here that we did get early this morning was the latest data that they have on the property sector some of the weakness there and maybe what ultimately is going to be needed in order to prop up the economy  maybe in the longer term  it s so critical  particularly because the government has already been pushing a lot of stimulus into the housing sector to the tune of  350 billion that is clearly not helping prop up the housing market which is critical this is a market that has been in complete disarray over the course of the last couple of years coming out of covid  we keep talking about when is china going to be in its post pandemic recovery mode the housing market is a very critical part of that puzzle and this is important because it s also part of the overall picture when we think about demand for things like iphones coming out of the region for evs the chinese economy is such a critical part of so many of the companies that we talk about every single day until the consumer there starts to get on better footing it s gonna be a tough read through to some of those other names and as a final data point here  they still have a 5  growth target for the consumers in china over the course of this year so i wouldn t be surprised if we see more stimulus from the pb oc into the housing market in order to get to that 5  of yeah  exactly and it s also  it s also important to point out what we saw on the retail side of things too because that there s lots of questions about how much obviously that we can trust some of this data coming out of china but when you take a look at those retail sales number  retail spending  at least picking up it remains weak when you compare it to some of those past readings that we have gone on and historically speaking but again  it does point to that mixed data that we are getting out of china and then again  ultimately  what that bumpy recovery could mean here to us investors as well  even just more broadly speaking about that global perspective absolutely well  going global here as well  oil prices are higher today this comes after crude prices saw their first week we gain in about a month now downbeat economic data out of china sparking fears that oil demand could falter even further joining us for his outlook on the sector  we have kit haines energy aspects global crude lead k  thanks so much for being here as you heard  we were just talking about the demand picture in china continuing to weaken to what extent do you think that that could drive oil prices moving forward here i mean  look  i i just saw uh what you uh what you re posting and i i think your focus was there was more on the um industrial output side but actually  if you  if you do look at the retail side  it has been improving and one of the things that a lot of people are missing  i think with china is how it s uh transitioning to more of a consumer based economy rather than uh an industrial based economy you know  it s trying to decrease energy intensity so actually  i think you can read those demand uh all that  some of that data that came out today is relatively constructive but i think  you know  as we go into like the second half of this year  um is it gonna get any worse i don t think so i think we re  we re looking at a good point now for uh global demand heading into the summer uh and for china in particular  you know  i think um we have a couple of specific things like heavy rains  uh the fishing ban coming up and that s gonna kind of dampen  that s kind of dampening some of the sentiment around particularly diesel demand at the moment but i think heading into  uh you know  august september time  uh things are gonna look a lot better so  uh we re relatively constructive on  on that outlook so kate  it does sound like you see a tighter market at least in the near term so what ultimately is that going to do to prices here over the next couple of months look  i  i don t think we re gonna rock it higher  but i think  um you know  just if you look at fundamentals  um we re gonna have higher  higher runs  higher demand going into the summer and that s  it s kind of a uh a relatively seasonal thing so i think from where we are right now  we ve just been in probably one of the  in the weakest demand point of the year and we pick up into the summer so  um you know  uh if you look at some of the flight data  some of the travel data  um and this isn t  you know  this isn t just in the u si think it s in um all parts of the world europe s looking pretty good  even china in terms of um uh gasoline demand and uh jet demand is looking very good so  uh you know  we  we see things picking up um probably moving towards the uh highs that we saw earlier this year  but i don t think beyond that i think um there s a lot of things in play um a l a lot of potential levers that could  could still be pulled if prices do get high such as an spr release that i think amos hochstein was talking about yesterday well  let s talk about that according to the ft here  biden is ready to reopen us oil reserves if gas prices jump  that is of course heading into the election how much is that potential move from the biden administration already priced in yeah  i mean  look  i think the that announcement kind of uh does go towards capping your upside in prices i think people are gonna be looking at the opportunity here um  you know  your brent s trading around 83  83 yeah  it s probably  you know  5  10 of upside there um  but i think if we do head into the nineties  that s when people start to kind of look at  um  you know  are we too high and what can we do to try and  um  you know  stem the rally here so i think that s  that tends to be  uh  that range i think 80 to  90 most people are relatively happy with it when we go above that that s  that s when we start to see red flags ok  we ve seen the market  uh  largely shrug off the geopolitical risk aspect of this is this something that you think investors maybe should be paying a bit more attention to and ultimately  how do you see that impacting prices here over the coming months yeah  it s a good  it s a good point and i mean  i think some of the  you know  geopolitical tensions we ve seen this year haven t  uh  really sparked the kind of reaction we d expected to  but i think um  oil investors are getting more savvy to the market after what we saw in 2022 where  uh  you know  the  the sanctions put in place on russia  a lot of people were expecting us to lose a huge amount of oil and at the end of the day we didn t so i think what we re seeing now is people reading this market as  um  ok  we re  you know  we re not going to put a risk premium on until we actually see an impact on production and uh  a lot of the geopolitical risks at the moment aren t impacting production you know  like the  the houthis are causing disruption with uh shipping and  you know  obviously israel gaza is a  a pretty  pretty big thing at the moment and uh russia ukraine of course  but none of it is actually um taking any oil out of the market so for now  um i think that s  it s priced as  as it should be all right kid haines energy aspects  a global crude lead thanks so much for joining us here this morning thank you well  we re just getting started on morning brief coming up best buy and toll brothers both getting upgrades from the street we re going to break down some top trending takers next and stocks hovering near record highs but can the rally last through the summer that s quite a lot of question we re going to discuss during our 10 a m  hour of catalyst and our very own jennifer sha burger is going to bring us an exclusive interview with boston fed president susan collins that s coming up tomorrow at 4 40 p m  eastern time you won t want to miss that all this and more you re watching yahoo finance auto that shares moving higher on reports that activist a starboard value has a  500 million stake in the company that s according to the wall street journal starboard value is reportedly seeking changes within auto desk including a potential board shake up now  this is all stemming from what has played out at auto desk here over the last several months  they did have an internal probe regarding some accounting questions into the company now  they what that investigation did result in it didn t lead to any changes here to auto desks previously disclosed financial reports  although the company ultimately did remove or did move its cfo into a new position so now starboard  the question of  of they at least their issue with what has played out here over the last several weeks or the real issue has been the timing of when auto desk did disclose that probe saying that they disclosed it right after a window had closed for board nominations and now they are pushing here to have that window reopened because they think that maybe they a new board members could potentially help address some of the issues here at audit us so again  we re seeing auditor shares move higher on this news here today starboard value of  500 million day here in auto desk and now pushing for some changes here in the letter to auto desk executives yeah  and this comes as the stock under a little bit of pressure  at least they re down about 3 5  year to date over the past year though up nearly 7  it does appear that according to bloomberg  they reached out and auto desk said they were confident in their direction  the starboard letter in an email but that is just according to bloomberg reporting there having said that like you mentioned  sean  i think the critical part here is this investigation that is going to be the key piece of starboard s argument  at least moving forward here about kind of concerns with the start the software company s performance and how they have handled that accounting probe in particular  that seems to be the sticking point  at least for starboard here well  that s why getting a boost from a bullish call from u bs  the firm upgrading the stock to buy from neutral and raising their price target to  106 from 85 they cited the company s restructuring efforts and new product cycle and interestingly citing the timing here  shana upcoming appliance upgrades as a potential boon  which is interesting to me given what we ve been saying about the struggles of the housing market  but it is still cyclical  right at some point  your appliances will just start to break and that is a boon for a company like a best buy the analyst  michael lasser also saying that this would be about a 22  upside it should be evident that the company s market share tends to flourish at the earlier stages of a product cycle but their restructuring efforts could be a boon for the company s earnings moving forward shana yeah  and this is a stock that over the last year at least up just around 12  so lots of questions about what exactly consumer demand looks like  how so many of these names similar to best buy are positioned right now but u bs at least coming out saying that they really see this potential forthcoming appliance upgrade cycle and they think that is going to be enough here to lift a best buy here from current levels you can see it at least for today or at least where it closed on friday closed just above 87 bucks a share we are seeing a bit of a move to the upside here in early trading on the heels of this call here from u bs but again  this  this is all surrounding this new product cycle what exactly they think that that is going to do here for best buy and a lot of this just hinges on the consumer we will get another reading on the consumer tomorrow when we get retail sales but again  this willingness to spend especially on these larger ticket items i think a lot of that is still in question given where we are in the economic cycle all right well  toll brother is also getting a bullish called this morning this time it s from goldman sachs  the firm upgrading the stock from sell to neutral so raising their price target from 100 and 12 bucks a share to 124 now  their argument is that the company is going to benefit from out performance in new home sales we have seen many of these home builders outperform here many people who are out there are still in the market looking for homes existing home market inventory remains extremely low new home sales are on our new homes are really the almost the only game in town for so many of those who are out there hunting for homes looking to purchase  maybe their new home are looking to move from their current location so again  many of these home builders getting that boost  seeing that demand and their real issue has been supply need  demand and their ability to do that in a timely fashion that s really been what has been  uh  coming up on the earnings calls here over the last several quarters yeah  and it s interesting this is another name we are sensing a little bit of a theme here of a company that s going to benefit from hopes about rate cuts moving forward and the impact that could have on the housing market i wonder if that is a little bit of the best buy story here as well the idea that home buyers and potential home buyers might get a little bit of relief as are starting to get priced in as potentially having some cuts this year that is leading to a lot of upward momentum in real estate stocks in general post cp i rally so perhaps that is playing into this upgrade a little bit as well all right well  we are just minutes away from the opening bell on wall street keep it right here again you re looking at all the major averages on track to open the trading day in negative territory the that right at the flat line now  we will be right back welcome back to the morning brief on yahoo finance you are taking a look at futures right now dow and sb under a bit of pressure but remember last week  it was a record setting week here for the markets  lots of optimism about the latest readings that we got on inflation and what exactly that could mean for the feds next move for cutting rates here as we kick off a new trading week here on wall street  a shortened holiday trading week again  you re seeing that excitement play out the nasdaq and the new york stock exchange here  matty but as we take a look at the major averages  we are looking at a bit of a mixed picture here at the open at least you ve got the dow off just about 3 10 of a percent you also have the s and p off about 1 10 of a percent here but again  well above that 5400 level all above that record high too but it s interesting to look at the amount of pressure on the s and p equal weighted index down 7 10 of a percent even more than the broader that is telling to us about the narrowness  the concentration of this rally  the tech rally and the market cap weighted s and p potentially holding that index up just a little bit but our very own jared bli  he s standing by with a little bit more on the market action today jared  what are you watching well  thank you  matty since we re already talking about the s and p 500 equal weight  i m just going to begin there because there s a lot of talk about market concentration and indeed  we have seen the mega caps and especially nvidia and the chip stocks lead this rally higher and a lot of other stocks and sectors have been left behind but here is a three year chart of the s and p 500 equal weight and what we can see here  it s still holding what was prior resistance and so just on a technical level  i am not concerned about this market unless 6500 goes in the equal weight at s and p 500 index now  i just want to talk about some divergences that have been building up in the market here is the nasdaq versus the dow over the last month and pretty striking you can see the nasdaq is up 6  while the dow is down 4  and on a year to date chart  you can see both are positive  but the nasdaq has really just had a much better year of it and so the argument goes  are we in a situation where breadth is deteriorating and leaving too much of the market behind i go back to the s and p 500 equal weight i don t think we re there just yet we can also take a look at the s and p 500 those two markets equal weight versus market cap and it s a very similar story i m going to just kind of skip over bonds in the dollar by the way  those are up a little bit today and so that could be weighing on certain parts of the risk market  but here s a sector action and what you will notice is there s only one sector in the green that is xl k up about one third of a percent utilities in real estate leading to the downside  those are interest rate sensitive and sectors and as we do have uh we do have interest rates heading up today so that makes a lot of sense confirmation there wanna close here with semiconductors  nvidia and broadcom at record highs  you can see broadcom up about 3  so is taiwan semi and really the chip sector as a whole has just been on fire recently and so i guess the question now is how long does it take for the rest of the market to catch up or catch down all right  jared great stuff thanks so much well  jared just mentioned it and you re taking a look at it right now you ve got nvidia notching a fresh record high this morning big tech has been driving this record setting rally that we have seen play out  especially some of the excitement in the markets last week now  the sector accounting for over 61  of the s and p five hundred s gains so far this year here to discuss tech s outsized  impact on markets and much more we wanna bring in matt maley he is miller ta ta uh managing director and equity strategist  matt it s great to see you here so let s talk about that concentration that we saw have seen play out here in the markets we are initially  we re talking about some concerns  some risk that that might signal here for the broader market what do you think just about where we are the current valuations and whether or not maybe there is too much worry about that narrow concentration well  you know  you never like to see a narrow rally having said that uh you know  this time last year  we had a very similar narrow rally and yet it kept going for another month and a half and it really didn t see a pullback until we got to august um but  you know  it  it  one of the things that does tell us is that  you know  investors aren t all that confident about anything outside of the a i uh phenomenon and we haven t seen the big  uh  broadening out of ernie outside of the a i phenomenon we have this  you know  the people are making the chips  the picks and the shovels are doing well  but it s not  you know  it s  we re not seeing the end users of these chips really  you know  seeing a big increase in earnings so that s going to be a big concern i mean  the the and p weight index that you guys were talking about  it s down four weeks in a row while  while the snp has been rallying uh quite nicely so this divergence is something we do need to be concerned about you know uh yes  maybe it does need to fall a little bit further before it creates some problems but um whenever you see a  a narrow market  especially when it s as incredibly narrow as this one is  uh it does raise some questions so ma am  what does that tell us about the 6440 portfolio and i asked because i m on the phone with my mom over the weekend talking to her about what should be she should be doing with her retirement funds and i know you re not gonna give us investment advice  but when you do have that level of concentration  should you be pouring in more doubling down getting in on just tech or should you be hedging your risks a little bit because concentration could go bad really quickly yeah and one of the things right  right now  uh  mat is  is that we have this  this situation where  uh  it s interesting this in the last week or so so we heard some people talk about  you know  using a barbell strategy  which is something we ve heard a lot in the past  but this seems to make a little bit of sense i mean  these  these companies that are  you know  out performing so well are making money i mean  nvidia  uh it is not an expensive stock if you look at it on a  on a long term basis  but you getting 5  in  in cash right now  which is outperforming  as i mentioned  i mean  you know  the s and p equal weight  uh index of russell 2000 is down on the year uh you know  a lot of this stuff in the middle is not acting very well so why not have  if you re going to be overweight in those  those and those big caps that are doing so well and are  uh are getting some  some nice earnings  why not have a little bit in cash on the other side  uh for protection if the thing does start to turn down  man  when you take a look at what the fed is going to do next  it s  it s too much influence being placed or too much emphasis  i should say  being placed on the exact timing from of a  of a fed rate cut and ultimately  we don t get one this year what s that going to do to investor sentiment  do you think well  yeah  that s certainly gonna be  i mean  let s say we went to what  expecting seven rate cuts and down to three now we re down to one and  you know  we couldn t even get zero that would certainly throw a wrench into the works because i mean  let s face it the market is trading at 22 times  uh  forward earnings for  well  for 2024 and 21 or more than 21 times the next 12 months so the  you know  so now we have a situation where the markets principle  we don t have ultra low interest rates to kind of justify that big high valuation so that does create problems and then the other side  we also have to worry about what happens if they  if they suddenly start to cut rates in a meaningful way uh  you know  that  you know  in other words  what reason would they have to cut rates more  uh  more quickly and that would be  of course  that the economy is slowing down and that s not what we want uh  because that there would be a negative impact for earnings and an expensive market that s not a  that s not a big thing so we  you know  we re definitely as we move into the summer months  we are  uh  you know  have some concerns out there and that s why i think some  a little bit more cash on hand is not a bad  is not a bad investment idea how high does that put the bar then for the next earnings cycle and is that bar so high that at a certain point  these tech companies are not going to be able to keep up with the amount of growth that the street is looking for that s the big concern i mean  it is an election year we know we ve got a lot of fiscal uh uh stimulus in  in the marketplace and it s going to be there it s not like congress has to pass anything more they ve already passed it a long time ago and the administration back and loaded it so  so  uh into this year so we  we  we get some nice uh liquidity but earnings  you know  remember last year  the stock market rallied 25  on zero earnings growth so  i mean  you know  if  if we re and we re already up  you know  so since the beginning of 2023 we ve had a 38 39  rally in the s and p 500 yet their earnings have only grown are expected to grow over the two years uh  you know  23 and 24 12  at some point  we have to get a big increase in se in the second half we are looking for  you know  a nice increase in 3rd  3rd quarter or fourth quarter  but it s going to have to be even better than the expectations are right now or  or it s just  i just think this evaluation thing is  is become a problem matt le le let s talk about what s going on in the rest of the world here and the impact that that could ultimately have on the us markets and  and investors watching this show  when you take a look at what is playing out right now in france  when you take a look  even from a geopolitical risk perspective  the latest on the war in israel  uh israel s war with hamas  what should investors keep in mind here just in terms of the risk that that could ultimately pose here to the global markets and what that could mean to the us yeah  i  you know  ii i sea  i just really think that the  the  the situation is the complacency surrounding these uh uh geopolitical risk is  is awfully high again  some of that has to do with the  the liquidity in the marketplace and the market keeps going higher i i can t worry about these things i mean  let s face it uh the  the situation in the middle east has been going on for 778 months now and it hasn t had an impact but you know  that issue is not  it stopped escalating it s only been escalating very gradually  but it keeps escalating and now we start thinking everything with uh in the north of israel and hezbollah and the conflicts there  if this becomes a wider  you know  a wider war and that impacts the stock prices  you know  with the straits of war move  shutting down or something like that you got a big problem and uh it s  it s  i just worry that and of course  with this thing with france  everybody is saying  don t worry about it  but we ve seen what sovereign debt crisis done in the past so again  with 5  cash  i m not saying  oh jeez  you should suddenly go to 50  cash or even 20  cash but you know  it  it gives you a little bit easier to sleep at night when you have some of these things going on over there and you re actually paid to wait and actually paid uh to have a little bit of cash so raising that level a little bit i think is a good idea  very important for investors to consider all right  matt maley  always great to talk to you thanks so much for making the time for us here this morning  miller tayback  managing director and equity strategist thanks  matt thank you well  coming up a deep dive into tesla s growth story  we are going to talk to one analyst on why he sees sentiment improving for the ev giant in the coming months you re looking at gains of just about 1  here for tesla and early market trading we ll be right back tesla shares moving to the upside here of nearly 1 5  after the ev giants shareholder meeting at that meeting musk predicted that tesla s optimist robots could eventually lift the company s market cap to  25 trillion one of the other catalyst that wall street is watching for deeper dive in a tesla s growth story we are joined by the am us auto parts and analyst here thank you so much for joining us here i want to start on what you are anticipating based on what we heard from musk specifically with regards to new product announcement sometimes it s tough to kind of suss out whether or not musk s approach is necessarily going to prove to come to fruition what did you make of the teasing out of certain new products to come at that meeting absolutely good morning and thank you for having me yeah  there is a lot of anticipation for the next round of new products from tesla uh last quarter they did allude to launching uh more affordable electric vehicles uh off some of the same platforms they have today and leveraging some of the manufacturing capacity they have today and launching these vehicles next year there are really two things people are looking for in these vehicles the first of course is the price just given that evs do need to become more affordable and  and you know  there s some opportunity for growth uh at lower price points but the second thing that we re particularly looking for is really just the overall design and content of these vehicles because the ultimate question i think for investors is going to be that will these vehicles generate the same type of excitement we ve seen for other high volume vehicles in the past  such as of course the model three and the model y if the answer to that question is yes  we do see scope for sentiment to improve as the focus would then turn to these new products driving additional growth uh versus which is really needed just given some of the demand  uh headwinds that both electric vehicles of what we re seeing around the world that a tesla specifically is  is facing given some of the aging out of their current portfolio so todd two follow up questions on that one what do you think prices should be at or need to be at to really spark that demand we ve been talking a lot about lower prices  but i guess more specifically is there a range that you think is critical for tesla to get to and then two  when you talk about the tesla story specifically and what these new products  what these new uh vehicles need to be equipped with in order to generate that excitement what do you think needs to be incorporated in order to see uh that excitement play out in the market yeah  there s a lot of technologies but whether it s uh in the interior of the vehicle or  or  or even others uh that  that could just create more of a change  right when you think about large car companies as they grow  there does need to be different design languages  even different sub brands in those vehicles to really appeal to a wider audience uh around  around the world because when you look at different regional tastes and regional consumer preference that they do tend to vary not only by  by country  but even within regions in certain countries  including here in the us so  you know  we want to see a lot of innovation  maybe different design languages  but really whatever it takes of course  tesla is very good at innovation and very good at product to create a lot of uh incremental excitement and  and price points are are clearly important  but we ve been on the view uh the price isn t tesla s number one issue today we would actually rank just the overall aging of the portfolio as being maybe a bigger issue for the company today than just price alone so of course  we want to see 30 40 000 and eventually even lower than that of course  tesla s had aspirations to launch a  25 000 ev of course  so we re mindful of the price points uh and of course  the price points relative to the content you re getting  it s all ultimately all about the value for dollars uh but we really are focus is overall on the content on the design  on the innovation um to really undersee whether you know  investors and consumers  of course  can get really excited about new vehicles uh that could be very high volume vehicles for the company so it is a very significant focal point here over the next few months itai i wonder if you can talk a little bit about the path to autonomous vehicles and you sort of mentioned the varying global appetite for a variety of things coming from tesla to what extent is the kind of bifurcation and interest in being in a full self driving vehicle across countries globally sort of a potential headwind for tesla moving forward yeah no  it really all depends on  on kind of the the different opportunities within how you think about launching autonomous vehicles so we are very bullish on the opportunity within autonomous vehicles overall lower cost per mile and new business models and the opportunity not only to increase revenue streams  but even to grab revenue streams that exist in the value chain today and bring it kind of back up to that automaker ecosystem i think autonomous vehicles tend to be um often defined as sort of one business model of the so called urban robo taxi but actually there are a lot of different business models in theory that a company could launch tesla has a couple of very unique advantages in our view one being that we do think that they could probably launch perhaps the cheapest and lowest cost robo taxi platform out there  not only from a hardware cost perspective  but also from an operating cost and network cost perspective and if we re right about that  that could actually lead to potential new opportunities of how to deploy autonomous vehicles for example  you might not need to deploy the most dense areas you can actually maybe go to relatively easier areas and then maybe even launch some services on your current ecosystem of  of consumer vehicles and robo taxi vehicles  things like peer to peer uh vehicle landing  things like uh you know  you order something at nine o clock at night and the vehicle travels to get it for you at 2 a m  y 2 a m  because you know  the safest autonomous vehicles aren t gonna be the one driving without any uh person in the vehicle uh in  in  in relative times where a few people are out on the road uh and the vehicle can kind of bring you those items that you ordered uh in the morning and so there s a lot of different ecosystem effects so we think that you can create uh to sell more vehicles  create new revenue streams and ultimately try to supplement uh the consumer fleet with  with robo taxi because the number one  you know  fact that we think they have to get right uh when they kind of reveal that the robo taxi day uh is of course the cost and then the vehicle itself  but ultimately is how are you going to deploy autonomous vehicles in a way that s first and foremost  safe  but also can lead to additional revenue streams that maybe people aren t really thinking about today nata before we let you go  if tesla is in fact able to do all of that  what is the upside then look like for tesla yeah  we re still neutral on the stock just give me some near term  you know  fundamental headwinds we talked about uh i think our estimates are still actually below consensus but if you can turn the story into a the new evs we talked about and b if the company can craft a credible autonomous vehicle deployment plan that leverages their advantages  we think there is scope for sentiment to improve here in the next few months it s gonna be a very important few months for them uh to kind of try to reshape the narrative given some of the near term headwinds that they re facing ty malley always great to have you thanks so much for joining us here this morning city s us autos and auto parts analyst thanks so much  atty well  coming up  disney is back with its blockbuster debut of inside out too with the signals for the summer box office and how big of a boost this could be here for disney we ve got that for you next  disney is back at the box office smashing expectations with its new release inside out to bringing in 100 and  55 million domestically just in first weekend  the first film since last year s barbie that s debuted above that  100 million mark young finances  alexander now has the details for us all this is a big deal for the box office and finally  a little bit of optimism about people coming back in yes big deal for the box office also a big deal for disney that is really struggled with its pixar films and animated films the film was the second highest theatrical opening of an animated movie and the first film since barbie to cross that 100 million mark in its debut and we have seen pixar really struggle when it comes to the relevancy at the box office when it comes to getting those butts and seats but recently  there s been a strategy shift from pixar when it comes to the types of films that they not only that they re producing  but how many films they plan to show in theaters we ve heard disney ceo i preached this quality over quantity strategy and that s echo throughout multiple facets of this business and when it comes to pixar  their strategy is going to be sequels  sequel  sequels and less movies than previous so three movies every two years with every other film being either a sequel or a spin off now  this comes as it still continues to face pretty stiff competition from movie producers like nbc universal and sony so the point here is to drive home this built in audience that if you continue to create movies that have that loyal fan base up to a point  people will continue to come out so of course  we  we ve seen the strategy fail before  i mean light year that was a sequel in 2022 that really did not perform well at all so they need to pick and choose what types of movies they wanna recreate for spinoffs and sequels and also a big emphasis on the box office not as much disney plus because that was a point of confusion as well yeah  exactly and it is interesting just how many people went out and saw inside out too and really the excitement that they were able to build surrounding this release so ali it looks like that s good news here  at least for disney i also want to talk about a headline that came out over the weekend in regards to deadpool being released in china because this could also be a big break for disney potentially as well yeah and look the china relationship with the us when it comes to films  it s been a bit strained we saw top gun maverick  it was not approved to be released in china  which was a big surprise considering those big action films to do well in the country but deadpool two has been restricted the first deadpool movie was barred in the country when it was released in 2016 then they allowed a pg 13 version of 2018 deadpool two and now we have this approval here so  so this could be a big boon when we think about the opportunity for international exposure  the opportunity to bring some of those more overseas dollars to these films  especially at a time when in the us  we re seeing a bit of a pull back when it comes to the types of movies that people and want to see in the theater although i do expect that the deadpool franchise is  is one that often gets the people going when it comes to going to that theater  you wanna be with other people  you wanna cheer and  and laugh at some of that as a loyal fan base and we ll see how exactly it does and what the reception is like there right ali great stuff thanks well  coming up  can the markets rally keep going we re gonna dive into the catalyst behind the stock markets  climb higher what it s going to take to continue that march to the upside we ve got that for you next on the catalyst ',

                        '(Bloomberg) -- Elon Musk inaugurated SpaceX’s Starlink internet services in Indonesia on Sunday as the world’s largest archipelago seeks to boost connectivity to its most remote areas.Most Read from BloombergIran State TV Says ‘No Sign of Life’ at Helicopter Crash SiteEbrahim Raisi, Iranian President Confronting West, Dies at 63Speedier Wall Street Trades Are Putting Global Finance On EdgeSaudi Crown Prince Postpones Japan Trip Over King’s HealthChina’s Housing Rescue Too Small to End Crisis, Analysts SayThe inauguration took place at a community health center in Bali. The billionaire, clad in a green batik and mobbed by onlookers, said he was excited to bring Starlink to Indonesian villages with no connectivity or very low bandwidth, adding “this can really be a lifesaver” for patients seeking medical treatment.As well as connecting far-flung provinces, Indonesia expects Starlink to improve education and health outcomes, Coordinating Minister of Maritime Affairs and Investment Luhut Panjaitan said in a statement. Starlink, which delivers broadband internet from SpaceX’s satellites, received a license to operate in the country earlier this month.Indonesian President Joko Widodo has long been courting Musk to cap off his decade-long bid to make Indonesia a destination of choice for foreign investors. Musk said in Bali that it’s likely his other companies “will invest in Indonesia in the future,” without giving details.Jokowi, who had earlier been slated to attend the Starlink inauguration in Bali, was not in attendance.In September, Jokowi said Indonesia was still in discussions with Tesla Inc. to invest in the nation’s burgeoning battery industry, despite the downturn in the electric-vehicle market. Starlink is also set to test its internet services in Indonesia’s planned new capital city Nusantara, which Jokowi aims to inaugurate by August.(Updates throughout with details of the Starlink launch)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekNetflix Had a Password-Sharing Problem.

                        '(Bloomberg) -- Norway’s $1.7 trillion sovereign wealth fund said it would vote against the $56 billion pay package for Tesla Inc. Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk, adding to opposition for the carmaker ahead of its annual general meeting next week.Most Read from BloombergPutin Is Running Out of Time to Achieve Breakthrough in UkraineRussia Is Sending Young Africans to Die in Its War Against UkraineThere’s Still a Way to Snag a 3% Mortgage RatePhilippines Rejects ‘Absurd’ Beijing Demand Over South China SeaScholz’s SPD Suffers Record Rout in Germany’s EU Vote“We remain concerned about the total size of the award, the structure given performance triggers, dilution, and lack of mitigation of key person risk,” Norges Bank Investment Management - the official name of the fund - said in a statement Saturday.The vote at next week’s AGM will be the second time Musk’s pay package has been put before shareholders. A judge voided an initial vote that approved the package in 2018. Proxy advisers Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis & Co. have recommended investors reject the proposal.NBIM also voted against the pay package in 2018, though about three-quarters of investors backed it at the time. A Delaware judge voided the deal earlier this year, saying investors weren’t fully informed of key details.The decision is “consistent with our vote on the same award in 2018,” the Norwegian fund said, adding it will “continue to seek constructive dialog with Tesla on this and other topics.”The outcome of the shareholder vote is only advisory, though a loss would be a major embarrassment to Tesla’s board and to its top executive. Musk has also threatened to build products outside of Tesla if he can’t increase his equity holdings in the company, something the pay deal would allow him to do.While NBIM said it would vote in favor of a management proposal to move the company’s corporate home to Texas from Delaware, it plans to back a shareholder proposal calling on Tesla to adopt new policies related to collective bargaining and freedom of association.The latter proposal, a response to an almost seven-month long strike by Swedish Tesla technicians, is being supported by several of the Nordic region’s biggest asset owners. Tesla has urged shareholders to vote against it, saying “the company is already committed to protecting its employees’ rights.”NBIM owned a 0.98% holding worth $7.72 billion in Tesla as of the end of 2023, according to its website. It issues its voting intentions five days before the AGMs of the companies it invests in.Story continues(Updates with context on collective bargaining proposal in eighth paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekLegacy Airlines Are Thriving With Ultracheap Fares, Crushing Budget CarriersSam Altman Was Bending the World to His Will Long Before OpenAIDavid Sacks Tried the 2024 Alternatives.

                        "Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) employees are fearful as the rolling layoffs are expected to continue through at least June.Over a month into CEO Elon Musk's plan to cut at least 10% of the workforce, the process is ongoing, causing employees to anxiously check their messages daily, uncertain of their job security.Former Tesla sales representative Michael Minick, who was laid off in April, shared his experience on LinkedIn, describing the constant fear and uncertainty among employees, reported Bloomberg.\"It's difficult to imagine the feeling of walking on eggshells every day at work,\" Minick wrote.The company's workforce has undergone significant changes, with a focus now on projects like artificial intelligence and robotics rather than solely on electric vehicles.Current employees say Musk's emphasis on a robotaxi over a $25,000 electric vehicle has dampened morale, Bloomberg report notes.The company laid off 693 employees at its Nevada facilities with China facing escalating job cuts as it contends with pressure to regain market share in the world's largest auto market.The latest job reduction last week involved 600 more jobs at Tesla's manufacturing facilities and engineering offices in Fremont and Palo Alto, California. The original mission that once inspired many has become unclear. The ongoing turmoil has contributed to a 29% decline in Tesla's share value this year, resulting in a $224 billion loss in market capitalization.Musk has not yet assured employees that the job cuts are finished, leading to an atmosphere of anxiety. One employee likened the situation to \"Squid Game,\" the popular TV series where contestants face deadly challenges.Thousands of employees across various departments, including sales, human resources, and the Supercharger division, have already been affected.The company started the year with over 140,000 employees, but Musk aims for a 20% reduction in headcount.The Supercharger division, crucial for Tesla's network of over 6,200 stations and 57,000 connectors worldwide, has seen significant layoffs. Some employees, including the director of charging for North America, Max de Zegher, discovered layoffs by seeing their Microsoft Teams icons turn gray.Although de Zegher was rehired, it's uncertain how many others will be brought back.The reduction in workforce has left gaps in maintaining and fixing Supercharger stations, particularly in Northern California and Canada, potentially leading to service disruptions.As Tesla navigates these turbulent times, the broader EV industry faces sluggish demand, compounding the pressure on its workforce.This has prompted Tesla's largest layoffs to date as subdued consumer sentiment has dented sales.Tesla stock has lost more than 7% in the last 12 months. Investors can gain exposure to the stock via ETFs, including Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLY) and Fidelity MSCI Consumer Discretionary Index ETF (NYSE:FDIS).Price Action: TSLA shares are trading lower by 2.05% at $173.83 at the last check Monday.Disclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.Photo via Shutterstock\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!Get the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?This article Tesla Layoffs To Continue Through June, Morale Low Among Workers originally appeared on Benzinga.com© 2024 Benzinga.com.

(NASDAQ:TSLA) designs, manufactures, and sells electric vehicles (EVs), related software and components, and solar and energy storage products. Shares fell 29.3% in the first quarter as the core automotive segment is facing headwinds due to a complex macroeconomic environment, factory shutdowns, growing competitive risks in China, and vehicle price reductions which are pressuring gross margins. During the first quarter of 2024, production was also negatively impacted by the Red Sea maritime supply[1]chain interferences, sabotage in a Tesla factory’s power supply in Berlin, and a factory closure for the launch of the refreshed Model 3. We remain shareholders. Tesla commenced delivery of its highly anticipated Cybertruck pickup, which features new technologies within the car and its manufacturing lines. Tesla also launched version 12 of its Full Self Driving product, which shows significant progress from prior versions and increases the probability that Tesla’s data collection at scale, and verticalized software and hardware approach will position Tesla as a leader in the future for autonomous driving and shared mobility. We also expect energy storage sales to continue to grow over the coming years as the adoption of renewable energy continues.

                        "Nvidia (NVDA) continues to dominate the tech sector as the company's shares move past $1,100. The chip giant earned a boost from Elon Musk, who announced that xAI's supercomputer will run on Nvidia technology. Meanwhile, Tesla (TSLA) shareholders are awaiting an important vote on June 13, which will dictate the fate of Musk's proposed pay package of $56 billion. The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) will hold its annual meeting in Chicago this week, exploring the latest advancements in the cancer research sector. Tom Steyer, Galvanize Climate Solutions Co-Executive Chair, also joins the show to give insight into the state of climate change mitigation under a possible second Trump presidency.For more expert

ultimate investing playbook to help tune out the noise and make the right move for your money.And here's your headline blitz getting you up to speed one hour for the closing bell rings on Wall Street.It's not a surprise that the consumer is feeling well.It's actually been a little bit more of a surprise that the consumer had felt a bit challenged.We have a historically low unemployment rate and the wealth effects of investing in the market continue to go up.So it shouldn't be a, a major surprise that consumers are feeling.Well.One thing to keep in mind is you don't know if sell in May works until, until June, right?I mean, sell in April didn't work.We know that sell in early May didn't work.We kind of know that but we don't yet know if sell in May didn't work.We're coming into this month, we're ending this month, I should say on a very exuberant note, um stock, you know, basically, no matter how you measure it.There's, there's very little fear and a lot of grief, one of the key elements of the buy out products that we offer is zero interest.And so to some degree, we're seeing, you know, a continuous acceleration of our growth and, and preference among us consumers due to the fact that actually from that stretch, a lot of that stretch comes from the higher interest rates on the credit cards and other lending products, right?And actually to some degree biop becomes a more attractive offer, we've got one hour to go until the market closed.So let's take a look at the major averages while that exuberance over the longer term does remain intact that you heard Steve.So talking about just there, we've got a little bit more of a mixed picture today and that's because the big economic data of the week comes at the end of the week that is in the form of P CE which is the Feds preferred inflation indicator that said we did get a reading on consumer confidence today showed a rebound for the first time in four months that coming to us from the conference board that not really mitigating the declines we're seeing at the moment with the dow down about 300 points of about three quarters of 1% the S and P down about a quarter percent.Story continuesThe NASDAQ is the outlier here today to the upside.It's at the lows of the session but still up about a quarter percent.And as we try and weigh all of this economic data, we see the 10 year note of the yield back above 4.5%.We haven't seen it at that level in quite some time.A pretty big move upward today of about seven basis points.So, um that may be causing a little bit concern.We're up about the same level that we were really coming into May.So something to keep an eye on there.Also watching what's going on with the sectors today.We've got health care, industrials, financials that are weak energy and tech are on the rise today.And speaking of tech, when we talk about the NASDAQ being the outlier to the upside, we're going to dig into it later.But NVIDIA rising to another record today, Amazon and alphabet also on the rise.But really uh that, that um strongest performer there would be NVIDIA among large cap tech, Josh.All right, Julie stocks mixed as investors attention remains focused on the federal curve in their path to get inflation back to that 2% target for more on what's ahead for the market.Let's welcome in Rob Hayworth us Bank, Wealth Management, Senior Investment strategist, Rob.It is good to see you.So you know, you heard Julie there stocks wavering today, Rob.But unfortunately, you know, we had a a nice rally.So where do you think rob the market?Heads kind of near to intermediate term here.Do you wanna be putting more money to work at these levels?Rob?Well, certainly.Uh, today, this week it seems a little tough.We've got a lot of questions ahead of that.Fed, uh measure of inflation, the fed's preferred measure of inflation on Friday, but over the longer term, yeah, we think this is a growth oriented market where the economy is holding up fairly well and there's room for earnings to continue to expand.Uh We've seen analysts start to take up a full year, 2024 earnings expectations.We're, we're estimating around $244 a share depending upon which service you look at.Uh and that's probably enough to keep this market in positive territory for the year.Still lots of questions ahead but, but we'd be constructive over the long term, maybe a little cautious watching this week as the data unfolds.Hey, Robert, it's Julie here.So what could be, you know, of all of those questions which is perhaps the most dangerous for the market, so to speak.Wow.Yeah, I, well, certainly we have the election coming up.That's probably uh a question but probably a couple of months down the road in the near term.I think the question is what is the fed doing?Uh And that's some of what I think we're seeing with the tape today is there's a lot of questions from the market about FED speakers and how likely is the fed to start to cut rates?We're now seeing that maybe it's not uh an event until November or December and maybe we get one this year instead of multiple.Uh So I think that fed uh those, those fed speakers remain highly important and how the ad inflation data evolves is where the market is going to be really focused.One issue, Rob, you know, I want to get your take on this because Ed Yardeni, the, the strategist and economist in his note to his clients this morning, Rob, he really zoned in on geopolitical conflict and, and what's front and center there really.And of course, you know, Russia, Ukraine, Rob and China Taiwan, Israel Hamas.How do you think about that as a strategist in terms of just kind of economic and policy implications?No, great great point.It, it's something where we really haven't seen much of a market impact yet.But we're for our clients, we're thinking about it as really being the epicenter in, in commodity markets, commodity markets in general are in shorter supply right now, whether we think about oil uh metals.Uh we're even seeing some, some supply disappointments when it comes to the US grain inventories.Uh So we've actually thought that we want to own some inflation protection and portfolios against those geopolitical risks.And we're thinking about broadly diversified commodity exposure there.And at the same time, it's interesting because, you know, obviously those are also a risk, as you said to, to the um upside for inflation when you were talking about, um what's gonna happen with the Federal Reserve this year at this point?Does it matter to equity markets if there's a cut or not?In other word?Is it almost agnostic to there being a cut?Uh I think it depends on which sectors.So the agnostic part is probably the artificial intelligence and, and growth part of the market that we're seeing just natural growth rates with or without the fed cutting rates.Uh But we've seen smaller companies uh interest rate, sensitive companies thinking utilities and, and real estate have struggled with higher rates for longer.That could be the challenging part of the market.Uh Is if they don't get fed rate cuts.Uh Is there some, some further pressure on those multiples as we look over the rest of the year and, and Rob just sticking with the, the fed, you know, Jay Powell's favorite key inflation metric.Uh P ce Rob, we're gonna get that on Friday.What do you expect?How important do you think that is to the market?Uh I think it is fairly important.I mean, the surprises would be out of if we're, if we're, if we overshoot last month's reading or undershoot last month's reading right now.I think consensus is about a 0.3% increase, about 2.8% year over year.Uh, we, we don't have anything to tell us to think differently than that, but we'd be worried if there was a, make an overshoot or undershoot.Uh, and the mar that's where the market would really start to react.Um, are there any other places in the market that you think?Um, it, it's good to be right.I mean, would you be in artificial intelligence, for example, as well as you mentioned some of those commodities?But A I on the other hand, is that a good place to be?Well, some of those names have been uh have certainly seen a surge in the last week in the last couple of days.So it's, it's tough to buy at these levels.But in the longer term, yes, we think that's a place uh that investors need to have uh some money put, put invested just to be able to benefit from what looks to be longer term productivity growth.But is right now, at least an epicenter epicenter of corporate investment.How about fixed income investors, Rob?Listen right now, if you're looking for advice, what's your guidance?Yeah, we're uh really interested in looking at credit both in the municipal space and in the corporate space.We think there's room to run here even though you're seeing uh valuations are on the rich side.That this solid economic growth scenario we have for the US economy is giving companies earnings room to run and earnings and some room to kind of continue to make those payments.So we think there's room for investors to kind of capture that extra yield, whether it's high yield bonds, uh AAA collateralized loan obligations and in the municipal bond space, we'd look to the lower quality end of the in the market because uh because we think there's high, it's still kind of low distress there and, and room for people to capture those yields.All right, Rob, good to see you.Thanks a lot.Thank you very much.We're just getting started here on market domination.Coming up, shares of video are soaring to another all time high today.On the back of an announcement from Elon Musk, we'll check in on the latest trend tickers on the other side, plus a slew of retailers are set to report quarterly results this week, providing insight on consumer spending.We'll take a look at the sector in today's investor playbook and at 430 Eastern time, it's the latest edition of asking for a trend.I've got you covered with the biggest market moving stories affecting your money.Stay tuned, more market coverage after this.Let's check in on some of the top trending tickers from Yahoo finance.com, Invidia, top of the leaderboard today.Yet again, those shares are trending higher following an announcement from Elon Musk that his A I start up Xa I is in the process of building a supercomputer to be powered by nvidia's chip technology.Really.What we learned is how much he had raised in order to power that $6 billion valuing all of Xa I at about $18 billion and the sort of there have been, has been talk in the past that it was gonna, he was gonna use in video chips.So this confirmation that he raised the money, it was like, ok, now he has the money to pay for all this chips.Yeah, that's right.I mean, it's interesting because what Elon Musk is kind of saying here is that when it comes to these LL MS, these large language models, I'm gonna be a player with Xa I and you kind of already know Julie who some of the core winners are gonna be there like, you know, open A I and Meta.But he's now saying, listen, Xa I is gonna be one.I was impressed with some of the, the, the investors who piled in here.I mean, these are marquee names and Isilon Valley that put money to work.It's Andre Horowitz, it's Coya and when he raised $6 billion to your point, listen, you if you're gonna be a player in LL MS, everybody knows you're gonna need NVIDIA.So a lot of people be it.Are you, you just raise 6 billion.How much of that is flowing rights Jensen.Yeah, I mean, and he has said in the past that he would need the, that 100,000 specialized semiconductors for this uh for Grok, which is Xais Chat bot.Exactly.Grok from stranger in a strange land.It is a, it is a sci fi classic.And to Grok, something is like to implicitly understand something from your fellow human.I never knew that.That's what that was.That's what Grok is from.Go ahead.I was just gonna say, I mean, it's interesting now because you do have the kind of different A I companies sort of clearly laid out and along with who's backing them.So you have Xa I, as you mentioned with Sequoia and Anderson, uh Horowitz uh Andries Hor, it's behind it.You have open A I that of course, has gotten $13 billion from Microsoft and you've got anthropic $4 billion from Amazon.So you have kind of a choose your fighter kind of situation.It's also fun to think about, you know, Elon Musk has this empire and how kind of the pieces flow because you mentioned Gro as chatbot that requires a massive amount of data to train on.And so it's interesting like that'll come from X but then I've seen these reports, they're also already thinking, OK, how much data will flow from Tesla at some point too?Right?And you've got open A I which is forging different agreements with different news organizations and other sources to train its model.So it's very interesting and you know, I won, I don't know if the quality of what they come out with, of the gen A I that they come out with is gonna depend on the, where they're drawing the data from it.It's a great point because is the data that's gonna train grok that fuel a lot of it's gonna come from X?Is that good data?We'll see.I don't know, ask some questions you ask, some people have been asking all of these questions like asking Gemini questions and stuff.They've been getting some wonky answers.Won is a nice way to make pizza anyone.All right, we'll stick with Elon Musk led companies, Tesla shares heading in the other direction today.That's proxy advisory firm, Glass Lewis has recommended that shareholders reject a proposal to reinstate co Elon Musk pay package and y'all will find this his very own pros submarine and joins the show.Now he's been tracking this story and has the latest pros.Hey Josh, how you doing, man?So yeah, you know, um we fix my collar over here.Uh Yes.So Tesla here wanting to sort of have their shareholders approve Musk's 2018 pay package.That was, that was sort of uh rejected by a Delaware Court.Now, what's happening now is Glass Lewis, the the advisory proxy advisory firm says, you know what don't approve that pay package for Musk?It's just too excessive, right?The amount of stock that people are that he is getting is excessively diluted to current shareholders more so than other pay packages that we've seen for the sort of mega cap tech companies, but also Fortune 500 sorry S and P 500 auto companies.No one has seen that kind of pay package here.Musk would argue.Well, you know what, I'm not actually getting a salary here.Look at the, look at what the stock has done over the past five years.I made a lot of money for a lot of people.Why can't I get that pay package?Which was by the way in 2018, approved by stockholders.So that's sort of the kind of the crux of the debate here.Glass is saying that it's not good for shareholders.Neither is the move from uh Delaware Incorporate Incorporation to Texas Incorporation doesn't really make sense.There's too much uncertainties with Texas Business Law at this point.So they're saying stay in Delaware Musk, don't get that pay package.Uh and oh, by the way, he's claimed that he wants at least 25% of, of, of the stockholding share and Tesla always gonna pull out A I and robotics and things like that.And pros the meeting is what June 13th, correct.So, we've heard from Glass Lewis who have we heard from?And are there any big players that we're sort of waiting to hear?Which way they're gonna go?You know, we've had, we see some, a number of smaller shareholders, uh some small pension funds, some other types of funds that have said we're not going to uh approve this uh pay package.They put together a letter last week saying that I think this is a slow drumbeat here of those sort of concerns.And of course, Glass Lew is a bigger player in the proxy advisor was saying that this is not a good pay package, you know, but we're not surprised that glasses and probably iss will come out at some point and say the same thing.But I think the big sort of concern is what is the fidelity of the world are gonna say Blackrocks?Are they gonna say anything?I doubt it.Uh It's gonna be up to the smaller shareholders, I guess.And prize.I'm very interested to get your take on on this.Let's say shareholders rejected that pay package.What do you think Elon Musk was, would be I'm honestly not sure.I don't know if he would say, you know, what, who needs this?I have other areas I could put my focus on, right.I got spacex.I got Julie and I were just talking about Xa I or is it no?Like he's just, I mean, I can't think of another company where the founder so embedded, I mean, Tesla is Musk.Musk is Tesla.What, how do you, what do you think his response might be?You know, he hasn't gotten paid, believe it or not in 2018, but his current holding of stock around 12 to 13% has seen his, seen that sort of his stake in the company, the, the value that go up tremendously.So he's not like he's, he's suffering here.Uh Do I see him leaving the company?I don't know, maybe he steps back a little bit.Maybe he does fall through that threat in the Xa I and what you were talking about earlier and other of his companies get more of the attention from the A I and robotics point of view.It's hard to say what he might actually because he's such a mercurial character that from one whim to the next, you don't exactly know where he's gonna go with that.But from a Tesla point of view, I think he knows that it's too valuable for him to, if he left his stockholding would, would the shares would go down, right.So I think he, he knows he's got to stay in their state, but maybe you'll actually see a better, more balanced pay package from the board, which seems like right now it's just rubber stamping a lot of what he wants.That's for the impression that a lot of people have.So it's hard to say, but you never know with Musk, you never, never know with that guy.You never do.Always make your beat interesting for us.Thank you.Thank you checking in on another trending ticker today in Smed.This is not what we talk about frequently.It's a biotech company that announced positive results from a study of a drug to treat a, a rare lung condition that is called bronchi stasis.Much better.I'm glad you took a swing at that one.So basically this is a lung inflammation.Um and uh it affects, you know, not a huge amount of people, but enough that analysts are very, very positive after seeing the results of this study.Yeah, I was just in terms of Thailand Julie company apparently plans to file for us market clearance in the final quarter of the year, then launch in mid 20 tw 25 filed by launches in Europe and Japan.I, you know, analysts seemed very positive.I saw JP Morgan analyst quote as saying the findings are a home run scenario, say they see the results as transforming the company and unlocking a tree, key driver of value and it sounds like investors were plenty excited too.Yeah, I mean reading between the lines here, some of the other analysts, one it duo said that this should provide a huge sigh of relief for investors as we believe it helps to secure a more positive outlook on the company's future.So obviously, there was some concern over that the company has never turned a profit and it has been public for quite some time about 10 years.The other possibility here as the company says in its statement is this maybe has the potential to address a range of neutrophil mediated diseases.This is a certain type of inflammatory disorder.So there could be potentially other applications.I mean, that's kind of the model with a wide range of drugs.Now you you get it approved for one thing and then potentially it can be used for.I saw another A I was also saying here, the company, you know, does have a fair amount of debt Julie.So maybe I think their point was this rally we're seeing here, gives them the chance to think creatively about some possible financing options too.Makes sense.Well, let's stick with the health care uh sector, shall we?Because thousands of oncology professionals from around the world are set together in Chicago for the Asco annual meeting, the American Clinical Oncologists.There.A grid of sessions will reveal research treatments and visionary insights on cancer treatment for what more on what this means for the biotech sector.Let's get to Jeffrey's biotech analyst, Michael Michael.It is always great to talk to you and I can think of no one better to talk to about this meeting.A number of companies have already released abstracts in advance of the ASCO meeting as they tend to.So tell us, do you have a top one that you're gonna be watching as we get more information at the conference?Oh, well, it's great to be here.Thank you.Good to see you Julian and Josh.Uh obviously, uh the biggest uh cancer conference of the year uh in a week and a half will be there.And it is true that much of the cat is out of the bag.Um Maris in one of those big movers this week and all eyes are focused on some of the updated data at the presentation there.And a couple of others were focused on like immuno T I MC R and Moderna MRN A uh with an update on their phase three cancer vaccine or phase two cancer vaccine data already in phase three with Merc.So there are a couple of the ones happy to talk about others, but of course, a big cancer conference of the year and biotech is moving and shaking as it always is.And Michael, quick question for, you know, earlier in the show, I was talking to Julie about um all things A I and of course, we talk a lot of the show about how, you know A I obviously early days Michael, but there is this real interest about how this technology could kind of upend and disrupt a lot of industries.I have been reading some reports.There's already some talk about how, how A I could maybe reshape the field of oncology as well.Michael.Any thoughts on that?Well, look, um first of all, there's only a couple of sort of pure play software platform A I related companies, uh Schrodinger ticker, Sdgr and uh Recursion rxrx which actually has a deal with NVIDIA.Um uh So check that out.Uh But a lot of the early investment have been going into a bunch of private companies.As you can imagine, the drug discovery uh process can take 10 years.And there is a wealth of discovery and work being done early on for new targets using A I and attempts at looking at large language models to discover new targets.But those are pretty early.Uh and uh certainly a risky, but most of them are private.And before we dig into some of these names that you're talking about, and um I'm interested in Marri, in particular, which you mentioned.Um I, I guess for people who are not as steeped in this as you are Michael, um going into this meeting kind of, I know this is a big question.Where are we in terms of cancer treatment and research?Right?Kind of where are we on the curve of being able to treat most types of cancers?And uh is there anything sort of revelatory that you're expecting?Well, you know, you're asking uh an important question and I think it depends on the time horizon of, you know, maybe 10 years ago, it was all about chemotherapy and maybe new antibodies uh from Genetech like Avastin over the next 5 to 7 years, we now have been on the immuno oncology, IO wave certainly with PD ones and new developments across PD one and other immuno oncology, drugs, which has been fantastic.And now you're on the brink of also new uh no modalities like car T uh and other attempts at cancer vaccines uh holistically like the moderna cancer vaccine and others.And I think we're still looking for the next generation.I think the answer is that you're not going to have a one product, one pill, cancer cure anytime soon.But we are making great strides over years to make big steps in cancer.And I think that when you uh perhaps has been spoiled and look at something just five or seven years ago when we did not PD one.And now you look at the types of efficacy that PD one has brought for us.I think we'd all be pleased.Uh Sometimes, maybe our hurdles are just uh uh a little bit too high and we're trying to find a cure but it takes time.But we have been making great strides and that's why Julie that people are all focused on the thousands of cancer drugs at the Asco conference and investing in biotech.And why all these ipos are going out is because there are great promise of the next.So let's get to Maris then and this company specifically came out with the results of a study in head and neck cancer.Mr Us is the ticker and that one for people who are not familiar with it.Now, the stock surged, it has since come back down a little bit.It hasn't retraced all of it.Like, how should people think about trading a stock like Marris around an event like this when it, you know, because it already came out with the abstract from its study?Yeah.Um, well, look, I think that, uh, in many respects, we try to think about buying stocks in advance of all of that.And Jeffrey has been vated and been bullish on that going into it, the data played out in the abstract and then in the uh early presentation that they hosted this morning, uh with more data and the stock obviously has gone up over that time period.And now we're at a new step where uh obviously we're going to start phase three.I think most people would think about trading this as we have great data as they move forward into phase three, whether it's a potential uh take out target or obviously one of the more promising drugs that had a cancer.I don't think we'd be trying to day trade that but rather say that this is a very promising cancer company going to phase three could be a take out target.Hey, Michael, can I squeeze one last one in?Because I'm curious to get your take on this besides A I Michael, I'm not sure there's another trend we talk about more than G LP ones in your opinion, Michael.Still a mega trend hot as ever.And if so are there ways to play it besides Eli Lilly and NOVO nodes?Sure great.So we have said specifically that these types of waves come once in a decade or two.Uh We believe that the G LP one wave is still relatively early in the multiyear cycle.We believe obviously that uh Lillian Noble as you've talked about, specifically Lily uh is obviously attractive and they'll be a major player.We have said Amgen is one of the most important larger cap companies that we have been very bullish on.And they too will go to phase three with a monthly G LP one.And we think the data is gonna be great at the end of the year, there's also smaller companies uh like Rock, uh Srrk or Cor that also have new modalities um that are interesting.And so a lot of these smaller cap companies I think are promising because the upside potential for that data in $100 billion T A is great and the M and a potential for these is great and we still think we're relatively early in the cycle.Michael Terrific to have you on the show.Thanks so much for joining us.Thank you guys coming up.There may be reason to be optimistic in the war against climate change.We're gonna tell you more on the other side when market domination returns.Since last year, the average person has seen nearly a month's worth of extra hotter than usual days.And those additional abnormal days can be attributed to human clause caused climate change.That's according to a recent analysis from nonprofit Climate central but not all hope is lost at least.According to my next guest, he says there is reason to be optimistic in the war against climate change.Climate investor and activist to steer says there is to be optimistic in that war.He outlines the state of play in a new book, cheaper, faster, better How We win the climate war?And he's joining me now in the studio.Thanks so much for being here, Julie, thank you for having me.Um I read that report today about those hotter days and it is just the latest in a long line of really depressing news.And we, you know anecdotally, we see these reports in the news every day, right about uh weather events, et cetera.Why are you optimistic?Well, let's start.I I wanna start by confirming everything you say.The news from the natural world has been consistently not just bad but worse than expected.And in fact, this is the hottest planet that human beings have ever walked right now.Um But what people, so people don't always know that but what they also don't know which I know as a result of spending my time professionally investing in companies that are leading the counter revolution is that the technology is better than anybody knows.That not only have solar and wind come down in cost and are, you know, really spreading quickly but that there are in the cliche in the climate world is we're not looking for a silver bullet.We're looking for silver buckshot.Lots of companies addressing lots of problems that can win in the marketplace on their own because they are, in fact, as my book says, cheaper, faster and better, let's win in the marketplace.We can do it and we need people to get together and make it happen.Where are we on that winning in the place?Right?Because one of the other things that you talk about is sort of getting society on the same page you talk about.Um and you talked about in the Q and A accompanying the book as well about the effort around World War Two and Victory Gardens and this sort of sentiment of everybody being on the same team in the same pulling in the same direction doesn't feel like that right now.And it's hard to get people to make daily changes.They want everything to be perfect without having to do anything.Well, let me say this, we're not asking people to sacrifice economically.As I said, if it's not good enough to win in the marketplace, it's not going to happen.But let me give you an example of something where whatever the talk is, we can see what's really happening.That's Texas.If there's a state where the elected officials have disliked.The idea of renewable energy have disliked the idea of whatever ESG is it would be.Texas.Texas has tripled its amount of solar in the last three years and expected to go up another 35%.This year.Texas produces more wind energy than any other state by far.Are they doing that to be nice or to be woke?No, they're doing it because it's cheaper.And when we look around the world, what we're seeing is these new technologies and it's fo that this follows technological breakthroughs for the last 200 years.They spend a lot of time reaching cost comparability and when they break through and are cheaper, faster and better, they go straight up.It's like an, it's described as an S curve and then it flattens out.That's what we're seeing in a lot of technologies, not just solar and wind, but evs and heat pumps and other things.You know, as you talk, I have to ask you about nuclear because there's been a recent and interest in sort of acceptability of nuclear.Where are you on that technology and how, what role it needs to play in all of this?Well, first of all, there are two different kinds of nuclear.So let's try and separate the two.There's the existing technology that's been around which still has plants in the United States that's fission technology.People are trying to build smaller, safer fission reactors.And we'll see if in fact, they can be both safe and cheap.I mean, the real problem with nuclear fission has been no one's been able to build a plant in the United States for a reasonable price for a long time.And so people think nuclear is somehow cheap, it's very, very expensive.Right now.The other kind is nuclear fusion that is a new, very difficult to achieve uh engineering feat.People have been saying are saying, and I've talked to, they are probably 12 big companies trying to solve this.I've talked to the CEO S uh of two of them in the last couple of months and they say if everything goes great, we'll be meaningful in the market in 2040.That's 16 years away.We really don't have 16 years to wait if it comes.That's great.But we need to focus on the next 10 years and really get things going.So as far as I'm concerned, when we think about new electricity generation, that's not the place I'm looking to solve the the shorter intermediate term problem.Speaking of urgent, um this year is a presidential election.You are a supporter of President Biden, you've held fundraisers for him.Um What do you think conversely a Trump presidency would mean for climate change and climate change policy?Well, I think one of the things that I've been trying to say is that clean energy is winning in the marketplace and it's kind of you can say whatever you want as a politician.But if something is cheaper and better people are going to buy it regardless of what you have to say, that's going to go on in the United States.I think, regardless, I think the big question for the United States is that under a Republican administration, we are not gonna do the kind of international leadership, international Cooper operation to build the kind of global institutions and measurement systems so that in fact, we can have a global response to what was once called global warming.This is a problem that concerns everybody on the planet and we're not gonna have the kind of cooper operation that's necessary in co ordination without American leadership.It's not like we're the only country, but we're an indispensable country.And if that, in fact, the Republican administration pulls back as it did under the previous administration.And as they're saying, they're going to then the kind of leadership that we need and cooper with China and India and the rest of the world won't happen.And that means that there will be a delay in terms of building those international systems of cooper measurement and, and standards.What about even domestic legislation?I mean, president, former President Trump reportedly met with a bunch of oil executives said I'm gonna get rid of the IRA if you guys support me.Now, I've spoken to some oil executives and they say they don't like the inconsistency that we've seen in policy, right.That everything flips every four years.Do you think he'd even be able to get rid of the IRA if, if he indeed wins the election?I think most of the IRA is stuff that has been uh deployed or where people have pushed to get things done so they can't be reversed.I think most of it is in red states and it's created a lot of jobs.So I believe in the UN in the United States we are rolling and yes, there will be different speeds and maybe some of the new technologies will be slowed down because they won't get government support.But by and large, the United States is heading on a glide path that has been laid out by the Biden administration.And I think that we're, it, it'll be slower and faster, but we're really gonna get there.We are going to win this whole thing.Let me say Julie, people think two things.They think we're an oil and gas country and we can never get off it.That is absolutely not true.We will get off it.It's a question of how fast.And the second thing is people think we're in a climate doom loop that basically we're destroying the natural world and we can't stop ourselves from doing it.And that is false.What I'm trying to say is this, yes, this is a crisis and it's probably a bigger crisis than most people understand.But it's really a challenge for us and that's how we should think about it.This is something we will win, we will win it together inevitably, this is gonna happen.The question is the sooner we pull together, the sooner we work together and the sooner we recognize that we're really try all trying to make a better world for the future, a safer better world, the sooner we recognize that we all want that same thing and just decide how best to do it.That's when I think the United States is going to step up and do what we've traditionally done, which is solve the big problem, right?I mean, it seems to me that's the tricky part, right?I mean, again, going back to the election, how many people, for example, are voting on this issue?It doesn't seem like, I mean, people are voting on inflation right now.They're not necessarily thinking about climate as their biggest issue.I think that's true.And I think that one of the reasons I wrote this book was to say to people, this is something that really is important.This is something that really affects you.If you're most Americans agree with me, as you said, I mean, most registered Republicans agree with me.They just don't prioritize it.What I'm saying is this is not just something we have to do.This is a great opportunity for America to do the kind of things that we have done in the past that we were really built as a country to do and that involves accepting each other, not villainizing each other, but really coming together and solving big problems.That's what we do best and that's what we're proudest of ourselves for Tom.Thanks for being here.The book is cheaper, faster, better.How we'll win the climate war?Appreciate your time.Thank you for having me.All right, let's switch gears and back to our uh market business if you will and talk about some calls of the day here.Uh We start with Dell Technologies which is getting a price target lift from loop capital, the firm citing legitimate gen A I progression.And it's interesting um the sort of evolution if you will or the migration and perception about Dell, which, you know, people think of as a PC company and a server company to some extent, Josh, but lately it's had this gen A I buzzings, you know, it also had a conference recently, Jensen Wong of, of NVIDIA was there.So it's been an interesting shift.Yeah, so they, they rate Della by, they raise their target to 185 and to your point Julie, they, they say, you know, their work continues to show legitimate gen A I progression in the last 90 days.Um They do go at some risk.They're called gen A I server revenue.The PC refresh cycle valuation I mean, the stock has enjoyed a remarkable run.It's something more than 250% over the past 12 months, about 100 and 20% just this year.So, investors love it.The street loves it.Yeah.And it's interesting what, um, they comment on in this saying that it's very well positioned for long term commercial it, budget wallet share.I've seen a lot of talk about wallet share recently, these enterprise um software and hardware notes that you know, where is the money going to be flowing?And we've talked about a lot of it's gonna flow to gen A I to the infrastructure and I guess Dell is now part of that infrastructure.And so that's uh part of the thesis here.By the way, it is Showtime Dell reporting its Q one earnings this week, May 30th.So we'll see we'll be ready.We are ready.All right, Morgan Stanley Muel sending a cautious tone on Celsius holdings, knowing sales growth for the energy drink maker appears to be slowing.So you saw the stock and hit today on that.Morgan Stanley is basically saying you're looking at sales growth for the company slowed sequentially in the two week period ending May 18th looks like they're citing kind of industry sales data here.And I'll say sales growth slowed to 39% year over year in the week ended May 18th and that's down from 50% in the week end of May 4th, those shares have been as Josh Lipton would say a rocket ship this year.Um They are up around 50% here as we have seen the popularity of these drinks really expand one of the other things and you know, take this with a grain of salt.There is a little bit of sort of social media chatter because there are, there, there are sort of one off reports at times about the health issues of Celsius.There was a recent report about a guy from Chattanooga who drank two a day and had liver damage that he said, he said his doctors attributed to the quantity of Celsius he was drinking.I guess the thing says you max out a two a day.Although I can't imagine how I would feel a two C a day.But, you know, so that stuff kind of percolates through as well and it does.But to your point even, I mean, the stock got hit on this today.But even so what?Right, even with this, it's still like 40% this year and most analysts still think you should buy it, not Morgan Stanley, but most are still saying this one's a buy the levels, 15 buys on the stuff.All right, coming up, we've got a slew of retailers set to report the quarterly results this week.We'll take a look at the best ways to invest in the sector with today's playbook that much more when market domination returns all eyes on the consumer.This week, a slew of retailers like Abercrombie and Fitch Costco cos they all set to report their quarterly results providing insight on customer spending.This coming as consumer confidence saw a rise in May while recession concerns still linger according to the conference board.And we're looking at how to navigate the big picture with the Yahoo Finance playbook here to discuss Barclays consumer discretionary analyst, Adrian Y along with T DC and analyst, Jonah Kim.Thank you both for being here.Appreciate it guys.I want to start big picture first, right?Because we, it's a confusing time when it comes to con consumer, right?You got consumer confidence, they rebounding, but you have a lot of the retailers talking about a trade down effect, et cetera.When we're talking about the specialty retailers in particular, the likes of an American Eagle and Abercrombie, a gap, for example, Adrian, I'll start with you kind of how are they sitting with the consumer?What share of the consumer wallet are they getting these days?I would say that this is a, an ebbing tide.We are year to date in what I call a consumer malaise.Clearly, you're seeing a pullback.The inflationary impact is now impacting not only the low end 50 K consumer, but it's starting to have a creeper effect, right?It's coming up to the 75 K and even to the kind of the, the higher household incomes.So what I would say is you have to have a trend or a brand that rises above this is the 8020 rule, 80% of stocks that are in kind of a subsector.They trade along with kind of what I call the micro macro.And you've got to find our job is to find the 20% that have some halo moment on them.American Eagle.This whole silhouette shift.I've talked to you about the denim bottoms and the kind of fashion change that's going to happen in the back to school time period.I also think Gap is our other pick here.We don't cover Abercrombie, but they would fall into kind of the companies that have momentum.Old Navy is the key at Gap brand.They are the ones that are actually turning and they are taking share in that lower and household income in their segment.And Jonah, I wanna bring you in here as well, maybe start that same high level.Jonah just ho how does the consumer look to you, Jonah, how healthy, how resilient based on on your coverage universe.The low end is definitely pressure, but we think the newness is resonating a lot with consumers at Bath and body, which is our topic.They have a new Netflix partnership, they're venturing into men's and laundry.So there is a lot of new categories there and we like the new balance that they're having in store So any newness is, is resonating quite well.And another differentiator is proprietary products and hymns is another concept that we really like.And, and that proposition is in products that, that are affordable and differentiated from other platforms.So those are the key to a strong consumer sentiment in our opinion.And J I wanna pick up what you were talking about with the um price point, right?That that value is also an important component of this.And I, I wonder sort of how does value now compare to value last year or two years ago?I mean, how, how much are consumers prioritizing that?Yeah, I think we are seeing a lot more choice for consumers.So they are prioritizing value while also being very selective in what they can spend.So as I mentioned, having that unit and differentiating factor in addition to having strong value proposition, make strong sense for consumer at this stage.Um that, yeah, that's sort of how we are seeing uh a consumer today and Adrian and, and same to you because that, that is a theme we hear Adrian, you know, if you're trying to pick on, on, on kind of trends, you hear it seemed to be this consumer who is generally more cautious, more prudent kind of focused, more Adrian on right now what they, what they need rather than what they want.I would say that's absolutely the case.Let's remember that, you know, compound inflation over the past five years is up, you know, close to 20% about 18% within kind of just apparel and accessories.Once they went through the purging process on the inventory, the average unit retails, right, the out the door pricing inclusive of prices that they took up right during the 2021.Um, time period are also up about 15 to 20%.So people are paying significantly double digit more than they were in 2019.And we're starting to see the ceiling, you know, get hit on those price points.We're seeing a ton of promotions.Memorial Day was about as emotional as we've seen it.And I don't think people made plan over this past weekend generally, you know, so we saw a lot of extensions and I think you're just going to kind of fight through kind of the summer time period until we get to the back to school season and then we have reason and need to buy and reason I need to buy.Where is the question?So, so Jona, you talked about um that BBW I is your um preferred uh stock right now, but we're also getting Gap and American Eagle this week.So just quickly tell us what your, what your stance is on those two going into the numbers.Yeah, on American Eagle and Gap, we are market perform.We see strong momentum uh in both brands, obviously, Gap is, is having its moment with uh the fashion show and others.So we are, we are seeing a lot of momentum there, but we are just a little bit more cautious on the execution and longevity of growth at both.Uh Eagle and Gap especially Gap Athleta really needs to turn around in our opinion.Navy is an important concept, but I I think there's still a little bit more focus on gap brand at the moment.So we are waiting to see more stability in in the financials.Um And also Eagle has done very well.Uh We do need to see a little bit more.Uh I think strong signs that air and offline in American Eagle.Um And, and to our point, there is a little bit of uh cautious consumer dynamics playing here.So we remain cautious, but our pick is Bath and body.Uh we select the newness and, and we think promotions are well controlled.Uh and they have 37 million loyalty members that they can continue to leverage.So there are a lot of new exciting initiatives at Bath and body works in our opinion.And Adrian, you gave us your thoughts on gap.What about American Eagle as well stock that had a a nice move already Adrian.So American Eagle, um we think that they are absolutely in the bull's eye of this kind of silhouette shift with the, you know, 40% of their sales at American Eagle are actually in denim bottoms and they are kind of the lone team player from like 10 years ago when we had Abercrombie Eagle and Postal playing in the space, uh, our promos kind of throughout the quarter and sort of quarter to date they've held in there.Right.So we hate to see deeper promos and we see them hugging the promos that they did last year to us.That kind of says that they're on plan and they should be ok. No one's going to blow away the quarter, right.So the best you can hope for is a little bit of upside, probably driven by SGN A for the quarter.A blessing of the Q two guidance, maybe a little pass through to the year and that's all we need.Oh, here you go.Sorry, go ahead.Adrian.I think we're having a little sound problem with Jonah.Oh, no, I was just saying that, that, you know, a, a little bit of a beat, an in line guide and a pastor to the year.You know, a little modest pastor.That's, that's a heroic.That would be a really good print for us.Uh All right, thanks so much guys, Adrian Jonah, thank you both for joining us today.Appreciate it while wrap it up days.Market domination.Don't go anywhere.We've got you covered with all the action following the closing bell, including earnings from KVO and at 430 Eastern time, it's the late edition of asking for a trend that got you covered with the biggest market moving stories affecting your money.Stay tuned, more market dot coverage after this.",

action  click here video transcripthello and welcome to market domination i m julie high and that just in live from our new york city headquarters  we are giving you the ultimate investing playbook to help tune out the noise and make the right move for your money and here s your headline blitz getting you up to speed one hour for the closing bell rings on wall street it s not a surprise that the consumer is feeling well it s actually been a little bit more of a surprise that the consumer had felt a bit challenged we have a historically low unemployment rate and the wealth effects of investing in the market continue to go up so it shouldn t be a  a major surprise that consumers are feeling well one thing to keep in mind is you don t know if sell in may works until  until june  right i mean  sell in april didn t work we know that sell in early may didn t work we kind of know that but we don t yet know if sell in may didn t work we re coming into this month  we re ending this month  i should say on a very exuberant note  um stock  you know  basically  no matter how you measure it there s  there s very little fear and a lot of grief  one of the key elements of the buy out products that we offer is zero interest and so to some degree  we re seeing  you know  a continuous acceleration of our growth and  and preference among us consumers due to the fact that actually from that stretch  a lot of that stretch comes from the higher interest rates on the credit cards and other lending products  right and actually to some degree biop becomes a more attractive offer  we ve got one hour to go until the market closed so let s take a look at the major averages while that exuberance over the longer term does remain intact that you heard steve so talking about just there  we ve got a little bit more of a mixed picture today and that s because the big economic data of the week comes at the end of the week that is in the form of p ce which is the feds preferred inflation indicator that said we did get a reading on consumer confidence today showed a rebound for the first time in four months that coming to us from the conference board that not really mitigating the declines we re seeing at the moment with the dow down about 300 points of about three quarters of 1  the s and p down about a quarter percent story continuesthe nasdaq is the outlier here today to the upside it s at the lows of the session but still up about a quarter percent and as we try and weigh all of this economic data  we see the 10 year note of the yield back above 4 5  we haven t seen it at that level in quite some time a pretty big move upward today of about seven basis points so  um that may be causing a little bit concern we re up about the same level that we were really coming into may so something to keep an eye on there also watching what s going on with the sectors today we ve got health care  industrials  financials that are weak energy and tech are on the rise today and speaking of tech  when we talk about the nasdaq being the outlier to the upside  we re going to dig into it later but nvidia rising to another record today  amazon and alphabet also on the rise but really uh that  that um strongest performer there would be nvidia among large cap tech  josh all right  julie stocks mixed as investors attention remains focused on the federal curve in their path to get inflation back to that 2  target for more on what s ahead for the market let s welcome in rob hayworth us bank  wealth management  senior investment strategist  rob it is good to see you so you know  you heard julie there stocks wavering today  rob but unfortunately  you know  we had a a nice rally so where do you think rob the market heads kind of near to intermediate term here do you wanna be putting more money to work at these levels rob well  certainly uh  today  this week it seems a little tough we ve got a lot of questions ahead of that fed  uh measure of inflation  the fed s preferred measure of inflation on friday  but over the longer term  yeah  we think this is a growth oriented market where the economy is holding up fairly well and there s room for earnings to continue to expand uh we ve seen analysts start to take up a full year  2024 earnings expectations we re  we re estimating around  244 a share depending upon which service you look at uh and that s probably enough to keep this market in positive territory for the year still lots of questions ahead but  but we d be constructive over the long term  maybe a little cautious watching this week as the data unfolds hey  robert  it s julie here so what could be  you know  of all of those questions which is perhaps the most dangerous for the market  so to speak wow yeah  i  well  certainly we have the election coming up that s probably uh a question but probably a couple of months down the road in the near term i think the question is what is the fed doing uh and that s some of what i think we re seeing with the tape today is there s a lot of questions from the market about fed speakers and how likely is the fed to start to cut rates we re now seeing that maybe it s not uh an event until november or december and maybe we get one this year instead of multiple uh so i think that fed uh those  those fed speakers remain highly important and how the ad inflation data evolves is where the market is going to be really focused one issue  rob  you know  i want to get your take on this because ed yardeni  the  the strategist and economist in his note to his clients this morning  rob  he really zoned in on geopolitical conflict and  and what s front and center there really and of course  you know  russia  ukraine  rob and china taiwan  israel hamas how do you think about that as a strategist in terms of just kind of economic and policy implications no  great great point it  it s something where we really haven t seen much of a market impact yet but we re for our clients  we re thinking about it as really being the epicenter in  in commodity markets  commodity markets in general are in shorter supply right now  whether we think about oil uh metals uh we re even seeing some  some supply disappointments when it comes to the us grain inventories uh so we ve actually thought that we want to own some inflation protection and portfolios against those geopolitical risks and we re thinking about broadly diversified commodity exposure there and at the same time  it s interesting because  you know  obviously those are also a risk  as you said to  to the um upside for inflation when you were talking about  um what s gonna happen with the federal reserve this year at this point does it matter to equity markets if there s a cut or not in other word is it almost agnostic to there being a cut uh i think it depends on which sectors so the agnostic part is probably the artificial intelligence and  and growth part of the market that we re seeing just natural growth rates with or without the fed cutting rates uh but we ve seen smaller companies uh interest rate  sensitive companies thinking utilities and  and real estate have struggled with higher rates for longer that could be the challenging part of the market uh is if they don t get fed rate cuts uh is there some  some further pressure on those multiples as we look over the rest of the year and  and rob just sticking with the  the fed  you know  jay powell s favorite key inflation metric uh p ce rob  we re gonna get that on friday what do you expect how important do you think that is to the market uh i think it is fairly important i mean  the surprises would be out of if we re  if we re  if we overshoot last month s reading or undershoot last month s reading right now i think consensus is about a 0 3  increase  about 2 8  year over year uh  we  we don t have anything to tell us to think differently than that  but we d be worried if there was a  make an overshoot or undershoot uh  and the mar that s where the market would really start to react um  are there any other places in the market that you think um  it  it s good to be right i mean  would you be in artificial intelligence  for example  as well as you mentioned some of those commodities but a i on the other hand  is that a good place to be well  some of those names have been uh have certainly seen a surge in the last week in the last couple of days so it s  it s tough to buy at these levels but in the longer term  yes  we think that s a place uh that investors need to have uh some money put  put invested just to be able to benefit from what looks to be longer term productivity growth but is right now  at least an epicenter epicenter of corporate investment how about fixed income investors  rob listen right now  if you re looking for advice  what s your guidance yeah  we re uh really interested in looking at credit both in the municipal space and in the corporate space we think there s room to run here even though you re seeing uh valuations are on the rich side that this solid economic growth scenario we have for the us economy is giving companies earnings room to run and earnings and some room to kind of continue to make those payments so we think there s room for investors to kind of capture that extra yield  whether it s high yield bonds  uh aaa collateralized loan obligations and in the municipal bond space  we d look to the lower quality end of the in the market because uh because we think there s high  it s still kind of low distress there and  and room for people to capture those yields all right  rob  good to see you thanks a lot thank you very much we re just getting started here on market domination coming up  shares of video are soaring to another all time high today on the back of an announcement from elon musk  we ll check in on the latest trend tickers on the other side  plus a slew of retailers are set to report quarterly results this week  providing insight on consumer spending we ll take a look at the sector in today s investor playbook and at 430 eastern time  it s the latest edition of asking for a trend i ve got you covered with the biggest market moving stories affecting your money stay tuned  more market coverage after this let s check in on some of the top trending tickers from yahoo finance com  invidia  top of the leaderboard today yet again  those shares are trending higher following an announcement from elon musk that his a i start up xa i is in the process of building a supercomputer to be powered by nvidia s chip technology really what we learned is how much he had raised in order to power that  6 billion valuing all of xa i at about  18 billion and the sort of there have been  has been talk in the past that it was gonna  he was gonna use in video chips so this confirmation that he raised the money  it was like  ok  now he has the money to pay for all this chips yeah  that s right i mean  it s interesting because what elon musk is kind of saying here is that when it comes to these ll ms  these large language models  i m gonna be a player with xa i and you kind of already know julie who some of the core winners are gonna be there like  you know  open a i and meta but he s now saying  listen  xa i is gonna be one i was impressed with some of the  the  the investors who piled in here i mean  these are marquee names and isilon valley that put money to work it s andre horowitz  it s coya and when he raised  6 billion to your point  listen  you if you re gonna be a player in ll ms  everybody knows you re gonna need nvidia so a lot of people be it are you  you just raise 6 billion how much of that is flowing rights jensen yeah  i mean  and he has said in the past that he would need the  that 100 000 specialized semiconductors for this uh for grok  which is xais chat bot exactly grok from stranger in a strange land it is a  it is a sci fi classic and to grok  something is like to implicitly understand something from your fellow human i never knew that that s what that was that s what grok is from go ahead i was just gonna say  i mean  it s interesting now because you do have the kind of different a i companies sort of clearly laid out and along with who s backing them so you have xa i  as you mentioned with sequoia and anderson  uh horowitz uh andries hor  it s behind it you have open a i that of course  has gotten  13 billion from microsoft and you ve got anthropic  4 billion from amazon so you have kind of a choose your fighter kind of situation it s also fun to think about  you know  elon musk has this empire and how kind of the pieces flow because you mentioned gro as chatbot that requires a massive amount of data to train on and so it s interesting like that ll come from x but then i ve seen these reports  they re also already thinking  ok  how much data will flow from tesla at some point too right and you ve got open a i which is forging different agreements with different news organizations and other sources to train its model so it s very interesting and you know  i won  i don t know if the quality of what they come out with  of the gen a i that they come out with is gonna depend on the  where they re drawing the data from it it s a great point because is the data that s gonna train grok that fuel a lot of it s gonna come from x is that good data we ll see i don t know  ask some questions you ask  some people have been asking all of these questions like asking gemini questions and stuff they ve been getting some wonky answers won is a nice way to make pizza anyone all right  we ll stick with elon musk led companies  tesla shares heading in the other direction today that s proxy advisory firm  glass lewis has recommended that shareholders reject a proposal to reinstate co elon musk pay package and y all will find this his very own pros submarine and joins the show now he s been tracking this story and has the latest pros hey josh  how you doing  man so yeah  you know  um we fix my collar over here uh yes so tesla here wanting to sort of have their shareholders approve musk s 2018 pay package that was  that was sort of uh rejected by a delaware court now  what s happening now is glass lewis  the the advisory proxy advisory firm says  you know what don t approve that pay package for musk it s just too excessive  right the amount of stock that people are that he is getting is excessively diluted to current shareholders more so than other pay packages that we ve seen for the sort of mega cap tech companies  but also fortune 500 sorry s and p 500 auto companies no one has seen that kind of pay package here musk would argue well  you know what  i m not actually getting a salary here look at the  look at what the stock has done over the past five years i made a lot of money for a lot of people why can t i get that pay package which was by the way in 2018  approved by stockholders so that s sort of the kind of the crux of the debate here glass is saying that it s not good for shareholders neither is the move from uh delaware incorporate incorporation to texas incorporation doesn t really make sense there s too much uncertainties with texas business law at this point so they re saying stay in delaware musk  don t get that pay package uh and oh  by the way  he s claimed that he wants at least 25  of  of  of the stockholding share and tesla always gonna pull out a i and robotics and things like that and pros the meeting is what june 13th  correct so  we ve heard from glass lewis who have we heard from and are there any big players that we re sort of waiting to hear which way they re gonna go you know  we ve had  we see some  a number of smaller shareholders  uh some small pension funds  some other types of funds that have said we re not going to uh approve this uh pay package they put together a letter last week saying that i think this is a slow drumbeat here of those sort of concerns and of course  glass lew is a bigger player in the proxy advisor was saying that this is not a good pay package  you know  but we re not surprised that glasses and probably iss will come out at some point and say the same thing but i think the big sort of concern is what is the fidelity of the world are gonna say blackrocks are they gonna say anything i doubt it uh it s gonna be up to the smaller shareholders  i guess and prize i m very interested to get your take on on this let s say shareholders rejected that pay package what do you think elon musk was  would be i m honestly not sure i don t know if he would say  you know  what  who needs this i have other areas i could put my focus on  right i got spacex i got julie and i were just talking about xa i or is it no like he s just  i mean  i can t think of another company where the founder so embedded  i mean  tesla is musk musk is tesla what  how do you  what do you think his response might be you know  he hasn t gotten paid  believe it or not in 2018  but his current holding of stock around 12 to 13  has seen his  seen that sort of his stake in the company  the  the value that go up tremendously so he s not like he s  he s suffering here uh do i see him leaving the company i don t know  maybe he steps back a little bit maybe he does fall through that threat in the xa i and what you were talking about earlier and other of his companies get more of the attention from the a i and robotics point of view it s hard to say what he might actually because he s such a mercurial character that from one whim to the next  you don t exactly know where he s gonna go with that but from a tesla point of view  i think he knows that it s too valuable for him to  if he left his stockholding would  would the shares would go down  right so i think he  he knows he s got to stay in their state  but maybe you ll actually see a better  more balanced pay package from the board  which seems like right now it s just rubber stamping a lot of what he wants that s for the impression that a lot of people have so it s hard to say  but you never know with musk  you never  never know with that guy you never do always make your beat interesting for us thank you thank you checking in on another trending ticker today in smed this is not what we talk about frequently it s a biotech company that announced positive results from a study of a drug to treat a  a rare lung condition that is called bronchi stasis much better i m glad you took a swing at that one so basically this is a lung inflammation um and uh it affects  you know  not a huge amount of people  but enough that analysts are very  very positive after seeing the results of this study yeah  i was just in terms of thailand julie company apparently plans to file for us market clearance in the final quarter of the year  then launch in mid 20 tw 25 filed by launches in europe and japan i  you know  analysts seemed very positive i saw jp morgan analyst quote as saying the findings are a home run scenario  say they see the results as transforming the company and unlocking a tree  key driver of value and it sounds like investors were plenty excited too yeah  i mean reading between the lines here  some of the other analysts  one it duo said that this should provide a huge sigh of relief for investors as we believe it helps to secure a more positive outlook on the company s future so obviously  there was some concern over that the company has never turned a profit and it has been public for quite some time about 10 years the other possibility here as the company says in its statement is this maybe has the potential to address a range of neutrophil mediated diseases this is a certain type of inflammatory disorder so there could be potentially other applications i mean  that s kind of the model with a wide range of drugs now you you get it approved for one thing and then potentially it can be used for i saw another a i was also saying here  the company  you know  does have a fair amount of debt julie so maybe i think their point was this rally we re seeing here  gives them the chance to think creatively about some possible financing options too makes sense well  let s stick with the health care uh sector  shall we because thousands of oncology professionals from around the world are set together in chicago for the asco annual meeting  the american clinical oncologists there a grid of sessions will reveal research treatments and visionary insights on cancer treatment for what more on what this means for the biotech sector let s get to jeffrey s biotech analyst  michael michael it is always great to talk to you and i can think of no one better to talk to about this meeting a number of companies have already released abstracts in advance of the asco meeting as they tend to so tell us  do you have a top one that you re gonna be watching as we get more information at the conference oh  well  it s great to be here thank you good to see you julian and josh uh obviously  uh the biggest uh cancer conference of the year uh in a week and a half will be there and it is true that much of the cat is out of the bag um maris in one of those big movers this week and all eyes are focused on some of the updated data at the presentation there and a couple of others were focused on like immuno t i mc r and moderna mrn a uh with an update on their phase three cancer vaccine or phase two cancer vaccine data already in phase three with merc so there are a couple of the ones happy to talk about others  but of course  a big cancer conference of the year and biotech is moving and shaking as it always is and michael  quick question for  you know  earlier in the show  i was talking to julie about um all things a i and of course  we talk a lot of the show about how  you know a i obviously early days michael  but there is this real interest about how this technology could kind of upend and disrupt a lot of industries i have been reading some reports there s already some talk about how  how a i could maybe reshape the field of oncology as well michael any thoughts on that well  look  um first of all  there s only a couple of sort of pure play software platform a i related companies  uh schrodinger ticker  sdgr and uh recursion rxrx which actually has a deal with nvidia um uh so check that out uh but a lot of the early investment have been going into a bunch of private companies as you can imagine  the drug discovery uh process can take 10 years and there is a wealth of discovery and work being done early on for new targets using a i and attempts at looking at large language models to discover new targets but those are pretty early uh and uh certainly a risky  but most of them are private and before we dig into some of these names that you re talking about  and um i m interested in marri  in particular  which you mentioned um i  i guess for people who are not as steeped in this as you are michael  um going into this meeting kind of  i know this is a big question where are we in terms of cancer treatment and research right kind of where are we on the curve of being able to treat most types of cancers and uh is there anything sort of revelatory that you re expecting well  you know  you re asking uh an important question and i think it depends on the time horizon of  you know  maybe 10 years ago  it was all about chemotherapy and maybe new antibodies uh from genetech like avastin over the next 5 to 7 years  we now have been on the immuno oncology  io wave certainly with pd ones and new developments across pd one and other immuno oncology  drugs  which has been fantastic and now you re on the brink of also new uh no modalities like car t uh and other attempts at cancer vaccines uh holistically like the moderna cancer vaccine and others and i think we re still looking for the next generation i think the answer is that you re not going to have a one product  one pill  cancer cure anytime soon but we are making great strides over years to make big steps in cancer and i think that when you uh perhaps has been spoiled and look at something just five or seven years ago when we did not pd one and now you look at the types of efficacy that pd one has brought for us i think we d all be pleased uh sometimes  maybe our hurdles are just uh uh a little bit too high and we re trying to find a cure but it takes time but we have been making great strides and that s why julie that people are all focused on the thousands of cancer drugs at the asco conference and investing in biotech and why all these ipos are going out is because there are great promise of the next so let s get to maris then and this company specifically came out with the results of a study in head and neck cancer mr us is the ticker and that one for people who are not familiar with it now  the stock surged  it has since come back down a little bit it hasn t retraced all of it like  how should people think about trading a stock like marris around an event like this when it  you know  because it already came out with the abstract from its study yeah um  well  look  i think that  uh  in many respects  we try to think about buying stocks in advance of all of that and jeffrey has been vated and been bullish on that going into it  the data played out in the abstract and then in the uh early presentation that they hosted this morning  uh with more data and the stock obviously has gone up over that time period and now we re at a new step where uh obviously we re going to start phase three i think most people would think about trading this as we have great data as they move forward into phase three  whether it s a potential uh take out target or obviously one of the more promising drugs that had a cancer i don t think we d be trying to day trade that but rather say that this is a very promising cancer company going to phase three could be a take out target hey  michael  can i squeeze one last one in because i m curious to get your take on this besides a i michael  i m not sure there s another trend we talk about more than g lp ones in your opinion  michael still a mega trend hot as ever and if so are there ways to play it besides eli lilly and novo nodes sure great so we have said specifically that these types of waves come once in a decade or two uh we believe that the g lp one wave is still relatively early in the multiyear cycle we believe obviously that uh lillian noble as you ve talked about  specifically lily uh is obviously attractive and they ll be a major player we have said amgen is one of the most important larger cap companies that we have been very bullish on and they too will go to phase three with a monthly g lp one and we think the data is gonna be great at the end of the year  there s also smaller companies uh like rock  uh srrk or cor that also have new modalities um that are interesting and so a lot of these smaller cap companies i think are promising because the upside potential for that data in  100 billion t a is great and the m and a potential for these is great and we still think we re relatively early in the cycle michael terrific to have you on the show thanks so much for joining us thank you guys coming up there may be reason to be optimistic in the war against climate change we re gonna tell you more on the other side when market domination returns since last year  the average person has seen nearly a month s worth of extra hotter than usual days and those additional abnormal days can be attributed to human clause caused climate change that s according to a recent analysis from nonprofit climate central but not all hope is lost at least according to my next guest  he says there is reason to be optimistic in the war against climate change climate investor and activist to steer says there is to be optimistic in that war he outlines the state of play in a new book  cheaper  faster  better how we win the climate war and he s joining me now in the studio thanks so much for being here  julie  thank you for having me um i read that report today about those hotter days and it is just the latest in a long line of really depressing news and we  you know anecdotally  we see these reports in the news every day  right about uh weather events  et cetera why are you optimistic well  let s start i i wanna start by confirming everything you say the news from the natural world has been consistently not just bad but worse than expected and in fact  this is the hottest planet that human beings have ever walked right now um but what people  so people don t always know that but what they also don t know which i know as a result of spending my time professionally investing in companies that are leading the counter revolution is that the technology is better than anybody knows that not only have solar and wind come down in cost and are  you know  really spreading quickly but that there are in the cliche in the climate world is we re not looking for a silver bullet we re looking for silver buckshot lots of companies addressing lots of problems that can win in the marketplace on their own because they are  in fact  as my book says  cheaper  faster and better  let s win in the marketplace we can do it and we need people to get together and make it happen where are we on that winning in the place right because one of the other things that you talk about is sort of getting society on the same page you talk about um and you talked about in the q and a accompanying the book as well about the effort around world war two and victory gardens and this sort of sentiment of everybody being on the same team in the same pulling in the same direction doesn t feel like that right now and it s hard to get people to make daily changes they want everything to be perfect without having to do anything well  let me say this  we re not asking people to sacrifice economically as i said  if it s not good enough to win in the marketplace  it s not going to happen but let me give you an example of something where whatever the talk is  we can see what s really happening that s texas if there s a state where the elected officials have disliked the idea of renewable energy have disliked the idea of whatever esg is it would be texas texas has tripled its amount of solar in the last three years and expected to go up another 35  this year texas produces more wind energy than any other state by far are they doing that to be nice or to be woke no  they re doing it because it s cheaper and when we look around the world  what we re seeing is these new technologies and it s fo that this follows technological breakthroughs for the last 200 years they spend a lot of time reaching cost comparability and when they break through and are cheaper  faster and better  they go straight up it s like an  it s described as an s curve and then it flattens out that s what we re seeing in a lot of technologies  not just solar and wind  but evs and heat pumps and other things you know  as you talk  i have to ask you about nuclear because there s been a recent and interest in sort of acceptability of nuclear where are you on that technology and how  what role it needs to play in all of this well  first of all  there are two different kinds of nuclear so let s try and separate the two there s the existing technology that s been around which still has plants in the united states that s fission technology people are trying to build smaller  safer fission reactors and we ll see if in fact  they can be both safe and cheap i mean  the real problem with nuclear fission has been no one s been able to build a plant in the united states for a reasonable price for a long time and so people think nuclear is somehow cheap  it s very  very expensive right now the other kind is nuclear fusion that is a new  very difficult to achieve uh engineering feat people have been saying are saying  and i ve talked to  they are probably 12 big companies trying to solve this i ve talked to the ceo s uh of two of them in the last couple of months and they say if everything goes great  we ll be meaningful in the market in 2040 that s 16 years away we really don t have 16 years to wait if it comes that s great but we need to focus on the next 10 years and really get things going so as far as i m concerned  when we think about new electricity generation  that s not the place i m looking to solve the the shorter intermediate term problem speaking of urgent  um this year is a presidential election you are a supporter of president biden  you ve held fundraisers for him um what do you think conversely a trump presidency would mean for climate change and climate change policy well  i think one of the things that i ve been trying to say is that clean energy is winning in the marketplace and it s kind of you can say whatever you want as a politician but if something is cheaper and better people are going to buy it regardless of what you have to say  that s going to go on in the united states i think  regardless  i think the big question for the united states is that under a republican administration  we are not gonna do the kind of international leadership  international cooper operation to build the kind of global institutions and measurement systems so that in fact  we can have a global response to what was once called global warming this is a problem that concerns everybody on the planet and we re not gonna have the kind of cooper operation that s necessary in co ordination without american leadership it s not like we re the only country  but we re an indispensable country and if that  in fact  the republican administration pulls back as it did under the previous administration and as they re saying  they re going to then the kind of leadership that we need and cooper with china and india and the rest of the world won t happen and that means that there will be a delay in terms of building those international systems of cooper measurement and  and standards what about even domestic legislation i mean  president  former president trump reportedly met with a bunch of oil executives said i m gonna get rid of the ira if you guys support me now  i ve spoken to some oil executives and they say they don t like the inconsistency that we ve seen in policy  right that everything flips every four years do you think he d even be able to get rid of the ira if  if he indeed wins the election i think most of the ira is stuff that has been uh deployed or where people have pushed to get things done so they can t be reversed i think most of it is in red states and it s created a lot of jobs so i believe in the un in the united states we are rolling and yes  there will be different speeds and maybe some of the new technologies will be slowed down because they won t get government support but by and large  the united states is heading on a glide path that has been laid out by the biden administration and i think that we re  it  it ll be slower and faster  but we re really gonna get there we are going to win this whole thing let me say julie  people think two things they think we re an oil and gas country and we can never get off it that is absolutely not true we will get off it it s a question of how fast and the second thing is people think we re in a climate doom loop that basically we re destroying the natural world and we can t stop ourselves from doing it and that is false what i m trying to say is this  yes  this is a crisis and it s probably a bigger crisis than most people understand but it s really a challenge for us and that s how we should think about it this is something we will win  we will win it together inevitably  this is gonna happen the question is the sooner we pull together  the sooner we work together and the sooner we recognize that we re really try all trying to make a better world for the future  a safer better world  the sooner we recognize that we all want that same thing and just decide how best to do it that s when i think the united states is going to step up and do what we ve traditionally done  which is solve the big problem  right i mean  it seems to me that s the tricky part  right i mean  again  going back to the election  how many people  for example  are voting on this issue it doesn t seem like  i mean  people are voting on inflation right now they re not necessarily thinking about climate as their biggest issue i think that s true and i think that one of the reasons i wrote this book was to say to people  this is something that really is important this is something that really affects you if you re most americans agree with me  as you said  i mean  most registered republicans agree with me they just don t prioritize it what i m saying is this is not just something we have to do this is a great opportunity for america to do the kind of things that we have done in the past that we were really built as a country to do and that involves accepting each other  not villainizing each other  but really coming together and solving big problems that s what we do best and that s what we re proudest of ourselves for tom thanks for being here the book is cheaper  faster  better how we ll win the climate war appreciate your time thank you for having me all right  let s switch gears and back to our uh market business if you will and talk about some calls of the day here uh we start with dell technologies which is getting a price target lift from loop capital  the firm citing legitimate gen a i progression and it s interesting um the sort of evolution if you will or the migration and perception about dell  which  you know  people think of as a pc company and a server company to some extent  josh  but lately it s had this gen a i buzzings  you know  it also had a conference recently  jensen wong of  of nvidia was there so it s been an interesting shift yeah  so they  they rate della by  they raise their target to 185 and to your point julie  they  they say  you know  their work continues to show legitimate gen a i progression in the last 90 days um they do go at some risk they re called gen a i server revenue the pc refresh cycle valuation i mean  the stock has enjoyed a remarkable run it s something more than 250  over the past 12 months  about 100 and 20  just this year so  investors love it the street loves it yeah and it s interesting what  um  they comment on in this saying that it s very well positioned for long term commercial it  budget wallet share i ve seen a lot of talk about wallet share recently  these enterprise um software and hardware notes that you know  where is the money going to be flowing and we ve talked about a lot of it s gonna flow to gen a i to the infrastructure and i guess dell is now part of that infrastructure and so that s uh part of the thesis here by the way  it is showtime dell reporting its q one earnings this week  may 30th so we ll see we ll be ready we are ready all right  morgan stanley muel sending a cautious tone on celsius holdings  knowing sales growth for the energy drink maker appears to be slowing so you saw the stock and hit today on that morgan stanley is basically saying you re looking at sales growth for the company slowed sequentially in the two week period ending may 18th looks like they re citing kind of industry sales data here and i ll say sales growth slowed to 39  year over year in the week ended may 18th and that s down from 50  in the week end of may 4th  those shares have been as josh lipton would say a rocket ship this year um they are up around 50  here as we have seen the popularity of these drinks really expand one of the other things and you know  take this with a grain of salt there is a little bit of sort of social media chatter because there are  there  there are sort of one off reports at times about the health issues of celsius there was a recent report about a guy from chattanooga who drank two a day and had liver damage that he said  he said his doctors attributed to the quantity of celsius he was drinking i guess the thing says you max out a two a day although i can t imagine how i would feel a two c a day but  you know  so that stuff kind of percolates through as well and it does but to your point even  i mean  the stock got hit on this today but even so what right  even with this  it s still like 40  this year and most analysts still think you should buy it  not morgan stanley  but most are still saying this one s a buy the levels  15 buys on the stuff all right  coming up  we ve got a slew of retailers set to report the quarterly results this week we ll take a look at the best ways to invest in the sector with today s playbook that much more when market domination returns all eyes on the consumer this week  a slew of retailers like abercrombie and fitch costco cos they all set to report their quarterly results providing insight on customer spending this coming as consumer confidence saw a rise in may while recession concerns still linger according to the conference board and we re looking at how to navigate the big picture with the yahoo finance playbook here to discuss barclays consumer discretionary analyst  adrian y along with t dc and analyst  jonah kim thank you both for being here appreciate it guys i want to start big picture first  right because we  it s a confusing time when it comes to con consumer  right you got consumer confidence  they rebounding  but you have a lot of the retailers talking about a trade down effect  et cetera when we re talking about the specialty retailers in particular  the likes of an american eagle and abercrombie  a gap  for example  adrian  i ll start with you kind of how are they sitting with the consumer what share of the consumer wallet are they getting these days i would say that this is a  an ebbing tide we are year to date in what i call a consumer malaise clearly  you re seeing a pullback the inflationary impact is now impacting not only the low end 50 k consumer  but it s starting to have a creeper effect  right it s coming up to the 75 k and even to the kind of the  the higher household incomes so what i would say is you have to have a trend or a brand that rises above this is the 8020 rule  80  of stocks that are in kind of a subsector they trade along with kind of what i call the micro macro and you ve got to find our job is to find the 20  that have some halo moment on them american eagle this whole silhouette shift i ve talked to you about the denim bottoms and the kind of fashion change that s going to happen in the back to school time period i also think gap is our other pick here we don t cover abercrombie  but they would fall into kind of the companies that have momentum old navy is the key at gap brand they are the ones that are actually turning and they are taking share in that lower and household income in their segment and jonah  i wanna bring you in here as well  maybe start that same high level jonah just ho how does the consumer look to you  jonah  how healthy  how resilient based on on your coverage universe the low end is definitely pressure  but we think the newness is resonating a lot with consumers at bath and body  which is our topic they have a new netflix partnership  they re venturing into men s and laundry so there is a lot of new categories there and we like the new balance that they re having in store so any newness is  is resonating quite well and another differentiator is proprietary products and hymns is another concept that we really like and  and that proposition is in products that  that are affordable and differentiated from other platforms so those are the key to a strong consumer sentiment in our opinion and j i wanna pick up what you were talking about with the um price point  right that that value is also an important component of this and i  i wonder sort of how does value now compare to value last year or two years ago i mean  how  how much are consumers prioritizing that yeah  i think we are seeing a lot more choice for consumers so they are prioritizing value while also being very selective in what they can spend so as i mentioned  having that unit and differentiating factor in addition to having strong value proposition  make strong sense for consumer at this stage um that  yeah  that s sort of how we are seeing uh a consumer today and adrian and  and same to you because that  that is a theme we hear adrian  you know  if you re trying to pick on  on  on kind of trends  you hear it seemed to be this consumer who is generally more cautious  more prudent kind of focused  more adrian on right now what they  what they need rather than what they want i would say that s absolutely the case let s remember that  you know  compound inflation over the past five years is up  you know  close to 20  about 18  within kind of just apparel and accessories once they went through the purging process on the inventory  the average unit retails  right  the out the door pricing inclusive of prices that they took up right during the 2021 um  time period are also up about 15 to 20  so people are paying significantly double digit more than they were in 2019 and we re starting to see the ceiling  you know  get hit on those price points we re seeing a ton of promotions memorial day was about as emotional as we ve seen it and i don t think people made plan over this past weekend generally  you know  so we saw a lot of extensions and i think you re just going to kind of fight through kind of the summer time period until we get to the back to school season and then we have reason and need to buy and reason i need to buy where is the question so  so jona  you talked about um that bbw i is your um preferred uh stock right now  but we re also getting gap and american eagle this week so just quickly tell us what your  what your stance is on those two going into the numbers yeah  on american eagle and gap  we are market perform we see strong momentum uh in both brands  obviously  gap is  is having its moment with uh the fashion show and others so we are  we are seeing a lot of momentum there  but we are just a little bit more cautious on the execution and longevity of growth at both uh eagle and gap especially gap athleta really needs to turn around in our opinion navy is an important concept  but i i think there s still a little bit more focus on gap brand at the moment so we are waiting to see more stability in in the financials um and also eagle has done very well uh we do need to see a little bit more uh i think strong signs that air and offline in american eagle um and  and to our point  there is a little bit of uh cautious consumer dynamics playing here so we remain cautious  but our pick is bath and body uh we select the newness and  and we think promotions are well controlled uh and they have 37 million loyalty members that they can continue to leverage so there are a lot of new exciting initiatives at bath and body works in our opinion and adrian  you gave us your thoughts on gap what about american eagle as well stock that had a a nice move already adrian so american eagle  um we think that they are absolutely in the bull s eye of this kind of silhouette shift with the  you know  40  of their sales at american eagle are actually in denim bottoms and they are kind of the lone team player from like 10 years ago when we had abercrombie eagle and postal playing in the space  uh  our promos kind of throughout the quarter and sort of quarter to date they ve held in there right so we hate to see deeper promos and we see them hugging the promos that they did last year to us that kind of says that they re on plan and they should be ok  no one s going to blow away the quarter  right so the best you can hope for is a little bit of upside  probably driven by sgn a for the quarter a blessing of the q two guidance  maybe a little pass through to the year and that s all we need oh  here you go sorry  go ahead adrian i think we re having a little sound problem with jonah oh  no  i was just saying that  that  you know  a  a little bit of a beat  an in line guide and a pastor to the year you know  a little modest pastor that s  that s a heroic that would be a really good print for us uh all right  thanks so much guys  adrian jonah  thank you both for joining us today appreciate it while wrap it up days market domination don t go anywhere we ve got you covered with all the action following the closing bell  including earnings from kvo and at 430 eastern time  it s the late edition of asking for a trend that got you covered
