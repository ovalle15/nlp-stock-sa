                    "Datadog (DDOG) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this data analytics and cloud monitoring company have returned +6.6%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.6% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Software industry, which Datadog falls in, has gained 3.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Datadog is expected to post earnings of $0.34 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +21.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.42 points to a change of +7.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.73 indicates a change of +22.3% from what Datadog is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Datadog is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Story continuesThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Datadog, the consensus sales estimate of $590.1 million for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +22.5%. The $2.57 billion and $3.14 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +20.7% and +22.2%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryDatadog reported revenues of $589.65 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +25.6%. EPS of $0.44 for the same period compares with $0.26 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $566.7 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.05%. The EPS surprise was +2.33%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Datadog is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Datadog. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

                    "Datadog (NASDAQ: DDOG) attracted a stampede of bulls when it went public. The cloud-based software provider priced its initial public offering (IPO) at $27 on Sept. 19, 2019, and its stock opened at $40.35 before rallying to a record high of $196.56 on Nov. 9, 2021.At its peak, Datadog's market cap hit $61.3 billion -- or 36 times the revenue it would generate in 2022. But today, it trades at about $126 with a market cap of $41.8 billion -- which is just 16 times the revenue it's expected to generate in 2024.Image source: Getty Images.The bulls retreated as Datadog's growth cooled off and rising rates compressed its valuations, but it's still more than quadrupled from its IPO price. Could this niche cloud player eventually become a cloud titan like Microsoft?What does Datadog do?Datadog's platform monitors diagnostic data from an organization's cloud servers, databases, and applications in real time. It aggregates all of that information onto unified dashboards to help IT professionals to spot potential problems.From 2019 to 2022, Datadog's annual revenue had a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 67%. Its number of large customers, which generate over $100,000 in annual recurring revenue (ARR), more than tripled during those three years.But in 2023, Datadog's revenue only rose 27% to $2.13 billion as its number of large customers grew 15% to 2,780. For 2024, it expects its revenue to rise 20% to 21%. Analysts expect its revenue to grow at a CAGR of 25% from 2023 to 2026.Datadog blamed its recent slowdown on the macro headwinds, which drove many companies to scrutinize their spending on cloud-based applications. However, it still kept its net revenue retention rate around 115% over the past 12 months.As its revenue growth cooled off, it reined in its spending to stabilize its margins. From 2019 to 2023, its adjusted operating margin improved from negative 1.5% to positive 23%. It turned profitable on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis in 2023, and analysts expect its GAAP net income to grow at a CAGR of 58% from 2023 to 2026.Datadog is still growing, but its market is maturing. The global observability tools and platform market could only expand at a CAGR of 11.7% from 2023 to 2028, according to Markets and Markets, and it's already saturated with similar services like Cisco Systems' AppDynamics and Splunk, Dynatrace, New Relic, LogicMonitor, Microsoft's Azure Monitor, and IBM's Instana.Could Datadog become the next Microsoft?Today's Datadog is comparable to Microsoft back in fiscal 1992 (which ended in June 1992), when the future tech giant only generated $2.8 billion in revenue. From fiscal 1992 to fiscal 2023, its revenue grew at a CAGR of 15% to $211.9 billion.Story continuesTo maintain a CAGR of 15% for more than three decades, Microsoft dominated the PC operating system and productivity software markets, transformed its desktop software into mobile and cloud-based apps, expanded its own cloud infrastructure platform, grew its Xbox gaming business through acquisitions, and made some big investments in the AI market.The saturation of the observability market could make it tough for Datadog to generate comparable revenue growth over the next three decades. Datadog has expanded its ecosystem with a few acquisitions, but it doesn't seem interested in evolving into a consumer-facing cloud, mobile, artificial intelligence (AI), gaming, and hardware company like Microsoft.Instead, Datadog should continue to operate behind the scenes and help companies closely monitor their cloud-based applications. That niche focus suggests it's far more likely to be acquired -- just as AppDynamics, Splunk, and NewRelic were in recent years -- instead of staying independent and evolving into a tech titan like Microsoft.Should you invest $1,000 in Datadog right now?Before you buy stock in Datadog, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Datadog wasn’t one of them.

                    'Indonesia Energy Corporation LimitedCompany’s Profit Share Increases by More Than 100%Proved Reserves Also Anticipated to Increase Given Extended Contract TermCompany Also Provides Update on Development Plans for 2023 and 2024JAKARTA, INDONESIA AND DANVILLE, CA, Sept. 07, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Indonesia Energy Corporation (NYSE American: INDO) ("IEC"), an oil and gas exploration and production company focused on Indonesia, today announced that its joint operation contract with Pertamina, the Indonesian state-owned oil and gas company, covering the Kruh Block has been amended to extend the contract term by 5 years from May 2030 to September 2035. Kruh Block covers approximately 63,000 acres and is located onshore on the Island of South Sumatra in Indonesia.The amended joint operation contract has the following key terms:The amended contract increases IEC’s after-tax profit split from the current 15% to 35%, for an increase of more than 100%.In addition, given the 5-year extended term of the contract, the amended contract is expected to increase IEC’s proved reserves at Kruh Block by over 40%.Furthermore, given the increased profit split, IEC’s anticipated net cash flow calculations based on its Kruh Block development plan are expected to increase by over 200% versus IEC’s anticipations under the prior contract.IEC also provided an update on its Kruh Block development plan. As previously announced, in order to maximize the production at Kruh Block, IEC is in the process of conducting a workover of the existing Kruh-21 well which was drilled in 2015. Regarding the Kruh-28 well, as previously announced, IEC unexpectedly found evidence of a potential natural gas bearing reservoir between the 976 and 1,006 feet interval with 30 feet net thickness. This initial evidence was supported by both wireline logging and geologic logging data, and subsequent gas flaring. At present, IEC is in the process of sourcing a suitable rig for the workover of K-21 and K-28 wells which is planned to be conducted in the later part this year. The production from these two wells is anticipated to begin in 2024.Additionally, a 3D seismic program at Kruh Block, including data acquisition, processing and interpretation will be conducted in early 2024. The result of this seismic program is expected to help IEC estimate the size and potential of new oil and gas reservoirs and upgrade some of the unproved reserves to the proved category.IEC believes that this new work at Kruh Block, together with what has been learned from the 2022 oil and gas discoveries, is greatly assisting IEC in ascertaining the best locations to conduct its continuous drilling campaign at Kruh Block that will look to develop not only the one formation currently being targeted, but also look to develop what appears to be at least three additional oil formations that could contain significant commercial quantities of oil and natural gas. After completion and full interpretation of this seismic operations, IEC plans to re-start its continuous drilling campaign at Kruh Block in 2024. IEC still plans on drilling a total of 18 new wells at Kruh Block (4 of which have already been completed), by the end of 2026.Story continuesAt the same time, on IEC’s million-acre Citarum Block, IEC expects to receive the environmental permit for two-dimensional seismic data acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2023, which would allow IEC to begin the data acquisition work in the first quarter of 2024.Mr. Frank Ingriselli, IEC\'s President, commented "We are very excited about our Kruh Block contract extension and the significantly improved terms, where we get a significantly larger piece of all the oil produced which, in turn, drives improved reserves and potential future cash flows. All of this bodes well for our company as we look to recommence drilling at Kruh Block in 2024 with the benefit of information from our 2023 exploration activities. We continue to believe that Kruh Block is a world class asset and, in order to maximize future production capability, the seismic operations planned across the entire Kruh Block should positively leverage what we have learned from our previous discoveries, including our 2022 gas discovery, and determine the best locations to re-start our continuous drilling campaign. Additionally, we have now also moved forward with activities at our potential billion-barrel equivalent natural gas 1,000,000-acre Citarum Block, where the previous operator drilled a few gas discoveries. In short, we’ve never been more excited about IEC’s potential, and we look forward to continuing our efforts as we seek to drive positive shareholder value."About Indonesia Energy Corporation LimitedIndonesia Energy Corporation Limited (NYSE American: INDO) is a publicly traded energy company engaged in the acquisition and development of strategic, high growth energy projects in Indonesia.

                    "Indonesia, a country that continues to be heavily dependent on coal, has just announced a major investment in a renewable energy plan, marking an important shift. The funding comes from global lenders and is expected to spur greater investment in Indonesia’s renewable energy sector, as well as support decarbonisation. However, the Asian country will require significantly more funding in the coming decades if it hopes to undergo a meaningful transformation.This month, the Indonesian government announced a new investment plan that will provide $20 billion in funding from global lenders to develop its renewable energy resources. The Comprehensive Investment and Policy Plan (CIPP) is led by the United States and Japan. Indonesia's Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) outlines the aim of cutting grid emissions to 250 million metric tonnes of CO2 by 2030, compared to the previous estimate of over 350 million.Using the funding to support decarbonisation aims, Indonesia now hopes to increase the contribution of renewable energy to the total energy mix to 44 percent by 2030, from just 12 percent in 2022. Erick Thohir, the ad-interim chief minister for investment affairs, stated, “We have to move quickly because 2030 is less than seven years away. The partnership must be enhanced and accelerated to do the priority projects, including to immediately realise the financing commitments.”Indonesia continues to rely heavily on coal, with around 60 percent of the country's electricity coming from the fossil fuel. While much of the world is moving away from coal, in favour of less-polluting natural gas or renewable alternatives, Indonesia is one of several Asian countries that expects to continue to use coal for years to come. Indonesia is the world's largest exporter of coal for electricity, having built more coal plants than it knows what to do with in recent decades due to misguided national energy demand projections.Before discussions of the CIPP commenced, Indonesia’s President Joko Widodo committed to stop constructing new coal plants. However, the CIPP includes an exemption to building new coal plants if they are already in the pipeline or attached to national development projects. This potential loophole could allow Indonesia to continue expanding its coal capacity while claiming to support a green transition.In September, Indonesia’s state utility, Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN), said the country would require around $172 billion in funding by 2040 for renewable energy projects and improvements to the grid to add 60GW of new renewable capacity. This includes a $5 billion investment for developing a smart grid, which would support the delivery of variable green energy such as wind and solar power. PLN is aiming to add 32GW of new capacity as a base load, as well as construct new grids to connect an additional 28 GW of renewable power as a variable load.Story continuesEvy Haryadi, the director of PLN, explained, “There is no transition without transmission. That is the first challenge, how we transmit power from the fairly remote location to the demand.” Meanwhile, the CEO of the company, Darmawan Prasodjo, stated, “With this accelerated renewable energy development, 75 percent of our additional generation capacity will be based on renewables and 25 percent will be gas-based.”While the $20 billion in funding is unlikely to contribute to a complete transformation of Indonesia’s energy sector, it is expected to help the Southeast Asian state get on the road to decarbonisation and attract more funding to the sector. However, some have criticised the CIPP for providing market-rate loans rather than special financing schemes, which will lead to high costs for Indonesia and could deter other countries from accepting similar deals in the future.In October 2022, the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) published its Indonesia Energy Transition Outlook to encourage investors to finance the country’s green transition. It suggested that because Indonesia is the highest energy consumer among the Member States of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) it is key to the global energy transition, particularly as its economy and population are expected to grow significantly over the next few decades. Indonesia has a wide supply of renewable resources and the opportunity to tap into its green potential so long as it can attract higher levels of funding.The CIPP is expected to provide Indonesia with the initial funding needed to kick-start its green transformation. The Southeast Asian country has an abundant supply of renewable resources and the potential to become a major supplier of clean energy in the region. However, to achieve this, the government must follow through on its pledge to halt the construction of any new coal plants in favour of green alternatives.By Felicity Bradstock for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Top Semiconductor Companies Control 98% of Global MarketBrazil Eyes Major Oil Output Boost Despite Environmental ConcernsChina's Global Economic Dominance Begins to WaneRead this article on OilPrice.comView comments",
